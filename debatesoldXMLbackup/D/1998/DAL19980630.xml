      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1997 I began discussions with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs with a view to developing a strategy for systematic engagement with persons who have been on the live register for a given period of time.  We agreed to develop a strong element of co-operation between our two Departments and FÁS in order to progress this initiative.  As a consequence, the discussions were continued by officials of our two Departments in the following months.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of understanding on co-operation has now been agreed between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and procedures for operational co-operation will be further developed in a series of protocols between the two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's Employment Action Plan, published and laid before the House last April, sets out in detail the strategy we intend to follow in this and other areas.  Specifically, the plan refers to procedures being put in place to engage systematically with persons who have been on the live register for six months in the case of persons under 25 and one year in the case of those over 25, with a view to offering a job or other employability support.  The first phase of the programme <Col N="430" /> will concentrate on the under 25s and will be introduced systematically from September 1998.</P>
    <P>The overall financial provision available for the employability pillar of the EU guidelines, under which this initiative falls, is just under £900 million. The process is modelled generally on the youth progression programme introduced for 18 and 19 year olds in October 1996.  A first evaluation of that programme shows that it increased the rate of exit of 18 and 19 year olds from the live register by some 20 percentage points, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The further phased extension of this programme to over 25s who have been unemployed for one year will obviously be informed by the experience of operating the first phase of the programme from September next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the memorandum of understanding agreed between the Department and FÁS?  The Tánaiste stated that procedures were being put in place with a view to offering a job or training.  Does she agree she has gone back on her statement to the SFA meeting that adults who had crossed the 12 month threshold and who refused an offer of training or a job would be cut off social welfare benefit?  What is the position regarding the skills of people to whom an offer is made?  Will they be given advice on whether they should accept the offer or will they be automatically cut off social welfare benefit, as the Minister appears to imply, even if they consider they are not able to take up the job offer or training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum of understanding was agreed a number of weeks ago, shortly after Easter I think, although I do not have the precise date.  As I told Deputy Owen in my initial reply, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and I began discussions on this issue last November.  Since then officials from our Departments have met on a bi-weekly basis. There have been a large number of meetings since last November.  Agreement was reached between both Departments and FÁS shortly after the plan was published, as I understand it.  I do not have the date when the memorandum was drawn up but I will revert to the Deputy on that matter.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Owen knows, I referred to this matter when we were dealing with the Estimates for the Department a number of weeks ago.  At that meeting I spoke about the need to introduce conditionality, when Deputy Richard Bruton complained that people were currently being sent by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to jobs that were available.  That is the existing law which is quite clear.  Under current regulations, if one refuses employment or a training option one is automatically disqualified from unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  A requirement of receiving that benefit is that one is available for work and that one accepts a reasonable offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am simply extending the Youth Progression <Col N="431" /> Programme for 18 and 19 year olds, which the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, introduced during the lifetime of the last Government.  The programme has worked extremely well and has provided opportunities for 18 and 19 year olds.  Clearly, the opportunity will be matched to the skill of the person.  There will be no question of somebody being asked to take something that does not suit their circumstances or skills.</P>
    <P>There is an appeals procedure in the case of persons who may have their benefits taken away from them.  An officer of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will make the decision, which is the current law.  However, in the event of somebody's payments or entitlements being taken from them, their dependants will be entitled to apply for supplementary welfare benefit.  That is the existing law which will be more vigorously enforced.  We will now offer opportunities and will provide them through systematic engagement and by contacting people. Once people under 25 hit the six month deadline they will be contacted automatically.  They will be met by a representative of FÁS and will be offered the opportunity to train, to take up work if a job is available &mdash; perhaps community employment &mdash; or the chance to return to education. If they refuse reasonable offers we will make that fact known to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the normal procedures will apply in such a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that after she made her statement at the Small Firms' Association, a number of Ministers &mdash; but particularly the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs &mdash; sought to distance themselves from her statements and to repackage what she had said.  Will she confirm that kind of discussion took place with other Ministers behind the scenes?</P>

      <P>On 4 June 1998, I received an interim report from Mr. Martin Cosgrove, the authorised officer who was appointed on 23 March last under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, to investigate possible breaches of insurance legislation in relation to National Irish Bank Ltd.  and its associated companies.</P>
      <P>Having taken legal advice on Mr. Cosgrove's interim report, I have in recent weeks furnished copies to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd.  and the Revenue Commissioners for their consideration.</P>
      <P>As a result of information contained in Mr. Cosgrove's interim report, I determined that it was both necessary and appropriate to seek the appointment of a High Court inspector to examine the affairs of National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.</P>
      <P>The High Court granted my petition on 15 June and the remit of the inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd.  now extends to its associated company. As a result of this decision, Mr. Cosgrove's investigation is now being suspended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I led a delegation of over 20 Irish companies to the US from 21 June to 26 June. The companies involved were mainly electronics and software companies but they also included <Col N="433" /> sub-supply companies to the multinational high technology sector.  The purpose of this initiative was twofold.  First, it was designed to foster business partnerships between US and Irish companies in the broad electronics and software sectors. Second, it was geared to introducing sub-supply companies to the procurement procedures and executives of leading US multinationals.</P>
      <P>The business partnership mission focused mainly on the Boston and Silicon Valley areas. It was organised by Forbairt and the US Small Business Administration under the US Ireland Business Partnership Programme.  Three new business partnership agreements were concluded during the course of the week.  There is considerable potential for further agreements arising from the week's endeavours.  On behalf of the Government, I want to put on record my appreciation of the assistance of the US Small Business Administration and the support during the visit of Senator Edward Kennedy and the city of San Jose.</P>
      <P>There is also considerable further potential in exploiting linkages with top US multinationals, many of whom are based in Ireland.  During last week, together with executives from six sub-supply companies, I met representatives of Dell, 3 Com and Hewlett Packard.  I hope these endeavours will also bear fruit.</P>
      <P>As regards Motorola, I met senior management in Motorola on Tuesday, 23 June in Chicago.  I strongly represented the case for the Motorola operations in Dublin and Cork and hope that these representations will assist in maximising employment in Ireland arising from Motorola's global restructuring plans.  I was assured that both the company's Dublin and Cork operations have a strong future.  Motorola will also consider Ireland as a location for further investment projects.</P>
      <P>I met Mr. William Farley, chairman and chief executive officer of Fruit of the Loom, on 23 June in Chicago to discuss the US company's plans for its Irish operations.  This was my fourth meeting with him since taking office last year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
      <P>The clothing and textiles industries world-wide are experiencing severe competitive pressures. Change is constant and in that environment there are no guarantees; that is the reality of the business world.  The clothing industry in western Europe has been declining in the face of competition from low cost countries.  This, coupled with liberalising world trade, has resulted in clothing companies in Europe and the US seeking cheaper sources of production.  For example, Fruit of the Loom has been engaged in the retrenchment of its US-based operations for some time.  Mr. Farley indicated to me that he is keeping the business in Donegal under constant review in the light of market forces.  He stated that he will be visiting Donegal shortly as part of this review process.  He will keep in touch with IDA Ireland and myself as the review progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> As regards Apple, I understand that the company began a review of its Cork operation last March, following the appointment of Mr. Tim Cook as the new senior vice-president of world-wide operations.  This was followed by indications that Apple planned to relocate its circuit board, PCBA, manufacturing to a location with cheaper labour costs in the Far East, a move that could result in job losses in Cork.</P>
    <P>On Friday last, 26 June, with the chief executive of IDA Ireland, I met senior management, including Mr. Tim Cook and Mr. Fred Anderson, chief financial officer, from Apple Computer in San Jose to discuss the company's Cork operations. At the meeting I emphasised the importance of Apple Cork and expressed the hope that employment at the plant would be maximised, with consideration given to locating new activities there.  In the circumstances, my meeting with Apple senior management was positive.  I am pleased with assurances given to me that Apple Cork will continue to be a core strategic part of Apple Computer.</P>
    <P>While a decision regarding the future role of the Cork printed circuit board facility has not yet been finalised, a decision by the company is imminent.  In this regard, I have secured a commitment that Apple will engage in direct discussion with its workforce and their representatives and that Mr. Cook will visit Cork, probably as early as this week.  Meanwhile, senior officials from my Department are briefing Apple union representatives on my US meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she met senior management in Motorola and that she hopes her representations will maximise jobs.  Did Motorola indicate that it would have to reduce its workforce in Swords or Cork?  As regards further investment in Ireland, did she indicate to Motorola that she wanted to secure existing jobs and investments already made so that people working in Motorola would not lose their jobs?  Did the Minister receive confirmation from Apple that there would be no job losses and that it would not move its PCB facility from Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My meeting with Motorola was to ensure that the jobs in both Swords and Cork are secure and also to get new business for Ireland, particularly now that it has restructuring plans.  I was happy with my meeting with Motorola.  It is impressed with its Irish operation in Swords and Cork and there is a good possibility of more business. However, Motorola, like all companies, does not give assurances.  It must compete in a competitive marketplace.  The global economy is changing rapidly and with the liberalisation of trade, all companies, whether they are involved in textiles, clothing, electronics or software, must be able to compete and make rapid decisions.  As long as Ireland remains competitive, Motorola has a strong future both in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My meeting with Apple went much better than expected.  As the Deputy knows, Apple had been <Col N="435" /> losing market share to its competitors over the past number of years.  There has been a cloud hanging over the Apple operation in Cork since 1992.  The PCB facility is under review.  Cork is the only place where Apple makes circuit boards. It made the point to me that it required economies of scale and that the Far East is more competitive for such business.  There was speculation in the media that there would be 500 job losses in Apple in Cork.  However, I do not think that will happen.  The assurances we got, in so far as one can get assurances in this area, were satisfactory. Because of the confidential nature of the meeting, I am precluded from further discussion on that issue.</P>
    <P>Since the arrival of Mr. Cook, who is the head of strategic review for Apple and who came from one of its competitor companies, the company has begun to turn its affairs around.  He is coming to Ireland tomorrow at my request to meet the unions and staff representatives.  The company wants to engage directly with its workers in the first instance and I believe that is the right thing to do.  I have also asked the assistant secretary in charge of industry in my Department to go to Cork today to meet the unions and staff representatives so that they can be briefed in so far as I am free to brief them about the outcome of my meeting.  It was more positive than anticipated.  I believe that for as long as Apple is secure, Apple in Cork is secure.  Perhaps this is the first time any Minister could say that in the past five years. My predecessor had as much concern as I had about Apple's operation in Cork because of the performance of the company globally.  I believe the decisions Apple is about to make in relation to the Cork operation will secure its future.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, she has put in place or plans, if any, she will put in place to prevent people from claiming copyright over traditional Irish music and other works which have not traditionally been subject to copyright ownership; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since copyright can only subsist in original works in which particular authors are in a position to claim copyright, the use of pure original pieces of traditional music in original performances is not restricted by copyright.  Copyright can attach to particular recordings and original arrangements of traditional music, but such a copyright will apply only to the particular recording or arrangement in question &mdash; no copyright interest in the basic traditional music resource will be captured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> I am most concerned that the proper relationship between copyright and traditional music be maintained and that, in consequence, the free use of traditional music in original performance should not be undermined in any way by any inappropriate application of copyright law. Accordingly, my Department will be monitoring this area in the period leading up to the enactment of the forthcoming Copyright and Related Rights Bill and should any specific measures to secure the free use of pure traditional music resources be required, Deputies may be assured that such measures will be considered in the context of the enactment of that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying he has measures ready to put in place immediately should they be required or that he will wait until the damage is done before he starts thinking about them?  What might such measures be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss this matter, on which we had a significant debate in the Seanad.  There are genuine concerns about pure traditional music in this regard. Tomorrow we will finalise the short Bill, the intellectual property (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and the more comprehensive Bill will be introduced in a number of months.  I am anxious to monitor the situation.  I have had discussions with representatives of Comhaltas Ceoltóiri Éireann and IMRO on this issue.  I want to get the balance right.  As I understand it and as I have been advised by the Attorney General's office, traditional Irish music is secure because it is not possible to capture copyright in the original piece.  As the Deputy is aware, there can be a copyright for sound recordings and arrangements, but we are talking about the original piece.</P>
      <P>For example, copyright is available for the arrangements and sound recordings of O'Riada's music and some of them have been deposited with Gael Linn, but that does not give O'Riada's estate the right to stop performances of, for example, O'Carolan's concerto, which is the pure original performance.  This is a complex area. There is a great difference between sound recordings and arrangements and the pure original piece.  That is the legal position and my advice.  I can assure the Deputy I will monitor this area because I and other Deputies are concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not indicate what measures he might put in place.  Some traditional Irish music is not subject to copyright.  Will the Minister of State agree, given the Bill that is before the House, there is a danger such music could be digitised and copyright claimed on it? That is happening already.  Other countries, such as France, have put measures in place to prevent that.  What measures has the Minister of State in mind to prevent that happening here? <Col N="437" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is obviously referring to a welcome wider debate about not just the folklore and traditional music of Ireland but, for example, the music and dance of Africa.  This is an ongoing debate and there is a question with regard to the State's interest in this area.  We are talking too not just about my Department but about the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and whether we perceive folklore and traditional music as a natural resource as we should.</P>
      <P>However, in legal terms the Deputy will agree we need to introduce the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, because our law is out of date and other countries have introduced such legislation. The experience of the UK is valuable and I have studied what they have been doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of copyright legislation is to protect copyright holders and that is important for arrangements for sound recordings. However, according to my legal advice, pure traditional music is protected because, as I indicated in my initial reply, there is no author involved. One cannot take out copyright on the original piece.  I am anxious to monitor the situation.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the loss of long-term payments for those who have completed community employment acting as a disincentive to people taking up places on this scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Community employment is designed primarily to provide temporary work experience opportunities for long-term unemployed people which would convince potential employers of their suitability to fill vacancies.  It is not the intention that the programme be used as a delivery vehicle for long-term training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structure of the CE programme was revised in 1996 following an in-depth examination by the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment. The task force concluded that the focus of the programme should be to prepare participants <Col N="438" /> to progress into mainstream jobs and that work placements should be for a maximum of one year on the CE integration option and a maximum of three years on the part-time job option.</P>
    <P>A review of CE by Deloitte &amp; Touche is nearing completion and I expect to be in possession of it shortly.  The report will be comprehensive and will be expected to comment on whether CE, as it is presently designed, is an appropriate intervention in current labour market conditions.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to present the report to Government, to have it laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and to publish it and make it available to as wide an audience as possible.</P>
    <P>CE participants are eligible to retain any secondary social benefits they had prior to participating in the programme.  It is the Governments intention that the tax and welfare system should act as an incentive, rather than as a disincentive, to those out of work to enter training or take up employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister described the theory behind CE and previous schemes, which operated since the mid 1980s when there were only a few thousand schemes.  The CE scheme has been developed to the point where there are about 41,000 schemes at present.  The Minister is probably aware, that in many local schemes in the Dublin city and county areas there are participants who, as part of the training which FÁS and the local community sponsors have organised, are undergoing long-term training which might take up to four years, some of which involves third level education.  I am thinking of one group in the south inner city training to be full-time counsellors and working hard in the anti-drugs movement. It needs at least one extra year.  While I accept the Minister's point in relation to the review of the scheme by Deloitte &amp; Touche, training courses have been organised which run longer than three years which may prove valuable for the individual concerned and the wider community. I understand the Minister may have attended the meeting of Employment and Social Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg recently.  Our Swedish and German colleagues have community employment systems in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be making a statement.  He should, please, ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The system in Germany has been in place since 1947 and has had a fundamental impact in terms of the training of individuals and the building of communities.  The time has come to make some fundamental changes to enhance the scheme in place here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Community employment is not intended to be seen as a long-term training route but it is hard to have rigid rules which apply in all cases.  The points made by the Deputy are <Col N="439" /> valid.  When the Deloitte &amp; Touche report is published in the next two weeks or so &mdash; perhaps we will have an opportunity to discuss it at one of the committees of the House &mdash; we may have an opportunity to change some of the scheme's provisions. We are all seeking to achieve the same objectives.  I am acutely conscious that in some communities in inner city and suburban Dublin, inner city Cork, Limerick and Galway as well as in rural areas where it may be difficult to attract sufficient participants to put a scheme in place, hard and fast rules do not always operate satisfactorily. When I receive the Deloitte &amp; Touche report we can look at some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the £300 training grant available under the community employment scheme is considered to be inadequate by many participants and that money was handed back as it was not spent in the year in which it was allocated?  Will the Minister discuss with FÁS the adequacy of the training courses available to participants combining the scheme with training?  Currently training is optional.  If training courses were better targeted and held at more suitable times, more people would get more out of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £300 has been the subject of complaints.  I met a number of groups recently which complained that it was inadequate. This will be considered as part of the review which will take place following the receipt of the consultants' report.  The purpose of the training provision is to bring long-term unemployed persons in particular to the stage where they will be able to access real and sustainable jobs by way of worthwhile community projects.  The ideal is to marry all these elements together to ensure participants gain something worthwhile.  This may not be true in all cases, particularly where training is not provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that we all make representations on the type of case envisaged here where an extension would prove helpful.  Does she have any figures on the departure from the norm, whether it be extensions from two years to three years, granted because of the peculiar requirements of the training needs of the sponsored project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the statistics the Deputy has requested.  Approximately 71 per cent of those who participated in community employment schemes during the past 12 months accessed real and sustainable jobs.  That is a satisfactory figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: The Minister said this is an area in which one should not have hard and fast rules because of the complexities involved.  ELAH, a voluntary counselling service <Col N="440" /> based in Dublin 8 and accredited to the Irish association of counsellors and therapists, provides a five year training programme for participants from more marginalised socio-economic groupings. FÁS has granted this organisation, which is run by a number of very committed women, a special three year status, but it will still face a shortfall of two years.  Will the Minister agree to make special arrangements to extend the CE scheme to the full five years in this instance?  The result would be that the ELAH's members would gain a worthwhile qualification and would be in a position to participate professionally in drug treatment programmes and community based counselling services, which are urgently needed in areas in Dublin and elsewhere which have been hard hit economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations were made to me recently in respect of the group to which Deputies Joe Higgins and Broughan referred.  I do not want to make a decision prior to receiving the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  Suffice it to say that we want to be practical.  Five years may be necessary in exceptional cases but there are many people who want to access community employment. It is a case of trying to marry the various needs with the budgetary resources available.</P>
      <P>I will examine the requests made by Deputies and the organisation in question to see if we can facilitate the ongoing training of its members and if a five year period is necessary.  While the organisation has expertise in this area and has stated that such a period is required, that does not mean we are obliged to accept its advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the review of FÁS, will the Minister consider the role of employers as trainers? Employers receive funding from FÁS to pay unemployed people while they are training.  I am not blaming FÁS but it might be better if permanent jobs were created.  I suggest that using employers &mdash; be they involved in the hotel or retail industries &mdash; as trainers under the supervision of FÁS would create additional jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of employers as trainers has been considered in the context of Enterprise Ireland, to which responsibility for a large part of FÁS's services to business division is being transferred to encourage employers to focus on the need to train employees.  This year additional funding was made available for the training of employed people.  There are various models we can use because FÁS is not the answer to all problems involving training and a number of other organisations do outstanding work in this area.  It is a question of trying to ensure that we discover the most efficient way of training the maximum number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the ongoing review, it would not have made sense to change the existing rules until its investigations are complete.  Given that this will happen in the next fortnight, we will be in <Col N="441" /> a better position to consider these issues at that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of events surrounding the publication of other reports, will the Minister give a commitment not to publish the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on a Saturday or Sunday evening and will she give Opposition Deputies adequate notice of its publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that this year's targets for people taking up community employment schemes have not been reached and that many individuals are opting for the area allowance scheme?  I understand only 21,000 of 27,000 places have been taken up on CE schemes which means that 6,000 remain available.  Is there any reason for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various schemes and different things work for different people.  The part-time jobs scheme is very attractive for a certain cohort of people.  I do not believe there are many vacancies left for community employment schemes, in fact there is a huge demand for places.  It is a question of trying to put in place a good regional spread in respect of community employment.  This year approximately 41,000 people will be involved in CE schemes.  That is a high number, given the state of the economy and the numbers of individuals involved in other programmes. The system is satisfactory but we intend to address any gaps which may exist in it.</P>
      <P>To be fair FÁS has responded rapidly to the huge number of participants &mdash; 41,000 &mdash; in community employment throughout the country, which shows a great determination on its part. The system is working satisfactorily but gaps and overlaps appear from time to time.  Deputy Perry and others contacted me recently about rural areas where there are not enough people to meet the qualifying criteria to start a community employment scheme.  We must ensure that in urban and rural areas community employment is accessible to as many as possible who wish to participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 49 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a national minimum hourly wage is a key commitment in the programme for Government &mdash; one which I support fully and intend to implement.  This is the first Government to commit itself to the implementation of a national minimum wage and, in doing so, to protect otherwise vulnerable sections of our workforce.  The importance which the Government and I attach to this commitment is indicated by the fact that, within weeks of coming into office, we established the National Minimum Wage Commission to make recommendations on the issue.</P>
      <P>The report of the National Minimum Wage Commission, which was published on 5 April last, was an important stage in this process and one which charts the way towards achieving our objectives.  I welcomed the commission's recommendation for the introduction of a single national minimum hourly wage and the Government intends to introduce legislation to this effect within the timeframe recommended by the commission. Our aim is to introduce the minimum wage in a manner which ensures that there will be no adverse impact on the economy or on employment and which ensures that Ireland can maintain its competitive position with the agreement of the Government.</P>
      <P>I established an interdepartmental group of officials whose terms of reference are to assist in formulating proposals and a plan of action to ensure this can be achieved and to report to me and the Government as early as possible.  The group commenced work in early April and has considered a broad range of issues, many of them very complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One the issues which will now have to be addressed by the group is the likely effects of the proposed UK minimum wage on employment and competitiveness including its impact on small firms.  The UK Low Pay Commission report was published on 18 June and recommended a rate of <Col N="443" /> Stg£3.70 an hour in June 2000, with an initial rate of Stg£3.60 an hour in April 1999.  The National Minimum Wage Commission's report had itself recommended that the initial rate for a minimum wage should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness and this must have regard to the impact of the proposed UK minimum wage rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government indicated that it is considering a rate of £4.40 which is higher than the proposed UK rate of Stg£3.60. I understand that the UK rate will be phased on an age basis. It is important for manufacturing companies that the Government indicates the rate exactly.  The advice of the interdepartmental group will be very important.  Employers are entitled to know what the rate will be.  As we speak, employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy we are not debating the issue.  Have you a supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Employers are having extreme difficulties at present due to uncertainty about the Irish rate, particularly given that the rate has been set in the UK.  Will the Minister give an indication of the timeframe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission recommended that the minimum wage should be introduced when Partnership 2000 reaches its end, which is about April 2000.  It recommended different rates for people in training to the effect that someone in training for the first three years will get 70, 80 and 90 per cent of the minimum rate respectively. At current exchange rate values there is not a great difference between Stg£3.70 and £4.40. However, we cannot assume that the present exchange rates will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is to introduce a minimum wage to protect vulnerable workers.  One of the employers' major complaints at present is that they cannot get workers, particularly for unskilled jobs at more than £5 per hour in certain parts of the country.  We have to remain competitive if we are to attract investment, create employment and encourage growth and sustainability of the current level of jobs in this economy.  The working group of civil servants cuts across a number of different departments.  The idea is to put in place recommendations and proposals on how this could be implemented.  My idea is that next year, or maybe during autumn this year if it is drafted, we will bring in enabling legislation which will be framework legislation.  Then the wage will have to be introduced sector by sector by way of ministerial order.  In the context of the forthcoming budget, the whole issue of tax and PRSI and how it impacts on employment will have to be considered. Of £4.40 an hour at the moment, the State takes about 40p an hour in either tax or PRSI.  If we want to ensure we do not adversely affect competitiveness, we will have to look at the <Col N="444" /> issue of tax and welfare as well in the context of a minimum wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really told us the answer to one of the questions in that group.  What are the terms of reference of her interdepartmental group?  Many people would be of the opinion that what the Minister is doing is kicking the ball as far as possible into touch on this issue for the duration of this Government and that we will see no action on a key promise the Minister made before June last year, on which she may now be effectively reneging.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the problem of wage inflation, but is it not true that the commission found various places of employment, shops, not too far from here, offering £1.20 or £1.50 an hour &mdash; a disgraceful, outrageous wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to ensure that a minimum wage is also a competitive wage, and it can be.  That depends on how it is implemented. I brought a memorandum to Government suggesting that we establish a working group consisting of people from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health &mdash; because many of the people who will be affected by this are employees of the Department of Health &mdash; my own Department and a number of other Departments. Their task is to advise the Government on how to introduce a minimum wage to ensure that it does not adversely affect competitiveness.  That is what the commission suggested.  We will introduce it.  I cannot say that it will be introduced for every sector on day one.  It would be dishonest of me to say that because I will not introduce it where it will close down some operation or some sector.  We have to be conscious of that and we have to do it in a way that is sensible and sensitive. We can do that.  The idea is to have a working group in place so that by the time we come to negotiate a successor to Partnership 2000 we will have the operational arrangements ready.  It will be negotiated with the social partners.  I gave that commitment.  I intend to engage with them in the next couple of weeks when the Dáil goes into recess.  We have arranged a number of meetings with all of the social partners on this issue.  I know there is concern in the Small Firms' Association, ISME and organisations representing the small to medium-sized employers, but their concerns can be very much taken on board and this can be done sensitively.  For the first three years in many areas of employment a person will probably be in training and on rates of 70 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that her discovery of the sectoral approach is a backing off from her position when she rushed out a report in the dead of the night?  I am referring to the report that had a cover similar to that of the first Beatles LP where the typographical errors and so on were not corrected.  She fulsomely promised to implement that proposal.  There was no equivocation <Col N="445" /> and no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.  Is the Minister now backing off that?</P>
      <P>Is the preoccupation of the Minister's officials, to whom she refers in terms of this internal committee, with second guessing the commission rather than working out ways of implementing the commitment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and outline the Government's response.  The Government is committed to introducing a national hourly minimum wage of £4.40 per hour when Partnership 2000 runs out around April 2000.  As the commission said &mdash; and we accepted the commission's findings &mdash; it should be done in consultation as a successor to Partnership 2000 in a way that does not adversely affect any particular sector.  Deputy Rabbitte seemed to suggest it would be introduced everywhere on day one, regardless of the impact, but that was never the case.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Perry.  Our main concern must be to get more people back into work.  Clearly tax, PRSI and welfare payments must be integrated because we must ensure that we make it as attractive as possible for people to take up employment.  These issues impact in particular on people on low pay moving from welfare to work.  The Deputy can be assured, in the context of the coming budget and the remaining three budgets of this Government, that we will continue to reform the income tax system, as resources permit, with a view to giving more money back to PAYE workers in particular.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: The Minister is arguing for a minimum wage in a way that undermines the concept.  She warns of wage inflation threatening the economic boom.  Presumably the Minister is talking about anything over £4.40 per hour.  Is the Minister saying, therefore, that the economic boom is based on poverty wages and that that is justified?  Will she not agree that £4.40 an hour in the year 2000, which is only two years from now and we do not know what inflation will be in the interim, would be a pitiful wage to expect anybody to live on, particularly in view of the cost of housing?  A person earning £4.40 per hour would not get a mortgage to buy the front door let alone a home.  How can the Minister possibly say she is prepared to legislate for exceptions, that people would not be on £4.40 per <Col N="447" /> hour?  Will she agree that £6 per hour would go some way towards providing a decent wage?  I ask the Minister not to be influenced by the Fine Gael argument that tax concessions should be used as a substitute for employers coughing up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Minister assure the House that she will not be influenced by the miserly proposal of £3.60 emanating from Britain &mdash; I understand that figure has been leaked &mdash; which is an insult to the lower paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins might be surprised to hear me say that I agree with much of what he said.  I would like people to get £10 per hour if it was a competitive wage but our rates must be competitive.  We do not want to put people out of work.  Deputy Rabbitte suggested I was backtracking but as he knows the commission took into account that in some sectors people are paid a combination of hourly rates and tips, for example.  All of these aspects will have to be taken into account when calculating the hourly rate.  There are complex issues involved here and we must ensure we do this in a way that does not put anyone out of business and, in particular, does not increase the capacity of the black economy. I believe we can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two employers on the commission &mdash; not representing IBEC or any employer organisation &mdash; one from the hotel and catering industry and another from the food sector.  Both of them enthusiastically signed on for this and told me that one of the major difficulties they face is to get people to work for rates even higher than £4.40 per hour.  With negotiation and a commitment from the trade union movement, I believe they will not look for any relativity impact because this proposal will cost approximately £800 million per year.  We cannot allow a situation to develop where everybody who gets a wage level relative to the lowest will want a similar increase to keep the margin.  We currently have about 18 different JLC agreements covering more than 100,000 workers, many of which relate to each other.  If we introduce a minimum rate of £4.40 we must ensure that everybody whose rate is currently calculated in relation to the minimum does not seek to get the margin they currently have.  If that were the case it would cause wage inflation.  The purpose of the interdepartmental group is to examine all of these issues and advise the Government and the Minister on the best way <Col N="448" /> forward.  That seems to be by way of ministerial order, sector by sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very confused.  Like Delaney's donkey, the Minister seems to want to go a bit of the road with everybody.  Will the Minister confirm that in answering the question on the radio when she announced this report she said that she accepted the rate of £4.40?  Will she tell the House the exact terms of reference of the interdepartmental group and outline the discussions with the social partners?  Is it automatic that there will not be a rate lower than £4.40 or the equivalent in the year 2000 and is it open to the interdepartmental group to recommend a higher rate?  The Minister has not clarified the parameters in regard to the interdepartmental group.  If it is trying to implement the commission's report, is it on the basis of £4.40 per hour with allowances made for people under a certain age and those undergoing training for three years who get between 75 per cent and 90 per cent?  Is the interdepartmental group working on a rate of £4.40 or is the Minister trying to indicate to the business sector, which is concerned about a rate of £4.40, that this matter will be left up in the air in the hope that they will be nice to her while also keeping the trade unions happy?  Will the Minister clarify her position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is along the same lines.  I admire the Minister's skill but not her consistency. We have learned, by skilful drip-feed today, a number of new terms &mdash; sectoral, tips, inflation and relativity.  Is it not the case that if the Minister is waiting for somebody to give her a commitment on relativity, the people on low wages will be waiting forever for a minimum wage?  Whatever she might achieve in practice, she will not get that commitment.  Is it not the case that if tips in the non-unionised catering industry were to be taken into account it would undermine the purpose of a national minimum wage?  Tips always went into a separate fund and were distributed, in reasonably good employments, to workers.  The Minister is now taking that into the calculation in terms of setting the minimum rate.  It appears the Minister is committing herself to sectoral implementation so that perhaps the lowest paid areas will be the ones that suffer.  Is it not the case that there will be no difficulty in implementing this in respect of those already bordering on the Minister's minimum target but that there will be difficulty in cases where they are a long way short of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether the task she has given to the officials in her Department working on this committee is to begin drafting legislation on how to implement the commission's report?  Is that the riding instructions they have received or are stories about them second guessing the commission <Col N="449" /> correct?  I do not believe all the stories I hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff have been asked to draft the legislation and, as I said on many occasions, it will be enabling legislation.  Deputy Rabbitte said I am introducing new concepts, but that is not the case.  I am implementing the commission's report.  Remuneration for different sectors of workers is calculated in various ways.  In other countries where minimum wage legislation exists that is taken into account.  There are agreements between workers and employers at firm level on how people are remunerated.  It is not as simple as introducing a law to the effect that everybody receives at least £4.40. The minimum wage will be £4.40 and we must get a commitment from the unions that there will be no relativity impact. That commitment has already been given forcefully to the commission and the Government wants to get that commitment.</P>
      <P>A wage agreement negotiated by a previous Government will begin to run out in April 2000 and we will not upset that arrangement because employers and workers are entitled to expect, when wage agreements are entered into between the social partners and Government, that they will be honoured in full.  This one will be honoured in full and that is why we will begin to introduce the national minimum wage in the context of the successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>The commitment is to introduce a national hourly minimum wage of £4.40, beginning in April 2000, as recommended by the commission. There may be individual firms or sectors that might, for particular reasons, require extra months for implementation.  I am not talking about years, cop-outs or exemptions, I am talking about introducing this measure in a way that is fair and practical, does not cost employment and does not lead to increases in the black economy. We can achieve all those things, as was done in the United States and many other countries where there is a minimum wage.  The system operates effectively on a sector by sector approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enabling legislation will be published later this year or next year and will be ready to be implemented.  The group of officials chaired by my Department will meet to advise the Government on the complex issues referred to by the commission in regard to the minimum wage.  I have not withdrawn the commitment I gave after the commission's report was published.  I have had long, argumentative discussions with employer organisations about this issue and I remain determined to introduce it, but we must be sensible on how we do that.  It may take a little more time for one or two sectors that will be vulnerable, particularly in the context of EMU coming onstream from 1 January, but most Deputies will not want anything to happen that might upset arrangements that have been made at local level between firms and their employees. <Col N="450" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 27, 75 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>There are clear indications in the European Commission's recent Structural Funds proposals that a progressive reduction in the level of EU aid to Ireland after 1999 is to be expected. However, the actual amount of funding available will not be known until the new Structural Funds regulations have been adopted and Ireland's national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 has been negotiated with the European Commission.  It is anticipated that the new regulations will be adopted in early to mid-1999 and negotiations on the national development plan will follow.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance, in consultation with all concerned parties, including my Department, initiated preparations on the next national development plan which will set out Ireland's key priorities for the post-1999 period.  The plan will require approval by Government in due course.</P>
      <P>The impact of a cut in Structural Funds on the services provided by FÁS will depend on the level of structural funding available, the extent of other priorities requiring support, the levels of training and related services required by the labour market and the need to reduce unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister is working in a vacuum at present and does not know how <Col N="451" /> much she will be allowed spend on FÁS training services, has the Government, particularly the Department of Finance, had a discussion on how the shortfall, if any, will be made up and if there will be cuts in any other area?  Given the new structural plan for the year 2000-06, decisions will have to be made this year rather than when the hammer falls next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no discussion in Government on this issue, but Departments have submitted their proposals to the Department of Finance and it will bring proposals on the national plan before the Government.  The Government will be keen to ensure there is an employment focus to any moneys available.  If cuts are made, hopefully they will not affect employability, training or moving people from welfare into work.</P>
      <P>Of FÁS's current budget of more than £400 million per year, about £74 million comes from the European Social Fund and about £2.5 million from the Regional Fund.  Although that is a substantial amount of money, it is by no means the total FÁS budget.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will endeavour to ensure moneys are available for training and to help people to move from welfare into work, and that will be the focus.  There has not been a discussion. Plans have been exchanged and negotiations will follow in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the prediction that there will be a surplus of £1 billion this year?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has said he will use that money to reduce the national debt.  A report on Irish investment and infrastructural needs was published today, but with the fall-off in Structural Funds consideration must be given to capital development in the years ahead.  With the national debt soaring to about $75 billion, many people wonder whether it would be better to refocus some of the surplus moneys on high quality training to continue the efforts made by FÁS and other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case for reducing the national debt &mdash; if we cannot reduce the burden of debt at a boom time, when will one ever put money aside to do so &mdash; or spending the money on capital projects and alleviating the infrastructural deficit.  I would be very keen to ensure we do not become involved in current spending which has the potential to cause damage in the economy.  We must maintain the tight spending targets we set.  Cases can be made for more spending in many areas and it is always a question of priorities and choices, but the first priority must be prudent management of our economic affairs.  Otherwise the present boom will not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the changes that will occur at EU level because of Ireland's wealth, which has <Col N="452" /> increased from <i>per capita</i> income of 75 per cent of EU average eight years ago to more than 100 per cent now, and enlargement, with poorer regions joining the EU, we will receive less money.  The issue will be to ensure we spend the money wisely and that we have certain priorities such as employability and training.  Many of the deficits that will exist after the EU Structural Funds are agreed when we have less money can be taken up by the private sector.  There is huge capacity in the private sector to undertake projects on a partnership basis with the State, or in some cases on its own.  The Government is exploring options in that regard to ensure the infrastructural gaps that need to be rectified, particularly for an exporting economy, are not neglected.</P>
    <P>We must ensure we do not waste the surplus that will be available this year, which some outside forecasters say will be as high as £1 billion. We must prudently manage that revenue either by reducing the debt or using it for capital projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said we will receive less Structural Funds this year.  In terms of securing the maximum Structural Funds for the period 1999-2006, is the Minister aware the 13 counties, including western counties, Border counties and midland counties, have a GDP of 68 per cent and, therefore, qualify for maximum Objective One status?  Does the Minister intend to meet the commitment in the programme for Government that Objective One status will be sought in the post-1999 period for the west, Border counties and other regions which suffer from population decline?  Will the Minister live up to that commitment to ensure we receive maximum funding by applying for Objective One status for areas which qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that we will receive less money this year; we will receive similar funding until 2001.  We are talking about after that period.  We have not decided yet whether we will hold out for Objective One status for most of the country or have it in transition between then and 2006 or go for Objective One status for certain regions.</P>

      <P>The idea is to pick specific regions and apply for Objective One status for them.  The Government has not finalised its view on this issue.  We want to maximise what we can get for the entire country.  Within that, there must be priorities on where the money is spent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have noticed that many of the new projects announced over the past number of months have been for regional locations and that will continue to be the policy.  More grant-aid is available even under existing policies for regions such as the west and the more peripheral regions. This is done to try to encourage greater investment in those regions.  The west of Ireland is very high on the agenda and I am very sympathetic to its needs.</P>

      <P>This does not just involve the issue of Objective One status.  Even the new regional aid guidelines which will apply &mdash; they will be finalised with the Commission shortly &mdash; will ensure that there is a bias in favour of particular locations for grant-aid projects.  Almost double the grant-aid will be available for regions such as Roscommon or Galway as opposed to urban regions, particularly the larger cities such as Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.  It is beginning to happen and we will see a greater emphasis on the regions as a result of these policy changes.</P>

      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group was established, under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Collins, by my predecessor with the following terms of reference: to review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the Competition Act, 1991, and in particular, section 4(2) of that Act, and appropriate structures for implementation of the above legislation.</P>
      <P>I informed the House on 6 November 1997 that I had asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry in regard to the regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership.  The work of the review group is complex and wideranging and is making steady progress.  I am hopeful that it will report to me later this year.  I do not wish to anticipate the findings of the report and will, therefore, wait until I have considered the report's recommendations before deciding what legislation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the extent of the concentration of ownership in the media?  Does she consider an abuse of that dominant position took place in a recent controversy in this House about which I do not want to elaborate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the concentration of media.  There is no doubt there is one major player and I was not happy with some of what I saw recently.  I read the Deputy's article in <i>Magill</i> on my way back from the United States last week and he made some valid points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister's taste in literature and appreciate her remarks.  It is eight months since she told the House she had charged the review group with bringing forward advice on the implementation of these recommendations <Col N="455" /> and a great deal of time has elapsed. There are critical issues in terms of diversity and plurality in coverage of public affairs and so on. Is it not urgent that this should be addressed?  She said the group will report to her before the end of the year, which is 13 or 14 months after it was charged to do so.  Is that not an unconscionably long time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I had the report earlier and I agree with the Deputy.  I am concerned about the dominant position, particularly in the media, where there is a need for diversity and plurality. One of the hallmarks of democracy is having a free press and competition in the media and one must also be concerned about cross media ownership. I wish the group would report sooner, but I understand from my officials that it will report after the summer.  Hopefully when I receive the report we will be in a position to bring forward amending legislation.  That is my intention.  I looked at this issue before referring the matter, as did my predecessor.  I looked at the Commission on the Newspaper Industry report and many issues were dealt with such as low cost selling, defamation and ownership and dominance. Many of these issues were examined.  Some are not easy to act on because of difficulties they pose, but ownership and diversity is an area where we can move forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that it is taking so long for the group to report back?  I have tabled questions consistently since she set this task for this group and she has not been able to take any action.  Is she willing to adopt the procedure forced on her because of the threat of legal action where she introduced minor amendments to the copyright legislation prior to introducing the substantive Bill?  Are there elements of the commission's report that she could implement prior to receiving the report of the review group? Will she consider looking again at the recommendations of the commission to see what elements she could introduce in smaller Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Kitt, has worked extremely hard on the copyright legislation since he took office.  It is major legislation given that the law has not been updated since the 1960s and one section of the Department has worked constantly on it for a long time.  It is because of complaints at international level that we have to move forward and I accept that.  We had to go into fast track and get outside help which has been very useful.  It will be two years in September since my predecessor referred many of these issues to the mergers review group. It is a long time and they are very busy people.  It is a good group of people and perhaps contact can be made with them so that they could make recommendations in certain areas in advance of their overall report.  That is my intention.  I do not like interfering with groups that have been <Col N="456" /> established by telling them what to do, but it would be helpful to me if we could see their recommendations on this specific issue sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the Minister and Michael McDowell were very vocal and at times vehement that this issue be addressed a number of years ago when in Opposition.  She was also vocal in regard to semi-State companies and the commercial State sector in which the Government is opening up competition.  We have heard the mantra and demands for competition in the semi-State sector in telecommunications, air travel and so forth.  This is a double standard.  The Minister crossed to the far side of the House and suddenly ran away from competition in one of the most valuable areas of our culture, namely, newspapers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan is making a Second Stage speech.  A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept Deputy Michael D. Higgins's Bill at least as a first step towards bringing about real competition in the media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a simple issue.  One has to examine the question of dominance, ownership, cross-subsidisation and below cost selling which is not easy to establish when one is dealing with economies of scale and publications from other jurisdictions.  A wide basket of issues has to be addressed.  Having read the commission's report and met a number of groups which have concerns from different perspectives in relation to these issues, I considered it was better to give it to the expert group since we are looking at the whole issue of mergers and competition legislation in general.  I want to await its recommendations before advancing in this area.  It is better to get it right rather than rush legislation.  I do not regard this as an emergency.  When it comes to issues involving the media, we have to talk about it in its broadest sense, not only the print media but all forms of media to ensure that as far as possible there is competition and diversity. Something that is extremely important in a healthy democracy should be preserved and enhanced as much as possible and the legislation should facilitate rather than hinder that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance about promised legislation.  I presume the major player to whom she is referring is a former rugby player.  Will the promised legislation ensure that the media and newspapers cannot use front and middle-page editorials to attack Members for statements made in the House, a gross abuse of the position of the media?  Will the Minister's proposed legislation control that type of activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned copyright. <Col N="457" /> Is the Minister aware that the name, Enterprise Ireland, is registered and patented by the small firms?  Given that the name is associated with small companies and that Enterprise Ireland is geared towards Irish companies will there be a conflict of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister referred to the media being broader than newspapers, I presume she is referring to the prospect &mdash; and to the fact that it has already happened in some areas &mdash; of the same source of dominant ownership going into other areas of media, electronic and otherwise? Is she saying specifically that in any prospective legislation that is likely to be addressed? What is her view on the regional argument, in other words the argument advanced that we are in a somewhat peculiar and unique situation in Ireland, given the extent of penetration by English language newspapers from outside this jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McCormack, I am not speaking about any particular individual. I am not saying somebody will be prevented by legislation from criticising anyone.  That would not be healthy, what we want is freedom, choice and diversity and editorial freedom in particular. In relation to Deputy Rabbitte's comments, I am speaking about the wider issues.  I do not know how retrospective it can be.  People have been given certain assurances and there are legal entitlements that flow from that.  That is the reason that dealing with this issue is complex. Clearly, somebody who has ownership of a vehicle which has the capacity to make programmes, inform, educate, entertain and so on has a dominant position.  We need competition throughout the economy.  Competition is good for the economy.  Competition has brought about change faster than anything else.  It gives consumers greater choice and often better quality at lower prices.  We cannot be isolationist in the way we view competition.  It has to be thorough and we must have it in as many sectors as possible. The Government has an unprecedented record so far in relation to competition issues and agreeing to dispose of some State companies or interest in State companies with a view to encouraging competition, particularly in the area of telecommunications. We cannot confine the issue of competition to some sectors, we have got to ensure every sector is capable of being competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of what we referred to the mergers review group, I hope it will examine this issue in the broadest possible manner with a view to making recommendations.  I hope we can have those recommendations as quickly as possible as legislation may be required, either specialist legislation for this sector alone or more comprehensive legislation to deal with the wider issues involved in competition and mergers legislation. <Col N="458" /></P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>her views on whether the vast majority of the new job announcements by foreign multinationals are either extensions to existing plants or are locating in existing vacant advance factory space; and the way in which she proposes to achieve new job opportunities in areas where the IDA has a land bank but where no vacant factory space exists.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15772/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the January 1997-June 1998 period, IDA Ireland announced details of 125 investment projects from overseas companies.  Of these, 72 were new greenfield investments involving the announcement of 19,199 new jobs and 53 were expansions of existing overseas companies involving the announcement of 9,041 new jobs.</P>
      <P>The provision of suitable sites for industrial development is an important element of the overall strategy to promote enterprise and job creation and to this end the IDA acquires or retains suitable land in locations throughout the country which are attractive to foreign investors or which can be made to be attractive to them.  The IDA works closely with the local authorities and the private sector to ensure that a selection of advance factories is available on a phased basis in suitable locations in different parts of the country for both existing and new clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said 72 of the investment projects are new greenfield investments.  I suspect many of those are for existing vacant advance factories.  The problem which is prevalent in my constituency concerns IDA land banks on which no development whatever has taken place over many years.  In the context of such land banks where there has been virtually no activity, will Enterprise Ireland consider revisiting the policy of constructing advance factories so that these areas can get on the playing pitch and compete for inward investment?  Without an advance factory space these areas will not be on the circuit to be visited by companies seeking to establish.</P>

      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The job announcements in the past 12 months were either extensions to existing plants or plants moving into existing vacant factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a policy in the 1970s and the 1980s whereby the IDA acquired land and built advance factories.  While it had some success it tied down a good deal of taxpayers' money in buildings and land which lay idle for many years.  The policy now is to dispose, in so far as the IDA can, of its land bank and any vacant factory space.  Each year, under the provisions of the Finance Act, about six BES-funded <Col N="459" /> advance factories are provided &mdash; four for IDA-Forbairt companies, one for Údarás and one for Shannon Development, if I understand it correctly. They tend to be small projects.  The large greenfield projects tend to go into an existing site left vacant, such as Seagate in Clonmel which is an attractive facility.  Advance factories suit smaller projects.  Two weeks ago we announced a project for the advance factory provided in Carlow. It is also possible for the private sector to provide advance factories and if that is done in consultation with the IDA the agency undertakes to promote those factories.  That programme has been successful and there may be possibilities in the area mentioned by Deputy Creed.</P>
      <P>While the Government and the IDA has had good success in encouraging projects to locate outside the main cities, it is the larger towns close to cities which are attractive.  Many of the industries now located in Ireland are knowledge-based, require workers with a high level of skill, and want to be connected to third level institutions.  It remains difficult to get substantial investment for smaller towns in peripheral regions.  That is not to say we do not try hard to put in place a grant aid package which makes them attractive, but it is still relatively difficult notwithstanding the number of new investments coming into the country.  It is a case of horses for courses &mdash; only smaller enterprises will locate in smaller towns and rural areas with a small population base within ten to 15 miles of an investment location. The advance factory programme provided by the IDA and other agencies, together with the private sector programmes, might solve in the short term the problems highlighted by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the reply by the Minister for Finance to a parliamentary question from me about Sligo enterprise park? The board of the park has been shocked by the reply, because it had a 40 acre land bank and assumed it had huge tax advantages.  The EU Commission sought detailed information on the new tax relief for regional airports and enterprise areas provided in the 1997 Act, on foot of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and following the Commission's investigation it became apparent that the park qualified only for developer capital allowance but not for owner-occupier or double rent allowance.

The designations announced by the previous Government were not cleared with the EU and because of the implication that they might be &ldquo;state aid&rdquo; they all must be so cleared, and I can assure the Deputy this is not a foregone conclusion.  In so far as we can we will encourage, either through the tax system or through a grant aid package to industry, the location of investment in regions such as those he mentions, and that will continue to be Government policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan, there are four Deputies offering and in fairness to them I appeal to all Deputies to ask a question.  The purpose of Question Time is to elicit information from the Minister, not to make statements.  Deputies should ask questions to ensure they get as much information as possible from whichever Minister is answering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA has sold its land bank around factories which have closed, such as ACCO, Applied Magnetics and GE.  How does the Minister propose to reintroduce high-tech foreign industry into these places when the land bank is no longer there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The State does not have to acquire land to encourage investment in a location.  If a private company owns land or factory facilities it is always keen to dispose of it as quickly as possible &mdash; it does not want idle assets on its balance sheet.  In recent closures the private sector has acted rapidly and in the next few weeks the Deputy will see that several facilities have been sold, with IDA assistance, to other inward investors. It is a question of being flexible.  The IDA has a great deal of land and in South County Dublin, for example, it is trying in conjunction with the county council to promote private and public sector land.  It has been successful in getting a number of new projects onto private sector land at Citywest; there is also public sector land owned by the local authority at Kilmahuddrick, Clondalkin.  I cannot say that one set of land is higher than the other on the priority list &mdash; all land banks of that kind, regardless of their ownership, are promoted vigorously by the IDA to potential investors and ultimately it is the investors who decide what is the ideal location for their investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does shortage of factory space or a diminishing land bank rank in terms of the factors constraining inward investment, as compared to skills shortages, for instance?  How <Col N="461" /> acute is the problem or do we still have a competitive advantage in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The skills shortage was becoming acute and the £250 million education technology fund will help to relieve that but it will take time because there is still a lot of pressure, particularly for engineers.  Many of the smaller Irish companies are finding it difficult to hold staff because they are finding opportunities in larger international companies more attractive.  One complaint I hear is that companies cannot find workers, and even at a higher skill level they find it difficult to hold workers.  There has been much inflation in some sectors because of the demand for particular skills and to some extent we are becoming the victims of our success.</P>
      <P>That is a bigger factor than the availability of factory space or land banks &mdash; that becomes an issue when a company is looking at one area as opposed to another.  If they want to start up quickly &mdash;&ldquo;ramp up&rdquo;, as the Americans call it &mdash; they will be more attracted to a location if it has a suitable facility.  That is why the points made by Deputy Creed are valid &mdash; the small company we recently attracted to Carlow might have gone elsewhere had there not been a facility available, and in towns of the size of Carlow and Killarney, that can be an attraction.  On the other hand, some places have facilities but we cannot get people to fill the space.  The ideal is to have the facility in the correct place but it is not always possible to get that right.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that we are getting the projects for Ireland and we should try to achieve the widest possible dispersal of those projects, particularly to regions outside Dublin, and that is Government policy.  For example, 4,500 jobs for Cork were announced in the past 12 months, which is the highest number ever &mdash; equivalent to the number of jobs announced for Dublin &mdash; and is a large proportion of the overall investment. We will continue to try to locate projects around the regions and as far from the cities as possible, if we can, so that people have a reason to live in more peripheral areas, and schools and other facilities have the possibility to be sustained by a local population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Carlow is an attractive location because of its third level college, the reputation the area has gained as a result of the good experience of multinational companies located there and its proximity to Dublin.  These positive factors continue to make Carlow an attractive destination for investors.</P>
      <P>A new project for Roscommon was announced recently.  There is always competition between local companies who want to use facilities as warehouses or distribution centres and agencies who wish to install more sustainable projects in those buildings.  We must maximise possibilities for idle space in Roscommon, Galway or other areas.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of site visits to the Creagh-Ballinasloe area recently.  I am optimistic that we will get a suitable investor for the lands acquired there by the IDA.  That will be good news for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 19, 42, 43, 67 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report from the inquiry team into the dispute at Ryanair soon.  This is a complex and difficult dispute and thus the inquiry team needed some considerable time to examine the issues involved.  I propose to publish the report after consideration by the Government of its findings.  Until I receive the report, therefore, I do not propose to make any further comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;soon&ldquo;?  When the two people involved were asked by the Government to carry out this report, the matter was extremely urgent.  While we are waiting for the publication of this report, is the Minister aware there are ongoing problems in Ryanair?  We cannot tackle these until the report is published.  Is the Minister aware that more of the young people who were involved in the dispute have since been let go?  Is he having discussions with Ryanair while he is waiting for the report about the actions it is taking in response to the dispute?</P>

      <P>Is the value of this exercise being undermined by the manner in which it is being carried out?  Is that at the behest of the Minister and his Department or is it because the two people appointed are finding it difficult to do the job?  Is it not the case that this formula was devised as the result of the intervention of the Taoiseach?  The chief executive of that company is now thumbing his nose at the office at the Taoiseach. At the rate at which those two people are coming up with a formula, none of the baggage handlers will be left in Ryanair by the time they make their proposals.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate to bring forward fundamental legislation on trade union recognition, to which the Minister alluded during the debate on the Bill I introduced recently.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will be completed in a matter of weeks.  This dispute was a complex one. <Col N="464" /> All industrial disputes are unpleasant.  As someone who was close to this dispute, as were the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, it was an unsavoury one.  The intervention of the Taoiseach was helpful, as was the involvement of the social partners. No one underestimates the fact that it was a significant dispute.</P>
      <P>The investigation concerns many parties apart from those directly involved in the dispute, such as Aer Rianta and other airlines.  The inquiry team of Mr. Dan McAuley and Mr. Philip Flynn have also had to deal with a large volume of written submissions and documentation.  I refute Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion that there is any procrastination on the part of the people involved, who are highly skilled.  We will have the report in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Broughan's question on legislation, I hope the high level group on trade union recognition will be reconvened soon.  This matter will have to be discussed with the social partners.  We had an extensive debate in the House on this issue.  The challenge is how to modernise voluntarism in a way which reflects the concerns of the trade union movement and addresses the need to avoid damage to investment in enterprise and jobs.</P>
      <P>Many questions have been put to the Tánaiste on foreign investment and I know the position of the Fine Gael Party and its recognition of that issue.  It is important that the high level group on trade union recognition meet as soon as possible to deal with the broader issue to which Deputy Broughan referred.</P>

      <P>This proposal concerns investor compensation.  There are a number of investors in Irish Life who are entitled to compensation because of the practise of churning that apparently has been used legally by that company.  I know the Tánaiste would wish to make it clear that legislation will be introduced to ban this practice and, obviously, this should be dealt with in the context of compensating those who have been the victims of it.  May I have an assurance from her on this point before we agree to limit the time for dealing with this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who has responsibility for insurance matters in the Department of Enterprise, Trade, and Employment has met representatives of the company. Two officials of the Department went to the company's offices on Friday, yesterday and again today with a view to overseeing the remedy Irish Life intends to put in place to make restitution to the affected investors.  If extra powers are required, they will be used.  I have not had an opportunity to study the legislation yet but, if necessary, we will correct any anomalies or deficiencies that exist in insurance legislation.  We are determined to ensure the policy holders affected by the decisions taken by the sales staff are fully compensated as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree it would be better not to conclude this investor compensation legislation today in case we need to amend it to cover compensation to Irish Life investors who have been the victims of churning? <Col N="468" /> Does she agree we should not rush this legislation through today?  While I have no doubt about her good intentions in the matter, if the Dáil goes into recess it will not be possible to pass legislation on this matter.  Perhaps we should not conclude the legislation for another day or two so that any legislative powers that are needed to ban churning, to enforce compensation or to appoint inspectors to deal with the problem in Irish Life would have the necessary statutory authority from this House before it goes into recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton knows, the Investor Compensation Bill is required by virtue of an EU Directive.  If changes are required on foot of the matters to which he referred, amendment to the insurance Acts would be more appropriate. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will shortly introduce regulations that will lead to more transparency in respect of the rights of policy holders, the commission they are charged and so on.  This will not only improve the regulatory environment but lead to greater transparency so that people know exactly what they are paying for.  If legislation is required, it should involve the main insurance Acts which would necessitate separate legislation.</P>

      <P>I understand the Government has not completed its work on the Firearms Bill, yet it wants the Dáil to take it tomorrow.  Given the serious nature of firearms legislation, the Government's proposal to introduce a more favourable regime in terms of issuing firearms to visitors to this country than applies to people who live here and that such discrimination should be based on law if it is not to run contrary to the Constitution, what is the Government doing that it has not produced this legislation which it wants to debate in the House tomorrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We were promised at a Whips' meeting that we would be given a draft of this Bill at an early stage.  However, it has not yet seen the light of day.  We are expected to discuss this serious measure as if it is an emergency over the next two days.  I will oppose it being taken at all unless we receive the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste should be aware that there is great concern about this Bill.  The fact it has not been published yet makes it <Col N="471" /> extremely difficult, if not impossible, for us to debate it properly and to give it the attention it deserves.  I ask her to consider moving the debate until later tomorrow to give us an opportunity to examine the Bill's provisions and to deal with this extremely important measure in a way that is appropriate to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for the failure to produce the Bill.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been working on this over the weekend and I understand it will be ready later this evening.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to arrange for Opposition spokespersons to be briefed.  Deputy McManus made a valid suggestion. The Government would be prepared to discuss this Bill later tomorrow.  I regret that it has not been published yet, but Deputies will be able to see it later in the evening.  If the House is agreeable, we can discuss it later tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should remember the rod licence issue and the way things came unstuck.  It was rushed through this House and it was bad legislation.  It is not a good idea to rush legislation through the House, particularly legislation relating to firearms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the electoral boundaries will be known some time this week or next week and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has promised legislation on the direct election of county council chairpersons and mayors, will the Government ensure that this legislation is published soon so that we have it well in advance of the local elections next year?  I ask the Tánaiste to tell the House when the Bill will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the legislation is published as quickly as possible, but the Minister for the Environment and Local Government wants to wait for the report before he introduces the legislation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1998 copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 24th day of June, 1998.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The proposed regulations will be made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Acts, 1979 to 1996, and their purpose is to reduce the contribution by the farming community towards the cost of the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes by £2 million in a 12 month period.</P>
      <P>Diseases levies were introduced here in 1979 under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, to provide for the farming community to make a financial contribution towards the cost of the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  Under this Act a levy was imposed on all cattle slaughtered in the State, on live exports from the State and on each gallon of milk delivered for processing.</P>
      <P>The rates of levy were last adjusted from 1 April 1996 when they were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal slaughtered or exported live and from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon of milk delivered. That reduction resulted in a saving to farmers of £18 million in a 12 month period and was made in recognition of the additional cost to farmers who from that time were to pay private veterinary practitioners directly for the first TB and brucellosis test on their herd each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, access to European Union and Third Country markets is underpinned by our relatively high animal health status and freedom from major diseases and by our application of animal health rules provided for in EU legislation.  These factors will continue to be decisive in maintaining our access to markets as the animal health status is raised throughout the Union and elsewhere.  In the foregoing context, Ireland operates a number of measures aimed at preventing the introduction of animal diseases <Col N="478" /> and at controlling, reducing and eradicating diseases. The most important national animal disease programmes in terms of human, animal and financial considerations are the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  For trading purposes and to comply with EU legislative requirements, it continues to be necessary to operate annual programmes for both diseases which are costly to farmers and to taxpayers, while progress towards reduction and the eventual eradication of the residual levels remains difficult.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, the total expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes has exceeded £1 billion.  Since the disease levies were introduced in 1979, farmers have contributed about £315 million up to the end of 1997 while £28.7 million has been received from the EU Veterinary Fund.  While these are large sums of money, they should be seen against the value of our cattle, beef and dairy export trade.</P>
    <P>In 1997 farmers contributed some £10.6 million by way of levy to the £38.8 million operational costs of the bovine TB and brucellosis programmes.  The Exchequer carried the balance of the operational costs, that is, £28.2 million as well as the costs of salaries of administrative, veterinary, technical, laboratory and clerical staff.  The farming community is contributing a considerable amount of money towards the cost of the programme. It is estimated it contributes approximately £16 million per annum for private testing and £10 million by way of levy, making a total of £26 million.  The Exchequer contributes about £50 million.  It is an expensive scheme but it is important from the point of view of human health, customers worldwide, and access to EU and third country markets.  It is important, from the point of view of animal disease, that Ireland's status remains at its present high level.</P>
    <P>The proposed draft regulations to reduce the bovine diseases levies from 1 July 1998 to £2 per animal exported live or slaughtered and to 0.4p per gallon of milk delivered for processing should generate an aggregate amount of some £2 million savings to farmers in a one year period.  The proposed reductions are made against the background of the restructuring of many of the operational aspects of the brucellosis eradication scheme, which I have put in place in recent months.</P>
    <P>The incidence of TB has remained relatively unchanged over recent years.  However, and while the incidence of brucellosis in cattle had remained fairly stable over the years 1988 to 1995, the position began to deteriorate in 1996. This deterioration continued during 1997.  There are no definitive or clear-cut reasons for the increase in the disease levels; veterinary opinion is that changing farm practices allied to a degree of complacency on the part of some farmers in purchasing cattle and a susceptible cattle population are mainly responsible.  There is a need for <Col N="479" /> awareness of the problem.  It is a most difficult and severe problem for farmers whose herds are afflicted by this disease.  A great deal of discipline is required.</P>
    <P>To address this deterioration and after protracted discussions at the National Animal Health Forum, I introduced a range of additional initiatives early this year.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the initiatives include the following.  From 23 February 1998, all eligible animals being moved into or out of holdings &mdash; other than direct to a slaughter premises &mdash; must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement.  In addition, all bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test, and such cattle must be moved from the holding where tests were undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding.  A full round of blood testing of all eligible animals is being carried out in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements, including monthly milk ring testing.  A full round of blood testing of all eligible animals in the worst affected areas has been completed in the two month period, March-April 1998.  A range of operational-administrative measures were introduced aimed at improving the operation and delivery of the eradication measures, including an awareness campaign, increased epidemiology, early removal of reactors, improved monitoring and other operational measures.  A revamped compensation regime came into effect from 27 April 1998.</P>
    <P>These measures were additional to those introduced during 1997.  All parties represented at the NAHF accepted that these additional measures and initiatives were essential to address the deteriorating brucellosis situation and to protect our trading status in both livestock and livestock products.  While the &ldquo;one sale&rdquo; aspect is over and above the strict requirements of the EU regime, it is accepted as being essential if the brucellosis problem is to be turned around quickly.  These are rigorous regulations and they cause hardship to farmers.  The NAHF and I believe that doing the job quickly and achieving a rapid turnaround is the best way of addressing the matter.  In the negotiations, the farming bodies pressed strongly that my Department should bear the costs of the additional testing, which is estimated at about £4 million a year.  In the context of securing the full backing of the farming bodies for the initiatives under the brucellosis eradication scheme and, partially relieving farmers of the additional testing costs, it was agreed towards the end of April 1998 that the bovine diseases levies should be reduced by amounts yielding about £2 million per annum which equates with 50 per cent of the additional testing costs on farmers.  Necessary Government approval for this was secured on 9 June 1998 subject to obtaining necessary approval today from both Houses of the Oireachtas of the <Col N="480" /> motion before each House.  The reductions proposed will be effective from tomorrow, 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that the new requirements, particularly those relating to testing and the &ldquo;one sale&rdquo; regime, impose additional constraints on farmers and others.  At the same time, the farming and veterinary bodies and the representatives from my Department and the Department of Finance involved in the negotiations over an extended period in the latter part of 1997 and earlier this year accept the veterinary advice that the new measures and initiatives already outlined would be essential, together with the full use of current technology and good herd management practices to redress the brucellosis problem in cattle, safeguard animal and public health, and protect our trading position for livestock and livestock products.</P>
    <P>The additional testing regime resulted in a huge increase in the volume of blood samples received for testing in both the Cork laboratory and the Sligo laboratory.  For example, some 2.66 million blood samples were received in the Cork laboratory up to the end of last week this year compared with 1.6 million samples for the corresponding period in 1997.  Due to the increase in throughput in the Cork laboratory and some delays in recruiting staff, there were some delays earlier this year in processing results.  However, the position now is that, following initiatives taken by me, there are no arrears in the laboratory &mdash; the backlog was cleared over the June bank holiday weekend &mdash; and the processing of blood samples commences on the dates they are received in the laboratory.  The improving situation should be further underpinned by a number of other measures already in place or being introduced, including in particular, an inquiry desk, further e-mail facilities and the use of An Post's Swift Post system for delivery of test samples to the Cork laboratory.  The latter system includes a guaranteed delivery timescale as well as a tracking and tracing capability.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the staff under Dr. Heneghan in the Cork laboratory and the staff in the Sligo laboratory working unsocial hours, weekends and overtime, particularly over the June bank holiday weekend to clear up the backlog so they have a clear desk each morning.  This ensures there is a rapid turnaround and the shortest possible time elapses between taking the sample and returning the results.  I am confident the systems in place and the initiatives and measures I have taken enable the Cork laboratory to provide a satisfactory turnaround for the volume of blood which will now be received.  Some further steps are being taken to speed up deliveries.  I am confident no further delays will occur and that if they do they will be identified early and redressed rapidly. I will continue to keep the situation under very close review.</P>
    <P>The new regime has been in place since the end of February and I am satisfied with the level of co-operation as regards blood sampling.  There is <Col N="481" /> a very good awareness of the dangers of brucellosis. We have identified a higher number of new reactor herds to date by comparison with 1997.  However, this must be seen in the context of the additional testing undertaken and the locations in which a high percentage of blood samples have been taken given that the programme has focused on areas with the highest levels of disease.  At the same time, the figures give cause for concern and underpin this need for strict observance of, and compliance with, these new measures by all concerned.  If we persist with this programme, it will achieve the desired results.</P>
    <P>I recommend that these regulations be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed reductions in the animal disease levies which are being announced here today are minuscule when taken in the context of what farmers must pay for the TB and brucellosis test and the fact that the brucellosis pre-movement test must be paid for also. I am surprised at the small decrease in the levies, given what went before.  An average small farmer with 40 cattle in any part of the country must pay £110 for the annual round of TB testing, that is 40 cattle at £2 per head.  Assuming that half the herd are females, the farmer must pay an additional £1.50 per head.  In addition and as the Minister stated, every time a farmer sells a female animal, there must be a pre-movement test. Because many farmers do not have a large number of cattle, it is likely, even with a herd of 40 cattle, that the farmer would have two, three or five animals tested at a time.  In such instances the charges are much higher, between £5 and £7 per head.  The total bill comes to £160.  If the farmer can sell ten of the animals, he will gain £5 or 50p per animal as a result of these changes.  It will not pay him to lick a stamp.  The new tuberculosis testing system under which the farmer pays for the test took a heavy load off the Exchequer.  It was implicit at the time it was introduced that when the levies were tampered with something significant would be done.  A dairy farmer with a quota of 20,000 gallons will gain £20.</P>
      <P>There is an array of levies.  I had to pay no fewer than six levies in respect of an animal that I sold last week.  I had to pay a veterinary levy of £3.70; an insurance levy of £1.50; a Bord Bia levy of £1.50; an IFA levy of 0.1 per cent &mdash; 10p per £100 &mdash; a bovine disease levy of £2.50 &mdash; from today this will be reduced to £2 &mdash; and a special risk material levy of £3.  The total bill came to £12.52. It costs £10 on average to transport an animal to the factory.  Therefore, between testing and levies it costs between £25 and £30 to have an animal killed.  A levy of 69p is payable on every sheep.  I do not know how the Minister arrived at the figure of 50p but it is out of all proportion to what the Exchequer saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On brucellosis testing, successive Governments took the foot off the pedal.  I have often said that other than health problems inside the door <Col N="482" /> nothing affects farmers as much as brucellosis outside it.  It is a horrible disease.  I cannot understand why there is not a full round of milk testing &mdash; the milk ring test &mdash; on a continual basis.  I am informed that this has not happened in the past four to five years.  There are four or five black spots which, to coin a phrase, are rotten with brucellosis. Something has to be done about this.  I hope in time we will be able to move from a restrictive testing regime about which farmers are upset.</P>
    <P>On the blood testing déba cle, I join the Minister in congratulating staff in Cork and Sligo for delivering the goods.  Although the Department had known for a full six months that the pre-movement test was to be introduced, it failed to provide the necessary facilities.  It was only after several debates inside and outside the House that it dawned on it that there were insufficient staff in Cork.  It was not in order that farmers only had a few days in which to sell an animal tested for brucellosis.  I sound a note of caution.  During the high summer fewer samples are sent to the laboratory. On 1 September there will be a rebellion in farming circles if there is a recurrence.  This must not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation under the brucellosis and tuberculosis schemes, I appreciate the Department and ERAD have to be extremely careful in dealing with herds which have to be depopulated a second time.  There is bound to be suspicion that fair procedures were not followed on the first occasion.  I know of a farmer in the Minister's county who finds himself in this position. I have been led to believe that he has crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dotted every &ldquo;i&rdquo; but it appears that ERAD will not depopulate the herd on the same basis on this occasion.  Neighbouring farmers are at their wits' end as cattle are continuing to abort.  Why is the Department not depopulating the herd?</P>
    <P>I know of another farmer in County Galway who had his herd of 20-30 milch cows cleaned out earlier this year.  Due to a technicality concerning the number of gallons of milk supplied to the creamery he fell on the wrong side of the eligibility rules.  Three cows in high lactation had to be killed but this could not be taken into account. He would have qualified for an extra £100 for each animal.</P>
    <P>In transporting an animal to the factory, if one of the two yellow tags is lost, departmental staff are under instruction to turn the animal back.  If the remaining tag matches the cattle identity card, the blue card, and everything else is in order, I cannot understand why the animal is not killed. I would appreciate if the Minister could give a direction to his staff in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the accuracy of the brucellosis test.  For whatever reason, a number of animals that were tested for brucellosis and given the all clear, aborted a number of weeks later. When replying, will the Minister indicate whether this serious problem is widespread?</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer &mdash; I <Col N="483" /> brought it to the Minister's attention on previous occasions &mdash; involves animal health and issuing herd numbers.  As Members are aware, herd numbers are no more than a mechanism designed to control animal diseases.  In the past I was led to believe that there were four main criteria farmers had to meet to qualify for a herd number, namely, that they owned livestock, that they owned land or occupied it under long-term lease, that they had stock handling facilities &mdash; a cattle crush &mdash; and, most importantly, that there should never be intermixing of herds with those owned by neighbouring farmers, spouses, daughters or sons. However, it appears that this has been thrown out the window in respect of a number of categories of farmers.  For example, the rules which apply to most people in terms of granting a herd number do not apply to farmers and their wives who operate separate farming businesses.  The Minister will be aware that the Department's district inspectors ask at least 40 questions of these people which would not be put to ordinary farmers.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that there should be one rule for a certain category of farmers and a different rule for others.  Will the Minister indicate whether the regulation being considered by his Department in respect of the issuing of herd numbers applies to everyone or whether the Department or the European Union harbour greater suspicion of farmers whose spouses or offspring are also involved in farming?  This is an important matter and the Minister must clarify whether there are two rules or merely one.</P>
    <P>One of the criteria introduced in respect of payment of the top rate of compensation for brucellosis animals is that they should be retested when they are brought on to farms, a fact of which many farmers are unaware.  Will the Minister take action to publicise this requirement through local vets testing during the annual round, through the Department's local offices or by some other means?  If such action is not taken, farmers who may have infected their herds through the purchase of cows, which were not 30 day tested when brought on to their farms, will not receive the compensation to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward the reduction proposed in the regulations because it represents a step forward for agriculture.  Unfortunately, it represents only one step and there is a need for many more before the regulations meet the needs of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have been obliged to contend with successive levels of red tape.  Every action requires that a form be completed, a test taken <Col N="484" /> and a fee paid.  The regulations represent a new trust for farmers who have worked extremely hard to raise standards and improve practices. The TB eradication programme may not have rid the country of that disease but it has improved the safety of beef and meat in general.  If we continue to take small steps, the Department and the farming community will eventually be successful in eradicating TB.</P>
    <P>Farmers are now more aware of what is required to meet consumer demands and the regulations are a recognition of this.  Irish consumers demand quality and safe meat products. Increasingly, they ask questions regarding the content of food, its origin and its safety.  While farmers have been criticised in the past for their production practices, they have made significant headway in improving the quality of their produce.  Farmers must be commended for their co-operation with disease eradication programmes, angel dust bans and herd inspections. Many have incurred significant costs in complying with inspections and testing.</P>
    <P>The reduction of levies put forward in the regulations is important because it will contribute a raising of standards on farms.  However, this is only the first step in the complete eradication of the problems which gave rise to the regulations. We must continue to make provisions which will enhance agricultural practices and the standard of produce.  To this end I impress on the Minister for Agriculture and Food the importance attached to the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the need to make immediate provision to reintroduce it immediately.  The farming community is on tenterhooks while waiting to see if he is committed to the scheme's reintroduction.  It is time that full details of any plans to reintroduce it were announced.</P>
    <P>Farmers must also be provided with a more efficient service in respect of the speed at which they are provided with the results of blood tests from the Department of Agriculture and Food. They are interested in safety and quality but many are frustrated by the delays in the return of blood tests taken under the disease eradication scheme.  I call on the Minister to review the system of returning test results and to ensure that farmers are provided with those results as a matter of urgency.  The sale of stock and farm work are often adversely affected by the delays to which I refer.  Will the Minister and his Department investigate these important matters and liaise with the farming associations to reach an amicable agreement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of the reduction in costs for farmers, for whom the past 12 months have been difficult.  Compulsory blood testing for TB was introduced in 1954 and I am amazed by the amount of money which has been spent in that regard.  It is a national scandal that animal diseases have not been eradicated, particularly in an age when men have landed on the moon, heart bypass operations have become common <Col N="485" /> and computer technology and the Internet are a part of our daily lives.  Despite the amount of taxpayers' money used on disease eradication schemes, we do not appear to be any closer to resolving this problem.</P>
      <P>Everyone must support the Department of Agriculture and Food in respect of the measures it puts in place to deal with this problem.  Agriculture is a national industry and it has come under attack in recent years.  We must do everything in our power to improve the industry and provide it with assistance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement in respect of testing.  As Deputy Connaughton stated, farmers are obliged to pay a vets' levy, an insurance levy, a brucellosis levy, an IFA levy and special risk levy.  Members of the general public believe that farmers do not contribute to these schemes.  I am glad that a message will be sent from this House that farmers pay their fair share. I accept that taxpayers have been obliged to pay a large part of the cost in respect of this ongoing problem but agriculture is an important national industry and must be supported.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the system dispatching blood samples for testing in Cork?  The Minister and the Minister of State have done a great deal for that county in recent weeks but a number of farmers there are outraged by some of the decisions taken by them.  I do not intend to become involved in an argument about County Cork because I do not live there.  However, I am concerned that farmers in the west are obliged to wait between 21 to 23 days for the results of blood tests.  Would it be possible to establish a blood testing centre in County Mayo or would it be possible for farmers in the five western counties to use the existing centre in County Sligo?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to put a proposal to Cabinet that people in the western counties could go to Sligo rather than Cork.  Farmers were outraged at the length of time they had to wait for the blood tests to come back and some of them were delayed in selling cattle at the marts.  My proposal would provide an easy solution to the problem.  I hope the Minister could select a place in County Mayo and I will give him whatever assistance I can in that regard.  If not, Sligo would provide the answer.</P>
      <P>I had a telephone call from a farmer in County Mayo last night whose herd has been locked up. The greatest tragedy for any farmer is to find out that his herd has tested positive and has to be locked up.  This farmer had bought a lot of milk quota and he had built a slatted barn for which he did not get a grant, although he was obliged to build it.  He had intended to pay back his borrowings to the bank and the building society during the five months when milk yield is highest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the case of this young farmer with a young family whose wife will have to earn money to keep the bank at bay.  This man has worked hard to build up his farm and has sought no assistance from the State.  He did not get a grant under the control of farmyard pollution <Col N="486" /> scheme and he bought the extra milk quota.  I ask the Minister to try to assist this man in the difficult circumstances he faces.  He is afraid that he may have to sell his land to pay the banks.  We all know what vultures the banks can be.  One bank used have an advertisement using an umbrella which spoke about the good days. However, the banks take back the umbrella in the bad times.  I will write to the Minister on this case and I ask him and his officials to give it favourable consideration.  It involves a young man with a family who has built up his farm and, tragically, his herd has been struck with TB.</P>
    <P>Farmers have had a bad year and this measure will assist them in a small way.  It is not a major reduction but it is a step in the right direction.  I hope farmers will get good news at the end of the week with regard to the levies as they were outraged by the circumstances surrounding the tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>With this announcement the Minister is taking a step in the right direction towards dealing with the huge costs farmers have had to pay over the years with regard to the eradication of TB and brucellosis.  Farmers have had to face severe demands seeking to be rid of the scourge of TB and brucellosis.  Farmers face serious hardships in meeting the requirements of the animal diseases Acts.  They face great frustration when, having had clean herds for ten or 15 years, their herds are found to be infected with brucellosis and TB.</P>
      <P>There must be a method of combating the spread of these diseases.  For all the money that has been spent, the Department does not seem able to come up with a solution that will be of benefit to the farming community.  However, this measure may be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  The reduction announced is so small that it will have little or no effect on the hardships endured by the farming community.  The reduction will amount to a total of £5 per 40 head of cattle tested.  It is an insult to the intelligence of the agricultural community to offer such a small reduction.</P>
      <P>Once and for all the Minister should seek to give the farming community some relief from the strain under which it labours.  Farmers have survived a range of taxes in seeking to stave off these dreaded diseases.  The taxes to be paid on each animal slaughtered amount to about £13 per head.  Surely the time has come to get rid of these bovine diseases and to try to level the playing pitch for farmers.  The US and many European countries have eradicated these diseases over the past decade and cleared their herds.  However, for some unknown reason, they still break out in Ireland despite the action the Department has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> The owners of herds which are locked up are on the bread line.  I know farmers in my constituency who owe huge sums to banks, building societies and local authorities for loans they took out to make improvements to their farms.  I do not see why the Minister cannot grant a greater reduction.  Otherwise the farmers will not survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this reduction which follows the substantial reduction granted in 1996. Although it is small, any such reduction at a time of falling prices is welcome.  I wish to highlight the problem in my constituency with which the Minister's officials will be familiar.  I appeal to the Minister of State to designate north Kerry, Limerick, north Cork and south Tipperary as black spots, where something has to be done, because the initiatives introduced in February are not working.  I will give some statistics.  In 1994, four herds were depopulated in the north Kerry area; in 1997 this amounted to 45; and to date, 40 herds have been depopulated in north Kerry.  This is a problem of epidemic proportions which must be seriously addressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State came down and gave a commitment to put a special police force in place to chase up offenders.  I appeal to him to go back again to the constituency.  The affected herds had never before been affected.  The owners practised a very high standard of hygiene and animal husbandry and had not bought in.  They did everything right.  Nevertheless, their herds are being destroyed and their whole economic future is in doubt.  To illustrate the seriousness of the problem let me give the number of reactors removed from herds.  In 1994, 809 animals were removed, in 1997, 3,172 or more animals were removed, and there are 70 herds locked up in Kerry at the moment.  That is well ahead of last year's rate. The problem of brucellosis is not waning but increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the compensation scheme is very confusing and totally bureaucratic.  It is a year since I was in the Department of Agriculture, but people are totally confused.  They now have to fill in six forms.  It is impossible for ordinary farmers to come to terms with the bureaucracy, and this should be looked at very seriously.  In Kerry, people had to wait two months for the new forms, which they received in the past few days.  The regulations introduced last September were not publicised.  People who bought in extensively knew about the regulations. However, others, who were not buying in heifers or replacement cows, but who bought in a bull or, in some cases, two bulls, were not aware of the link between pre and post-movement testing and compensation.  Having bought in a bull who had been pre-movement tested but which they did not have post-movement tested, they lost thousands of pounds in compensation.  This is being examined at the moment.  I appeal to the Minister of State, the Minister and the officials to show some sympathy for this section of the farming population. <Col N="488" /> They are few in number, but if they are not granted some allowance they could suffer total economic ruin and may have to leave farming.</P>
    <P>Given the epidemic in Munster and the fact that there is no sign of it waning, perhaps the introduction of vaccine could be considered. Would that be totally out of the question?  Is it forbidden by EU regulation?  I think it is the only solution because we will have the same problem at the end of this year as we had at the end of last year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, went to Sligo yesterday to see the veterinary laboratory for himself.  He is the first Minister for Agriculture to have done so since a former Minister for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, went there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough just to keep the laboratory open.  It must be modernised, and I would like to see £150,000 or £200,000 being spent on it.  I agree with Deputy Ring that all cattle in the north-west should be tested there.  I would go further and say that cattle in the whole of Connacht-Ulster should be tested there because Sligo is the capital of the north-west. Deputy Ring mentioned that he would like to see the testing done in Mayo, but we should leave the laboratory in Sligo since it is there.</P>
      <P>Quite a lot of testing has been done in Sligo. In May, 12,696 blood samples were tested in Sligo.  In April, 16,649 samples were tested there, and in March, 11,748 samples were tested.  This testing was done by two staff, two girls.  There is only one girl there at the moment and one student because the other two are on maternity leave.  The laboratory is in need of modernisation. There is a proper computer system in Cork but in Sligo testing is done in the old way.  While this is adequate, we want a more modern system.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to Sligo yesterday, but there is no use in him coming to Sligo unless we can get the finance to make improvements.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to his senior Minister and to the Minister for Finance to make sure that the necessary finance is made available to make this laboratory into the very modern laboratory to which we are entitled in the north-west.  The whole north-west region is a great area for the export of cattle, especially the blue heifer and the Aberdeen Angus which are exported to Scotland and other parts of Europe.  We have to keep the Sligo laboratory open and modernise it.  Testing has to be carried out and not just in respect of exports.  I want to see scheme testing for the whole of Connacht-Ulster.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity <Col N="489" /> to speak on the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1998.  The fact that this matter comes before the House today, 30 June, before coming into effect tomorrow, 1 July, is a classic example of legislating on the hoof, whatever about anything else.  That holds true even if the Statutory Instrument before us forms part of that vast corpus of secondary or subordinate legislation which arises from Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that the costs of Irish farm producers are to be reduced, if only by a little.  It is important to recognise that the pressure to force down the prices paid to farmers is huge.  The Government must make a priority of tackling this very destructive pressure, which is largely driven from outside this country, or it will ultimately decimate our farming industry.  In this context it is important to mention the regulations of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to limit the size of super stores because it is the shareholder bases of those industries which is driving down the prices paid to Irish farmers.  The future of Irish farming is not a matter for concern to those shareholders.  If they cannot get their produce from Irish farms they will get it elsewhere. As long as it is on their shelves they do not care where it comes from.</P>
      <P>If this measure is a swallow, to use the metaphor, it does not tell us that the summer of sustainable agriculture and sane policy in the area of food production and distribution has arrived.</P>
      <P>There is a particular worry in the area of milk production.  Although milking parlours and so forth are scrupulously clean in the great majority of cases, whatever reduction there has been in the incidence of bovine diseases in dairy herds may equally be attributable, in some instances, to the dramatically increased use of pharmaceutical preparations and antibiotics in recent years along with the increasing intensification of farm methods.  That applies largely in relation to piggeries of enormous proportions, many of which I have visited.</P>
      <P>That intensification represents a trend which, if it continues, will tempt fate when it comes to infection and epidemics.  Such intensification of agriculture has to be addressed in overall policies when we are talking about the control of bovine diseases as well as other infections which would affect farming generally.</P>
      <P>I read a report of a recent meeting of the International Co-operative Association which took place in Cork.  A delegate to that conference from the Seikatsu Consumer Co-operative in Japan explained the origins of that movement which have important parallels with this country.  In the late 1960s, a mother in the city of Kanagawa in Japan began to notice a connection between her child's asthma and the milk she was drinking.  She set out by bicycle to find a farmer who produced milk without pharmaceutical inputs.  She found her farmer and a small co-operative group, called a HAN group, formed to take that farmer's weekly milk supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> That was the beginning of the Seikatsu Consumer Co-operative which is now the largest consumer co-operative in the world.  It has more than 200,000 members, is a major employer and has been the inspiration for citizens' action programmes which have seen almost 100 Japanese women elected to local government on the policy platform of safe food, fair trade in the chain of food distribution and direct links between producers and consumers.</P>
    <P>If such an idea were to take off here, it would be in the interests of Irish farming which currently is strongly controlled by pharmaceutical interests whose dominant control, in turn, is outside this country.  Irish farmers and consumers must recognise those links and begin to take initiatives which would help everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>These essential objectives are the same for environmentalists the world over and are a core part of the Green Party's food policies in Ireland. The lesson is that food safety is a matter of great public concern &mdash; we do not have to be reminded of that &mdash; and the treatment of bovine diseases is equally a matter of public concern.</P>
    <P>As regards the levy on animals slaughtered or exported live, it is a pity that the Minister has not used his discretion to differentiate between the two likely fates of cattle raised for beef on Irish farms.  One group of cattle is slaughtered here and another group is exported live, taking whatever added value they have with them.</P>
    <P>Although the Green Party is disposed towards the economic efficiencies of a mixed farming economy with much less consumption of meat, we are realists who have a vision of the ideal.  As realists, we are of the view that it would be appropriate for the Department of Agriculture and Food to distinguish between slaughter in the domestic economy and export on the hoof in the same way as the Department of Finance distinguishes between leaded and unleaded petrol.  Both substances perform the same basic function but with different side effects.  Both slaughter and export are economic uses of the bovine species by humanity.  This levy system does not differentiate between the two outcomes.  If we are thinking of the long-term self-reliance and viability of Irish farms, the levy system should so differentiate.</P>
    <P>Living along the coast in Balbriggan, I am surrounded by both a fishing and farming hinterland. It is becoming much more obvious to the fishing community that simply catching the fish and selling it is effectively exporting a great deal of added value.  Enormous efforts are currently being put into the development of processing which could have been done in the past but was not; perhaps people are now seeing the light in that regard.  In that way there will be less reliance on the export market which is important but volatile.  I ask the Minister to take that on board while welcoming the regulations.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who participated in the debate.  While <Col N="491" /> the debate was of short duration, they expressed keen interest in the subject.</P>
      <P>We are discussing an important subject and there was much praise for the Minister and the Government.  I am delighted with that because while this has been a good week for Irish agriculture, last week was exceptionally good due to the Minister's negotiations in Luxembourg which resulted in a saving of £2 million, making a total of £6 million.  I commend my colleague, Minister Joe Walsh, for his negotiating skills on the prices package for 1998 and 1999.  The decisions taken will particularly benefit beef and cereal farmers at a time when they are in need.</P>
      <P>As beef is Ireland's flagship industry, it was a particularly good outcome in that 60 per cent of the deseasonalisation premium has been retained for 1999.  The new arrangement should ensure that Ireland continues to have a more regular supply of product for export markets and that there is no swing back to a large autumn peak.</P>
      <P>We should all appreciate that Minister Walsh successfully rejected the Commission's proposal to fund the deseasonalisation slaughter premium by reducing the 22 month special beef premium. I commend the Minister and his officials for the outstanding job they did in Luxembourg.  They went there in difficult circumstances and arrived back with a good deal for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>The most important national animal disease programmes in terms of human, animal and financial considerations are the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes. Since the introduction of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, the total expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes has been more than £1 billion.</P>
      <P>The cost reductions involved in TB and brucellosis eradication programmes give support to the farming community and a saving of £2 million should be achieved in a 12 month period.  These changes were agreed at the Animal Health Forum which again has proved itself to be a constructive model for dialogue across the agri-sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Following a visit by Minister Walsh, Seamus Healy, Assistant Secretary, and other officials in the Department to the national brucellosis laboratory in Cork, delays in processing blood samples have been eliminated.  The processing of blood samples commences on the dates they are received in the laboratory. This is a welcome step which improves efficiency.  Many problems arose in the teething stages with the huge volumes of cases involved.  I am glad that, in co-operation with farming organisations and others, the matter has been speedily resolved to the satisfaction of all herd owners and private testing is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for his compliments on my visit to Sligo yesterday. The laboratory there is a fine facility.  Like Deputy Ring, Deputy Brennan made a case for setting up such laboratories on a regional basis. If money was available there are many things that could be done, but there are budgetary constraints. There may be merit in that argument, however, and I will speak to the Minister about it.</P>
      <P>The eradication of disease is a priority for my Department.  As our farmers are guardians of the countryside and are at the coalface of the disease problem, any opportunity to support their endeavours deserves full support from my Department.</P>
      <P>A number of queries were raised and I will take them in the order raised.  I accept there are a number of levies in the agriculture sector, which were introduced for purposes relating to meat inspection, Bord Bia and the disease eradication scheme.  The IFA levy was also mentioned.  That organisation does great work and is very helpful to farmers.  Bord Bia is a very deserving organisation that undertakes promotion and development on the home market and abroad.  Were it not for Bord Bia greater difficulties would be experienced.  That organisation does outstanding work on behalf of the food industry, not only in development but in bringing interested people to the coalface of business to see the Irish product. The developments in the past three or four years have been worthwhile for the food industry.</P>
      <P>In regard to disease levies, with the new rates farmers will pay about £8 million per year towards a scheme which will cost £75 million per year.  I accept farmers pay for some testing, but they carry less than one-third of the total cost of the schemes.  In addition, compensation for reactors, depopulation and other supports to farmers amounted to £26 million in 1997 and will reach a similar level this year.  Thus farmers get back in compensation what they contribute in monetary terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago farmers paid £28 million in levies. That was reduced to £10 million per year when farmers agreed to pay for first round tests <Col N="493" /> each year.  This £18 million reduction, which is separate from the proposal being considered today, was intended to compensate for the extra costs incurred by farmers at that time.  The reduction now under consideration is intended to meet about 50 per cent of the further costs of brucellosis testing.</P>
    <P>Deputies Connaughton and Deenihan referred to blackspots.  There is a programme in place to deal with blackspots.  Intensive contiguous testing is undertaken and areas have been targeted for the testing programme this year.  It must be remembered that there were herd breakdowns in all but two counties in 1997.  Thus it was necessary to introduce the regime throughout the country rather than on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>In regard to brucellosis tests, the range of tests undertaken are prescribed in EU trading regulations and currently are the best available internationally. As with all such tests, there are some inclusive results and false positives, but the numbers are relatively small in the overall context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton also raised the issue of depopulation.  An intensive depopulation regime has been pursued in regard to brucellosis.  For example, 254 herds were depopulated in 1997 and 111 herds were depopulated so far this year.  Each case is looked at on its merits and the first option is to save the herd.  If this is not possible, depopulation will usually be advised.  Deputies will appreciate that where disease reappears on a farm where depopulation has taken place recently, we must seriously consider whether a further depopulation is necessary.  Individual cases are considered on their merit and some holdings have been depopulated on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the question of compensation. There is a comprehensive system of compensation in place.  The system, which was complex, has been simplified somewhat by the recent changes.  Despite advertisements and individual letters to farmers, it remains difficult to get across to all farmers details regarding obligations and requirements.  We must, however, apply the rules fairly to all farmers.  If Deputies send me details of specific instances, I will arrange to have them examined.</P>
    <P>Herd numbers are granted for disease control and testing purposes and there is no question of discriminating against spouses where similar circumstances obtain in other cases.  If Deputies are aware of cases where difficulties arise, they should send me the details for examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of brucellosis in Kerry.  I agree the position is more serious in the south western part of the country than elsewhere.  Measures are in place for those counties.  It is too early to draw conclusions from testing results to date but, as the Minister said, they are a cause for concern.  We must fully apply the measures introduced and adopt a disciplined approach to cattle purchasing and herd management. Discipline is very important.  If there is lack of co-operation between the Department and the <Col N="494" /> various agencies involved and if there is no discipline at farm level, many millions of pounds of taxpayers' money will be spent in this area.  If the measures introduced are applied fairly, we will have a disease free status and will be the envy of every country in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to develop and implement policies relating to the protection of consumers of financial services generally,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage, which was intended to give a broader remit to the investor compensation company.  The remit of the company is set out in the Bill and the board of the company specifically includes representatives of consumers.  I consider this to be a sop as the company is a creature of the Central Bank.  Its administrative functions will be performed by the bank, it will exercise its powers in consultation with the bank and it will essentially take its remit from the bank in all but legislative name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment was to broaden the company's remit to look at consumer interests in financial services.  We have had plenty of experience in recent months where there appears to be a loophole in terms of responsibility for the consumer's interests in financial services.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, of course, has some responsibility, but it does not extend to the area covered by the Bill.  This was discussed at <Col N="495" /> great length on Committee Stage.  Has the Minister of State contemplated the matter further since?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns which prompted this amendment.  However, as I pointed out on Committee Stage the issues it raises go far beyond the compass of the Bill and the purpose of the investor compensation company.  The Bill deals with investor compensation and derives from a European directive on that subject, although in terms of its coverage it goes much further than the directive.  The purpose of the company, whose role the amendment proposes to adapt, is to administer the system of compensation and ensure it is adequately funded. Deputies will be aware the task of protecting the interest of consumers, including those of financial services, has been entrusted to the Director of Consumer Affairs under the terms of legislation sponsored by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am sure, of course, no criticism of the director's role is implied in the amendment.  I have no reason to believe that responsibility for any element of consumer protection should be taken from the director and conferred on a body whose sole purpose is to administer a scheme of compensation.  There will be a strong consumer representation on the board of the company.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's concerns may also have been prompted by recent allegations of malpractice in the banking sector and, as Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Finance set up a working group which is examining the area of banks and the consumer with special emphasis on the roles in law and practice of the Central Bank and the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure to the greatest extent possible that there can be no repeat of these practices.  The director is a member of this group which is chaired by an officer of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank is also represented.  The concerns which the Deputy specifically raised would be best addressed through that committee.  I, therefore, reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State agreed to amend section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, by allowing the compensation company to have access to certain information which the bank might uncover during the exercise of its supervisory role.  The board of the company will include consumer representation and this will be the first time representatives of consumers will have access to that information. Has the Minister of State been advised that it is possible to restrict the confidentiality requirements of the Central Bank more than we had understood heretofore?  When this was discussed last week on Committee Stage, he indicated that the committee currently discussing the matter within the Department was awaiting advice from <Col N="496" /> the Attorney General.  Did the tabling of this amendment indicate such advice had been received and, if it has, will he outline its nature?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 33, to delete &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are amendments to section 18 of the Bill, which outlines how directors of the company will be appointed.  It states that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will decide the number of directors which will be appropriate and this will be done by agreement.  It continues to state the Minister for Finance will select bodies which in his opinion have certain expertise in financial services and when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has agreed that these are appropriate, the bodies will appoint directors who, in effect, will bring to the company expertise from that background.</P>
      <P>In the other series of appointments, the Minister for Finance will decide what consumer bodies have expertise relevant to the investor's perspective. A body or bodies will be nominated and when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment agrees, these bodies will nominate directors.  We had a long discussion about this on Committee Stage and on reflection I believe that while it is appropriate that the Minister for Finance should carry out the primary function in respect of nominating the bodies which represent the industry, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have the primary responsibility in selecting bodies which represent the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes I propose are more focused than those I proposed on Committee Stage.  We will reverse the roles in respect of the consumer type directors and the bodies which will appoint persons familiar with the consumer as investor interest.  I know the Minister of State may argue that the Minister for Finance &ldquo;in agreement with&rdquo; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment puts both Ministers on an equal footing.  However, it does not and he will be aware that when the Minister is designated as having the primary function he will produce a list of bodies and if the other Minister assents, that is <Col N="497" /> it.  Given the positioning of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this instance her Department has more familiarity with bodies which represent the interests of consumers best whereas the Minister for Finance has more information on the industry.  This is a change which meets the points I made on Committee Stage and it improves the Bill.  It is not a major issue but I ask the Minister to take it on board.  It is correctly drafted because it is a reversal of what is in the Bill.  Therefore, there is no technical reason for not accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand and appreciate the merits of what the Deputy said.  I reflected on the issue since Committee Stage.  However, the Minister for Finance has responsibility for the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, under which the Central Bank regulates stock exchange member firms, and the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, under which the bank regulates investment business firms.  As Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced that she is drafting legislation to bring insurance intermediaries under the Investment Intermediaries Act.  It is against this background and in view of the role of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to consumer affairs, it is logical that both the Minister for Finance, having prepared the investor compensation Bill, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have a role in the appointment of the board of the investor compensation company.  The Deputy's amendment would give the lead role to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment rather than to the Minister for Finance as the Bill is drafted.</P>
      <P>However, given that section 18 provides that the Minister for Finance must have the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment when prescribing members and arranging for the appointment of directors, I cannot see how the Deputy's amendment in practice would make any difference.  In practice, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will play the lead role when it comes to consumer interests.  My view is that the balance of the board and the representation within the board of the company must be got right and it must be representative of consumers' interests.  I do not think, in practice, it makes any difference but for the reasons outlined it is better it remains as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity the Minister and his officials would not be more open to a sensible amendment.  The note the Minister has read is correct but it is out of date because he has repeated the reply he gave on Committee Stage. On Committee Stage I proposed a series of amendments which would have reversed the roles of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  After listening to that debate and the points made I am no <Col N="498" /> longer proposing that so that the Minister's reply is no longer correct.  What I am proposing now is that the Minister for Finance retain the lead role in nominating the bodies which have expertise in so far as the industry is concerned for the financial services and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have the lead role in so far as consumers are concerned.  It makes a difference in practice.  The law should reflect practice.  It is not a good defence for any Minister to say that is the law but in practical terms this is the way it will work.  There should not be a divergence between what is practical, the practice and the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware from his experience as a Minister that what will happen when this company is being set up is that the Minister will ask the officials of his Department to come forward with names of bodies that would be suitable under the terms of section 18 to nominate directors for the company.  It will probably be the officials who are present today and some of those we saw earlier.  While they have absolute confidence in relation to the industry, because they are attached to the Department of Finance and will be readily able to produce, after some consultation, a list of bodies, I do not think they have the same expertise in relation to consumer groups.  The Minister of State or the Minister will ask for names of bodies.  When the names of bodies are scanned, examined and culled it is at that point the Tánaiste, in her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will be asked to agree.</P>
      <P>In practice it would be much better if the Minister for Finance would select the bodies which represent the industry and if the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would represent the bodies which represent the consumer and that they would agree.  That is a more practical way of doing it.  I am asking the Minister to amend the section so that the law complies with what clearly will be the practice.  The Minister is not taking a great risk if he accepts this amendment. There is no major risk involved, it costs nothing.  It is just the insecurity of Ministers who feel their hand should be held by the officials that prevents them from taking on sensible amendments from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Deputy Noonan said.  I did reflect on the amendment and did not want to cause any confusion or be put in a position where I would eliminate from the Department of Finance some aspects of the Bill and suddenly invest them elsewhere.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy which is reasonable.  I do not have any great difficulty with it and I cannot imagine there should be any difficulty with it in law.  I cannot imagine that in practice there would be any great difficulty.  Therefore, I will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 23, line 44, to delete &ldquo;20,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;80,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to one of the central provisions in the Bill, the maximum amount of compensation that can be provided by the company. We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  Most of us on this side felt the maximum of 20,000 ECU or £15,500 was far too low.  People reading the reports of the proceedings of this House will note we have passed a Bill intending to compensate them.  If they go away and on return have to rely on the provisions of this Bill which is capped at £15,500 they will be less than satisfied.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated he was willing to contemplate that even if we accept that the maximum of 20,000 ECU, which is the minimum provided for in the directive, is to apply for the moment we should give some thought to how it should be increased in the future.  We all know that the experience with this type of Bill is that generally it will not be revisited unless we discover a problem. The most likely event is that something goes bust in five or ten years' time and there is a public outcry that the compensation has been capped at such a low amount.  Whereas £15,500 is relatively insignificant, it may well be even more insignificant in ten or 15 years' time or whenever this Bill is called into play in a serious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we discussed the possibility that either the bank, or, more likely, the Minister would be given power by way of regulation to change at some time in the future the maximum amount of compensation that could be provided. Nobody is suggesting the Minister would do that in response to a particular crisis.  It is not as if something would blow up and the Minister would suddenly unilaterally decide that one may provide compensation at 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 ECU.  Clearly this is not something that could be <Col N="500" /> done retrospectively, it would have to be done prospectively.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling case for giving power to the Minister, by way of regulation, or to the bank or the company to make a change in the maximum compensation that can be provided at some time in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a similar amendment. Deputy McDowell has recited the arguments in favour of increasing the amount of compensation. While the figure of 20,000 ECU appears in the directive, it is a minimum figure.  Governments of member states have discretion to bring in a compensation scheme in excess of that minimum of 20,000 ECU per injured investor.  I realise the Minister has extended the scope of the Bill beyond the scope of the directive and that the compensation will apply to categories of investors in categories of companies beyond the scope of the directive.  He should have gone a step further and extended the amount of compensation for individual investors also.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy McDowell I implied I would not press the amendment on Report Stage had the Minister tabled an amendment to take power to change the amount by regulation.  It is a simple provision which we asked the Minister to consider on Committee Stage.  If he said: the Minister may vary this amount, as he sees fit but that any variation would only apply from the date of the order, that would ensure the Minister was not forced into making regulations because a particular intermediary has gone bust.  I do not want that to happen.</P>
      <P>However, £15,500 or 20,000 ECUs is a modest sum to offer to people injured by the fraud of an intermediary who takes away their savings or investments and it will look extremely small in five years' time.  While the pace of legislation in this House is efficient, it is slow, and a long time elapses between the original decision to do something and its signing into law by the President. The Minister has put himself in the position whereby he must introduce primary legislation to increase the amount of compensation which will be bestowed on an investor under the provisions of this Bill.  Given that he has not introduced a Report Stage amendment to allow himself the flexibility to regulate an increase, I will join Deputy McDowell in pressing for an increase in the text of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this issue at length this morning I do not see any point in repeating my arguments.  Deputy Noonan mentioned the £15,500 fine but there is no fine at present, so that is at least a reasonable step forward.  It would be marvellous if the total investment could be claimed but that is not the purpose of the scheme &mdash; it is to put in place a reasonable insurance policy, to provide for a compensation fund and to offer protection to investors who have been defrauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies made points this morning which <Col N="501" /> I said I would consider, and I will turn directly to them.  There are a number of other important points but they have been put on the record so often that there is no need to repeat them.  On Committee Stage I said I would consider two suggestions; Deputy Noonan said the Minister should have power to increase the amount of compensation while Deputy McDowell said the Investor Compensation Company itself should have the power.  The amount of compensation is central to the provisions of the Bill &mdash; every other provision concerning compensation is to ensure it is paid.  I do not think it particularly appropriate to leave it open to a Minister to amend the central <Col N="502" /> provision of a Bill by regulation.  I would have thought it more appropriate that it should come back to the House for amendment, rather than allowing a Minister to take that power unto himself. Also, since Committee Stage I have not had time to seek the view of the Office of the Attorney General as to whether it is legally possible to include such a provision.  For those reasons I would not be enthusiastic about the amendments and I think I am correct in not accepting them.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 50, after &ldquo;firm&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;including money owed or liable to be recovered in an action or potential action by the client for damages arising from negligent advice given by the investment firm,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was also discussed this morning and, as the Minister knows, it is at the heart of the Bill.  It seeks to explore the circumstances in which compensation will be paid by the compensation company.  I expressed reservations this morning that, while it is intended to provide compensation only in cases where money has been fraudulently misused or appropriated, this does not appear in the Bill.  The Minister undertook to consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Bill's curiosities. While the Minister stated several times on Committee Stage that the circumstances which would give rise to an intervention by the company to compensate investors would be due to fraud in the first instance, these circumstances are not outlined in the Bill.  One could envisage other circumstances in which the funds of investors would be lost, where fraud would not be perpetrated, and yet a valid claim for compensation could be lodged.  In the context of explaining the point, I would be pleased if the Minister would outline how, in circumstances in which a company goes under and a liquidator or administrator takes over, it will be established that investors have a claim on the company.  Will he also summarise how such a valid claim would be communicated to the company and how it would adjudicate on the validity of the claim?  At what point would the company decide the claims were bona fide and pay out compensation up to 90 per cent of 20,000 ECU or 20,000 ECU, whichever is the lesser, in respect of each investment?  I understand that in normal circumstances it will be paid within six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The company does not have an adjudicating role.  It simply pays out the compensation. It does not adjudicate on the matters to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell would extend the scope of the Investor Compensation Bill to include cases where an intermediary has been negligent.  The Deputy said on Committee Stage that he saw this amendment as a way of opening up a debate on the section and on the exact circumstances in which investor compensation will be paid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide compensation for the clients of investment and insurance intermediaries where the intermediary is unable to return money or investment instruments owed to or belonging to a client.  The Bill implements the Investor Compensation Directive and the wording of section 30(1) reflects the wording of article 2 of the directive.  In framing the Investor Compensation Bill, it was decided to align the provisions of the Bill with the requirements of the directive, but to extend the scope of compensation to include all investment and insurance intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may help if I repeat a point here which I made on Committee Stage and which is important in relation to Deputy McDowell's amendment.  The Investor Compensation Company will not be a form of tribunal to which aggrieved investors bring cases for compensation and which will decide those claims.  Compensation will not be paid on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis.  The reason for section 30 is to set objective criteria for entitlement to compensation.  An investor will have to establish that he or she is a creditor of the investment firm.  One might ask who will decide on investors' claims.  In simple terms, that will be the role of the liquidator, assuming the investment firm is being liquidated.  If a liquidator is not appointed, either because liquidation does not arise or because it is not worth anybody's while appointing one, the bank will appoint an administrator to verify investors' claims.  In either case, the role of the liquidator or administrator is <Col N="505" /> the same, to establish as quickly as possible whether the investor is a creditor of the firm in terms of section 30 and the amount which the firm is unable to return.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell appeared to be interested in establishing whether an investor could claim compensation where he or she had lost money through negligence on the part of the investment firm.  I am satisfied entitlement to compensation will arise where an investment firm has defrauded an investor and that is what we set as the minimum coverage for investor compensation. Deputy McDowell pointed out that the text of the Bill does not state compensation arises only in relation to fraud.  That is true because part of the function of the Bill is to transpose the Investor Compensation Directive and we did not want to include any text which would cut across the legal scope of the directive.  The preamble to the directive indicates that investor compensation is intended to cover fraud, but the actual text of the directive does not make a specific reference in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of extending the coverage of the Bill to include negligence, which of course we are free to do, many of the arguments which I put forward on amendments Nos. 6 and 7 apply here.  Those amendments proposed extending investor compensation by increasing the amount of compensation.  This amendment proposes extending the scope of compensation by including negligence.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned to ensure investor compensation will operate effectively.  Therefore, I must reject this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I need to make a versional correction to section 79 of the Bill, under Standing Order 126.  The amendment reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 58, line 6 to insert &ldquo;as&rdquo; after &ldquo;and the section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to insert a word which was mistakenly omitted from the text of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan queried whether, under section 21(1) investment firms should be replaced by authorised investment firms.  The definition of &ldquo;investment firms&rdquo; includes firms which are currently authorised to provide investment business services and those firms which have had their authorisation revoked.  It is intended to ensure that firms who have had their <Col N="506" /> authorisations revoked can still be obliged to pay outstanding contributions to the Investor Compensation Company.  Deputies Noonan and McDowell raised the issue of whether the requirement to establish a complaints procedure should more properly be placed on the compensation company.  I am anxious that these procedures should be put in place, and imposing a specific duty on the board of the company is the best way to achieve this aim.  The point of the section is to ensure the board will listen to complaints.</P>
      <P>On section 60 we spoke about the 14 day issue and I considered the matter.  I was anxious to foreshorten it, but I am advised that if an intermediary or some other person has to post a notice, they may need to take legal advice on the matter and need time to prepare.  I want to allow reasonable time to deal with the issue properly and I do not want to include an unworkable measure.  Therefore, on balance, it would be more appropriate to retain the 14 day limit.</P>
      <P>I thank all Members for their involvement in the Bill.  It was a fairly intensive session and the legislation is the better for it.  I also wish to thank my officials for helping me with the background preparation of the Bill and steering it through the House.  I wish the investor compensation company well. Many officials from the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's working group also helped with the legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for initiating this Bill.  It is timely for us to have a serious debate about two issues that are raised by the Bill, public access to major media events of cultural and sporting significance and fair competition, and fairness in the amount of media control we should have, in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The principle of access for all to important sporting and cultural events is of great importance. It is desirable that we should develop this approach.  There has been some debate in recent days on the issue of whether these are compensatable rights or not.  That is the only issue on which there can be any division.  It is fundamental that people should have a right of access to sporting events on the terrestrial channels.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins's approach may run into some practical difficulties.  This is because if one draws up a list one must decide, for example, whether to broadcast the Derby but not allow exclusive coverage of the Oaks.  Will the line be drawn between the Oaks and the 1,000 Guineas?  In a spectrum of such events where will one draw the line and say that the right of access is fundamental and, therefore, non-compensatable.  It would become extraordinarily difficult to stand over that sort of approach because these are shades of grey.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, the arguments must be much stronger for some form of compensation for the event organisers.  In many cases we might not have sympathy with the organisers of such events. Equally, however, if an FAI cup final featured St. Patrick's Athletic and a smaller country club struggling to break through and which had a strong community commitment, we would like to see them benefiting financially from their club's success.</P>
      <P>The issue that needs to be added to the legislation on Committee Stage is a recognition that these are major events and those who work hard to stage them should have some right of recognition. Other than that, the approach by Deputy Higgins is admirable and deserves our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue is much more important from the long-term perspective.  We all want to have access to important cultural and sporting events. However, the issue of fairness in competition and not having excessive control of the media, goes to the very heart of our democracy.  I have been impressed by the argument, put forward on more than one occasion by the National Newspapers of Ireland, that newspapers are not just like any other product.  Newspapers, and the media generally, should reflect our cultural diversity.  We must maintain the media as an expression of our cultural distinctiveness.  It is also important for us to maintain a media that is competitive.  It is not <Col N="508" /> healthy either for our media to be overrun by outside interests or for it to be controlled excessively by any one interest.</P>
    <P>We are in an unusual position in that the media in Ireland is predominantly controlled by a small number of interests.  RTE is still the major player in our broadcast media and in the newspaper industry the Independent group is now so dominant it probably has a 90 per cent share.  In the case of RTE there are very strong legislative controls on the approach it must take to honour its public service broadcasting role and ensuring fairness in the way it approaches its work.  That is not the case in the newspaper industry.  I do not think anyone would want to see legislative controls on the way newspapers handle their editorial content. That is what makes this Bill so important; it is trying to address competition issues in a way that does not involve the Legislature in trying to dictate opinions that are expressed or in trying to ensure that both sides of the argument are invariably expressed.</P>
    <P>We must put in place a competition regime that ensures diversity without drawing the State into that sort of undesired media control.  We need to address the fundamental issue of cross ownership. It is bad enough that 90 per cent of the national newspapers are controlled by one group, but it would be unthinkable if one saw a similar control of the broadcast media beginning to develop.  In the UK, some of the cross ownership between the major satellite television magnates and their newspaper interests is very unhealthy.  It is not a development we should seek to replicate.</P>
    <P>I have some misgivings about the detail of the Bill.  Deputy Higgins is defining an abuse of dominance as owning more than 25 per cent in two different media.  Abuses of dominance are, <i>ipso facto,</i> prohibited.  Therefore, he is requiring that a person would either not own, or divest themselves of, shares greater than 25 per cent.  One runs into difficulties where Deputy Higgins introduces some exclusions to this provision.  He says that if ownership was designed to deny ownership from outside the State it could be let through.  I am uneasy with that sort of provision and, in any event, it sits uneasily with our European obligations. Deputy Higgins clearly envisages that it would not only apply to non-EU owners but also EU owners.  That aspect of his Bill is problematic.</P>
    <P>The very broad and loose definition of control is also problematic.  It seems that if one had indirect control &mdash; and however indirect is not specified &mdash; one could have very little real cross ownership in these interests.  However, it would trigger an abuse of dominance and an immediate divesting of ownership.  That may be particularly problematic when one comes down to defining indirect control.  I know Deputy Higgins is only talking about the State market, but it is equally important that we try to maintain diversity in local markets.  Although we already have some provisions to do so, it would not be healthy to ban local newspapers from having excessive ownership of local radio stations.  We do not have <Col N="509" /> a similar provision in reverse.  There are difficulties in the tight way Deputy Michael Higgins has tried to draw this.  The ceilings are rigidly defined at 25 per cent but the ownership is loosely defined.  That could cause serious difficulties in practical terms, although I do not have immediate proposals to amend it.</P>
    <P>Although I was surprised that the Commission on the Newspaper Industry did not come up with any proposals in relation to cross-media ownership, it did, nonetheless, give a signal that merger control was the best way forward.  In other words, if a newspaper proposed to acquire control in a radio station, it would have to get permission but the Minister, having obtained the views of the Competition Authority, could turn down the merger.  It would avoid having to rigidly define these 25 per cent ceilings in the scheme.  I am more sympathetic to that type of approach. However, it would only be worth considering if there was cross ownership in the State, but luckily that is not the case.  As a result, I would prefer the merger option.</P>
    <P>This debate is extremely important.  We must be concerned about the excessive concentration in the newspaper market.  The Commission on the Newspaper Industry pointed out that our merger policies are not sufficient.  It advocated that our merger policies must curb any control over another newspaper which does not involve direct acquisition of shares but involves the use of loans. It is widely known that one of the problems with the demise of the <i>Irish Press</i> was that the Independent Group was seeking to take control through loan mechanisms rather than direct ownership.</P>
    <P>Extra work needs to be done on this Bill on Committee Stage.  However, it is important that it has been published.  The House must endorse the principle behind it.  We should take time to consider how to develop Committee Stage proposals. I congratulate Deputy Higgins for introducing this Bill which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins on introducing this Bill.  The fact it has been introduced by an Opposition Deputy shows the inertia in the Department about broadcasting policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mission statement published by the Department states that the core elements of this framework, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, will include the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity and will ensure adequate ongoing support for the service.  We know that no separate statutory functions have been given to Teilifís na Gaeilge and that appeals for adequate ongoing support for the service have fallen on deaf ears.  The station is looking for £3 million to allow it to function properly into 1999 but it has not yet received a reply.  The mission statement also states that there is a provision to ensure that television coverage of major domestic sporting events remains accessible to Irish viewers on free to air <Col N="510" /> television such as RTÉ, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition she made a speech about the terrible catastrophe it would be if emergency legislation was not published by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins.  It seems strange that a Bill introduced by Deputy Michael Higgins, who has great expertise in this area, has been rejected by the Minister.  She said she has other proposals.  We have been told that a broadcasting Bill will be published, yet the Tánaiste informed the House today that it will not be introduced until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The committee, of which I am Chairman, is aware that major companies in the UK intend to establish digital broadcasting in September. Where will that leave RTÉ and the other national television stations?  When the analogue system was set up, people on the east coast watched BBC and UTV.  However, when digital broadcasting is introduced, world-wide channels will be available and people will get into the habit of watching other stations.  This will be a major culture shock because we will not have our own television stations.  RTÉ will not be able to compete unless the Minister makes a decision on what she intends to do about broadcasting in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also sought to tackle other issues over the years.  We have been swamped by American culture.  If one looks at the programmes on RTÉ television tonight and on Teilifís na Gaeilge, one will see a greater proportion of Irish culture on Teilifís na Gaeilge than on RTÉ which is dominated by American or non-European cultures.  If Deputy Michael Higgins included provisions in this Bill to limit cross-ownership, he did so in the full knowledge of what is being imported.  He was an active Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and he attended many broadcasting meetings in Europe during our European Presidency.  One of his greatest successes was the inclusion of culture in the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that the main Government party which, when in Opposition, shouted about Irish heritage and culture and accused the Rainbow Coalition of having no respect for the Irish language, dropped culture from the Department's title.  Culture is important.  Today the Minister for Culture in France honoured two Irish artistes, including Van Morrison, with the badge of honour from her Department.  That was the result of the music connection which was made at the <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> by Deputy Higgins when he was Minister.  The Department seems to be paralysed when it comes to making major decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been busy.  The regulator she appointed is admirable, well versed and has thoroughly studied the technical side of broadcasting. However, the Taoiseach did not seem to appreciate that broadcasting policy, and all the technical effects, should be grouped together in one Department.  He divided them up for whatever <Col N="511" /> reason.  I suppose he did not want another dictatorship of the media to evolve or for some Minister to become too powerful.  There is no communication between the Department responsible for public companies and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  For that reason I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins has produced quality legislation. He knows what he is talking about.  The Bill can be easily amended in committee.  Some of the valid suggestions made by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, might be considered by Deputy Higgins.  Having regard to the Minister's speech, all the indications are that she will continue with this indolence and no decision will be made in her Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have been introduced long before now.  The English Rugby Football Union decided to hold its franchise on the televising of international games and that was a problem during 1998.  While I am not a rugby fan that game brings in substantial tourism revenue here.  As the Minister said, it has some import for generating cultural feelings.  Even though some of us might not know much about the game, we would like to see Ireland win a rugby match.  However, we will not see Ireland win a rugby match on television in the future because we do not have the necessary legislation in place.  The British Rugby Football Union has taken a decision and effectively given a thumbs up to international legislation.  I urge the Minister to go back to the Council of Ministers and ask the Ministers with responsibility for culture what effective legislation they will introduce in addition to provisions of the directive which need to be expanded.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been written about the impact of digital TV, its many facets and how it will lead to a merger between telephones, telecommunications and television giving rise to an exchange of technical services.  Those services are being developed at a rapid pace, but we are a long way behind in that regard.  There is an information age town in Ennis, but it has taken a long time for people there to even become accustomed to the view that Telecom will provide PCs for every household in the Ennis urban district area.  Also, the message that they need training to use a PC has not been properly delivered.</P>
    <P>If we are to foster Irish culture through native programmes on RTE, we need to take immediate steps.  One way for the Minister to indicate her intention to do that would be to support Deputy Higgins's Bill.  He took a courageous step in introducing it.  I had hoped the Minister, Deputy de Valera, would have had the courage to accept it. She acknowledged the Deputy's good work, but I cannot see anything in her Second Stage speech to indicate that any flaws in the Bill could not be amended.</P>
    <P>In an era of technological revolution, it is disappointing that officials in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands advised <Col N="512" /> against accepting this Bill.  I doubt they did that because they realise the former Minister is the expert in this area.  If the Department needs to draft a Bill, they should take him on as an adviser.</P>

      <P>I was quite moved by the end of Deputy Carey's contribution.  I was trying to start a Mexican wave for Deputy Higgins, but, unfortunately, I am stuck on the back benches and on my own, a double inequity.  This is an interesting Bill and I do not say that in a patronising way.  It is interesting for a variety of reasons.  I had not intended to make a contribution to this debate, but I was quite moved by some of the po-faced hypocrisy evident in the contributions of some of the more extreme elements on the left.</P>
      <P>This Bill is timely and a debate on media dominance is long overdue.  The media is such a powerful force in any modern democracy that we must all be mindful of the need to achieve the proper balance between control and freedom. Deputy Higgins's Bill deals cogently with one aspect of the issue.  I would not have any problem with the device adopted by the previous Government with regard to my freedom of information Bill, to pass Second Stage, put it on hold until the Government produces its Bill and then to marry minds on all sides in this regard.  I am not sure if I am supposed to say that, but it slipped out.</P>
      <P>The media is a powerful force in modern democracy.  From time to time we must debate the changing circumstances that present themselves and how to achieve the proper balance between control and freedom.  Some argue very strongly that the freedom we have to date in this area has meant that, without any regulation, those who operate in the print and, to a lesser extent, in the electronic media, have done what Adam Smith so long ago astutely forecast they would do, they have conspired to promote their private interest at the public's cost.  We do not have to look too far to see that happening.  Having regard to what is happening with the media internationally, it is a fact it is becoming excessively dominated.  That domination is a threat not only to democracy here but internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen internationally how powerful electronic news media have had to tailor the imagery they present, for example, in the case of China because it might have trespassed on some of Mr. Murdoch's other international activities. Irrespective of whether we are talking about this island or internationally, it is an undeniable fact that the domination of the media is a powerful and dangerous issue that requires attention.  Individual domination of the media is to be avoided, irrespective of whether we are talking about <Col N="513" /> ownership of television, radio or newspapers or some other form of domination.  I commend the Bill's proposer for forcing us for the first time to focus on this issue.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the debate to date which I do not commend is the po-faced hypocrisy of some speakers on the left in this debate.  I was astounded last week when I heard the doyenne of left wing hypocrisy, Deputy McManus, say that the only problem she and her fellow travellers identified is the threat of dominance through ownership of the media.  I do not lump any of the speakers present tonight in that group.  I acknowledge that ownership is a major threat, but intellectual domination is equally a threat to the media and it is a peculiar threat which is evident and obvious here.  There has been an attempt over the years to create a type of intellectual hegemony which dominates the thinking of those who produce, report and disseminate the news. This is a dominance which is more subtle but no less dangerous than dominant and excessive ownership concentration.</P>
    <P>I accept the point which Deputy Higgins is making about the excessive concentration of ownership, but the hegemony of intellectual thought in the media is something which few politicians have had the guts to acknowledge because of course it is politically incorrect to do it.  For example, when I have something to say about RTE, I doubt RTE will give my contributions much space.  That raises the issue of the kind of domination about which we are concerned.  Is it domination when it affects us and our particular prejudice or when it affects the objective balance in the way news is presented, broadcast and reported?  This particular type of domination, the domination of the intellectual content and presentation of the news, is largely ignored and always under reported because of the demands of political correctness.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the reality is that we have long since ceased to have a news media in Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that there is a requirement that the news be objective.  I feel incredibly uncomfortable with the manner in which the news has been operating in the past ten or 15 years.  Increasingly, we are losing the old concept of newspapers or news media and getting &ldquo;viewspapers&rdquo; and &ldquo;views media&rdquo;.  I acknowledge that some media people are uncomfortable about this. There were two particular articles, one of which was in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently, in which this specific point was made.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, although not always, those who dominate the editorial content have been of the left.  I say &ldquo;not always&rdquo; because there are certainly some people distinctly of the right who also sit in high positions.  This has not happened by accident.  It has happened because we have allowed it to happened.  It has happened because there are not enough people with sufficient moral courage to stand up and say we have gone wrong on this issue.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s, we all know there was an attempt <Col N="514" /> to infiltrate and command news rooms in this city. That particular infiltration was by the Stickies, the Workers' Party.  That is well known.  People in the Press Gallery acknowledge it privately and they will talk about it privately, but they are not prepared to write about it publicly.  Deputy McManus was a senior member of that party at that time.  She was a prominent member of Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin Workers' Party and The Workers' Party in its various manifestations when a wellknown columnist was a prominent leader of the intellectual wing as opposed to the more earthy, physical force wing of Sinn Féin through the 1970s.  I did not hear that Deputy, or her fellow travellers, being anything other than as silent as the grave on the issue of the domination of the media here.  When the same well-placed columnist played an extraordinary role in the shaping and reporting of news in the then State-owned electronic monopoly, RTE, none of the spokespersons from Sinn Féin or The Workers' Party had anything to say on the issue of dominance, particularly the intellectual dominance of the news media.  The Deputy did not wring her hands then and demand an even playing field.  The standard tack when this allegation is made is to either ignore it or deny it, but one cannot deny the facts. The facts remain that there was at that time and remains an excessive degree of domination of one type of political philosophy within news rooms.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the bleatings of most of those on the extreme left about the domination of the media is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Opposition either of the left or right seemed to have been seized most actively of the dangerous position of the domination of the media in recent times.  If in its front page editorial Independent Newspapers had trumpeted, for example, the benefits of voting for Fine Gael, Labour or Democratic Left on the eve of the last election, would we have witnessed the outcry about media bias which we have seen here.  I must acknowledge that we did not criticise it either so we are no better than the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If I appear to be hypocritical, I ask the House to accept I am not.  I am just making the plain and obvious point that wherever we stand in the political firmament, we should wake up to the reality that there is something unacceptable happening within the media when it is dominated either by people who are put in position because of their political philosophy or people who are put in commanding heights of the media because of their pockets.  It does not matter to me whether personal ownership or politics has dominated the media.  What I, as a citizen, am concerned about, and what I am sure Deputy Higgins would be equally concerned about is the evident unhealthy bias and that the high standards have started to collapse.</P>
    <P>The media were expected to give and gave, without interference, those who wrote the columns or broadcast in the electronic media the right to express an honest view, whether it was in favour or against a particular line.  It is correct to <Col N="515" /> say that there is something unsettling when the media is abused to peddle a particular line, whether at the personal behest of the owner or at the political behest of somebody.  It is particularly unsettling when the considerable power of the media is used to peddle a line dictated by a powerful self-interested individual in the media, whether that powerful self-interest is the self-interest of ownership or of somebody who has acquired a high editorial position.  It is wrong for anyone to control the output of any sector of the media or to slant that output whether for politics or because of the power that comes with ownership.</P>
    <P>The great pity about this debate is that it has not been ongoing for the past ten or 15 years.  I commend the Bill, not in a patronising way but because it forces us to debate these issues.  There is a need for a full-blooded, no holds barred debate on the media here, its balance and all the factors which govern its control and that debate has not taken place.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the unhealthy media domination with which I want to deal briefly, that is the Dublin 4 centred bias within the media. Again, this requires debate and examination.  I do not live far from Dublin 4 but when I look at the televised news or read the newspapers it seems that anything which happens between the two canals in Dublin city is reported.  However, unless a matter outside that geographical focus is significant, it will not be covered.  This was addressed recently in a most interesting editorial in one of the provincial newspapers which took to task the media personalities, the &ldquo;views peddlers&rdquo; as opposed to the news reporters in some of the national newspapers.  That editor was absolutely right.  The bias in favour of the city is astonishing, as is the way the news, the variety and richness of the culture, and all that happens in provincial Ireland is ignored.  Looking at RTE or reading some of the national newspapers, one is struck by how parochial they have become.</P>
    <P>On balance the media in Ireland are good and they reflect quality.  However, when I go to the United States I am struck by the parochial nature of its news media.  It is extraordinary the way the media ignores anything which happens outside a ten mile catchment zone of the particular television station.  We are moving in that direction.  It is a type of intellectual laziness which has to be addressed quickly.  When that sloth enters journalism and editorial thinking we will end up regretting it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey complained about the lack of coverage of issues in the west.  Deputy Higgins waxed eloquent on the issue on more than one occasion but nobody is listening or paying attention. We will have not just an individually dominated ownership of the media but also an intellectually dominated media which will squeeze out the variety of the nation.  This is not a phenomenon that we should allow to take hold.  I hope the issue will be addressed in a White Paper or <Col N="516" /> discussion document.  One thing is certain, we should not hold our breath waiting for newsrooms to take up this aspect of the debate.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the provincial newspapers and local radio stations, in terms of news, much of the country, particularly rural areas, would remain uncovered and unreported.  I was delighted when it was suggested recently that the earmarking of a portion of the broadcast tax yield, the television licence, for use by local radio stations should be considered.  I have been arguing for a number of years that the television licence fee is a tax which was instituted for one reason only, that is, to fund public service broadcasting.  It was a good and progressive measure at the time.  There are now a variety of media broadcasters which have public news obligations.  The Minister should, therefore, give serious consideration to the possibility of earmarking a portion of the broadcast tax yield for allocation to good independent current affairs productions at local level.</P>
    <P>I was asked recently by the editor of a local newspaper why it should be confined to local radio stations.  He argued &mdash; his argument has great merit &mdash; that we should also think in terms of the provincial newspapers.  News gathering is not cheap.  If we are to have a healthy, vibrant independent local news media, it will have to be supported.  If we do not have a healthy, vibrant independent local news media, we will leave the way open for domination.  That would be unhealthy.</P>
    <P>There was a thought provoking article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday by a class mate of mine, Jack Banville, in which he drew attention to a cartoon by Gary Larson in the Far Side series of cartoons to make a point about individuality, the herd instinct and the importance of diversity.  In the cartoon strip Larson depicts a flock of sheep in the midst of which there is an indignant black-faced sheep protesting loudly that &ldquo;we're eating grass&rdquo;.  It is a solitary protest.  Do we have in the media enough hardy souls and black-faced sheep who are prepared to stand up and say that they are being forced to report, write and broadcast grass?</P>
    <P>For a short time I wrote articles for one of the newspapers.  I was struck by the lack of confidence and the fact that newsrooms would check with each other on the line being taken.  Surely, they are adult and confident enough to have diversity of lines.  In reportage if one tries to follow the same line, one is no better or no worse than the flock in Gary Larson's cartoon.  Banville made the point about the individuality of Nietzche but I make it about the need for individuality within the press and media.</P>
    <P>The Bill has much to commend it.  Perhaps it is possible to accept it and push it to one side until such time as the extent of the Minister's proposed legislation becomes clear.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that there is a need for comprehensive legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the broadcasting of specific events on an exclusive basis by a broadcaster <Col N="517" /> establishing or operating within the State.  This is a most obnoxious and pernicious aspect of the media.  I listened recently to a debate on this subject in the United Kingdom where it has become a major issue.  Those who follow cricket, for example, are being denied coverage.  The same is true of international rugby.  The southern hemisphere tour appears to be an extension of Sky broadcasting.  This is wrong.  I hope the matter will be addressed nationally and internationally. Deputy Higgins's proposition is in line with what is being proposed at European level.  There is a need to create in law the situation that he foresees in section 1 which I commend to the Minister who I know shares his views.  I look forward to her legislation incorporating this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the preparation of a list of sporting and cultural events which would not be capable of being violated by the demands of the marketplace.  Section 2 would also amend the Competition Act, 1991, by dealing with the term &ldquo;abuse of dominant position&rdquo;.  This is covered by Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome but, as the Minister and Deputy Higgins well know, there is an abundance of extraordinarily interesting case law as to what constitutes abuse of dominant position. In the cases of B and I v. Sealink and Aer Lingus v. British Midlands it was recognised that one could have a dominant position in a particular geographical location.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address &mdash; it would be difficult to address it in a short Bill &mdash; what exactly is meant by dominant position.  Deputy Higgins is trying to relate it to the objective test of ownership. Perhaps that is the only way to deal with it. If there is only one radio station or one newspaper in a particular geographical location, it is in a dominant position.  It will not amount to an abuse of a dominant position until the owner or editor or both decide to peddle a single political line or a single line on a particular issue.</P>
    <P>What we should be trying to create within the media is intellectual freedom, a sense of one's own worth among those who write, prepare and broadcast the news, a willingness to stand up and occasionally to be wrong.  Political correctness has descended on the media.  This distresses me.  It is terrified to praise or to blame.  My party has come in for more than a fair share of the blame.  I do not like demonisation of politics, although occasionally in the heat of debate I may engage in it.  All political sides have a viewpoint which should be capable of expression.  Deputy Michael Higgins is a political realist and I hope that if the Bill is voted down he will not believe his labours have been in vain.  The Deputy's efforts have provoked some thought in respect of an area with which we have failed to deal.  I commend him for that.  There are elements in the Bill which are wholly praiseworthy and I look forward to their incorporation with equal vigour in the legislation the Minister proposes to introduce.</P>

Ó hUiginn, as ucht an Bille seo a ullmhú agus a thabhairt os comhair na Dála. Bhí sé go hiontach an teachtain seo caite nuair a bhí sé ag moladh an Bille seo don Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I propose to share time with Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Bill which was ably introduced last week by Deputy Higgins.  While the Bill deals with media matters, it also raises issues which must be addressed in the context of the expanding global acceptance of the market economy. Since the fall of the command economies, this has been the dominating feature of the international economy in general.</P>
      <P>How often is the cliché &ldquo;competition is a good thing&rdquo; repeated by commentators?  In broad terms this cliché represents a fundamental truth but, in saying that, we must define our terms. When we discuss competition, we mean fair competition. There are serious implications for competition where monopolies exist.  Markets can also become distorted where a sole provider of goods or services holds an overly dominant position. There is a growing emphasis on consumers and the cliché that the &ldquo;consumer is king&rdquo; is also often repeated.  The consumer is king where there is a truly free market.  However, where a market is distorted due to a monopoly or an overly dominant position, then the monopolist or the holder of the overly dominant position is king.</P>
      <P>Equally, there is a danger of seeing our citizens as mere consumers.  Subsidiarity is a term which the EU has added to our vocabulary.  In essence, it means that the decision-making process in brought as close as possible to those affected by it.  The other buzz word in this regard is &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo;.  The concept of subsidiarity is laudable and it is something towards which we must strive.  However, in order that the community at large is stimulated to engage in comprehensive debate and arrive at informed and balanced decisions, it is imperative that wide-ranging information and views are promulgated in the media.</P>
      <P>Creative, radical, challenging and conservative views all have a place in what is fundamentally an educational process.  This is in no way to suggest that there is not a worthwhile range of diversity in the indigenous media and from non-national sources.  Legislation, however, has a lasting effect and, in many cases, it is most valuable in its fire brigade role.  On the global scene there is a propensity towards monopoly in the ownership of single media or more than one media form.  This is apparent in the print media in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergence of an information culture rich and poor in terms of media consumption is a further concern which leads me to deal with the other part of the Bill.  Media consumption has <Col N="519" /> become such an integral part of the lives of citizens that the guiding principle must be equality of access.  To put it another way, access should be within the comfortable financial reach of all citizens.  This is particularly true of television.  It is nothing short of outrageous that many people could be denied access to major sporting events unless they pay a further direct charge or pay it indirectly by being obliged to attend particular licensed premises.</P>
    <P>There is a broad debate here which relates to the area of sport and television.  Against the background of accepting that everything has a limited lifespan, one must seriously question the long-term effects of the vast sums of money involved. The great strength of sport is that it belongs and is accessible to everyone.  If this ceases to be the case, one must fear for the long-term.  Over-commercialisation must be avoided.</P>
    <P>A problem exists in my constituency which has it origins in injudicious decisions made in respect of the rebroadcast of multi-channel television. The introduction of MMDS technology and the granting of monopoly licences has led to a situation where many of my constituents are without a service.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure universal availability of service to those people.  Deflector systems which were forced to close down can supply a service which can be brought into action at short notice.  I call on the Government to take appropriate action to rectify this completely unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>In a recent conversation with me, Deputy Michael D. Higgins pointed out a salient fact, namely, that US domination of the audio-visual media has cost the EU 23,000 jobs.  While canvassing in respect of the GATT agreement, US representatives sought to have audio-visual media included under technology rather than culture.</P>
    <P>Having listened to other contributions to the debate, there appears to be general acceptance of the need for a pluralist media.  There are many points of view here.  If one considers the national question, there are two definite points of view and there is a great need to bring them together to allow the country to make progress and move away from past difficulties.</P>
    <P>Minority interests can sometimes be forgotten but, nonetheless, they are very important.  On the initiative of the former Leader of the Labour Party and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, Ireland is in contention with Argentina to host the Special Olympics in 2003. In my opinion areas relating to people with disabilities must be given adequate coverage in the media.  In terms of television, where motivation and profit are the bottom line, areas of this sort are not as attractive as those which boost viewing numbers and attract increased advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>With regard to diversity, I grew up in Waterford at a time when evening newspapers were published daily.  That is no longer the case but in many ways local radio stations have helped to fill <Col N="520" /> the gap.  Putting the question of monopolies to one side, people should not be marginalised or excluded from access to media or to sporting and cultural events.  There is another aspect to this issue.  People who are disadvantaged or on low incomes already experience a general level of exclusion and marginalisation in their lifestyles. If they cannot afford the cost of access to major sporting or cultural events it will have a continuing and dramatic effect on their self-esteem. Building personal self-esteem is a forerunner to true citizenship through which people participate in the system, so to speak, in an informed fashion. They will have confidence in themselves because they consider themselves important.  There are two sides to citizenship &mdash; the rights and responsibilities. We all need to review constantly what is meant by citizenship.  Citizenship requires redefinition as progress is made in technology and communications.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to address an important element in the change from analogue to digital television broadcasting.  Great amounts of money are involved in this change in technology and great amounts of money can be made by it.  It would be in the community's worst interests if commercialisation were to be the determining factor in access to events.</P>
    <P>I understand that since just before the last general election conditions have been ripe for the introduction of legislation to list special events, a list which could be added to as appropriate.  I am bewildered that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to bring forward a Bill.  If the main party in Government still purports to represent the disadvantaged and the poor the delay in legislating is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Higgins departed as Minister, the Department seems to have suffered a general paralysis.  It is incumbent on the Minister to accept this Bill.  She may feel it can be amended but we are approaching the summer recess and there is no sign of a Bill from the Minister on this issue.  Given the speed of change in communications media I am concerned that we will find ourselves constantly trying to catch up with it. The Government is not anticipating change or being active in that regard.</P>
    <P>Members cannot dispute seriously the principles which underlie this Bill.  The Government may seek to be political and not accept an Opposition Bill.  This is a very important issue.  We tend to underestimate how great a role television plays in people's lives.  This issue has caused strong feelings of anger and alienation in my constituency. Many people there do not have a multi-channel television service.</P>
    <P>Monopoly licences were granted to the MMDS service and a monopoly in any field of the media is a bad starting point.  A deflector system was available in many areas which was satisfactory and affordable.  The MMDS service cannot be provided in all areas and it is much more expensive. Many households have more than one television <Col N="521" /> set and with the deflector system one could connect as many television sets as desired to the deflector input.  However, with the MMDS system one needs a separate connection for each television set.  In addition, with the deflector system one could watch one channel while recording another but that is not possible with the MMDS system.</P>
    <P>The situation is an intolerable mess.  My constituents are deprived of a service which was withdrawn due to a court injunction.  The Government has chosen to ignore that; no action is being taken and the problems are being passed to the regulator.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Higgins, for introducing this Bill and stimulating this debate.  I hope the debate will continue outside the House through the media in its various manifestations.  Some of the basic elements of democracy relate to access to the airwaves and the print media.  It is the essence of democracy that people are open to a variety of opinions and information.  If not, we do not have the freedom to make decisions for ourselves, to develop our culture and to achieve our full potential. Debate on these issues is important and positive and decisive actions should be taken as a result of it.</P>
      <P>All parties have stressed the importance of pluralism with regard to the variety of influences to which we are subject via the media.  Those influences are very powerful.  I do not know the average amounts of time spent watching television, listening to radio and reading newspapers or magazines but I am sure it is a large proportion of a person's day and, therefore, constitutes a large proportion of the influences upon that person.</P>
      <P>There is an urgency about this issue of access partly because there is an EU directive to be implemented and partly because of the arrival of digital broadcasting.  However, it is also urgent because there are moves afoot to control the airwaves and to take over many sporting and other events.  People will be denied access because they cannot afford to pay to see the events.  The question of access has been widely debated.  Another side of access that needs to be protected if our culture is to be preserved is access for producers and for creative people, young musicians, writers and artists.  There is such a dominance now, particularly in American culture, that if our own culture is not protected we will all be subjected to outside influences and our own culture will not be appropriately developed.  This is instanced by what has been done about archival material by our national broadcasting service, RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aspects of our culture, of our music and literary heritage, would have been lost forever if we had not had a national broadcasting service and very good broadcasters, particularly on radio, who took the time and trouble, to gather these elements together.  That access has to be extended to those who are being creative now.  Somebody <Col N="522" /> playing music who does not have access to the national or local airwaves will never be able to break through.  That is another aspect of access that I have not heard developed by other speakers.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency not to allow ourselves to be taken over by globalisation of attitudes and culture.  There is an obligation on us to decide to what extent we can and should control that.  We have a tradition of characters and idiosyncrasy, for example, the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> keeping an eye on what was going on in Eastern Europe at the beginning of this century.  We do not have so much of that any more, and it is important that we preserve what we do have in that regard. Local radio and local media have a role in ensuring that cultural differences within the country are preserved and have access to the media.  As Deputy Roche said, there is also an obligation on our national broadcasting service to ensure that it is not too &ldquo;Dublin 4&rdquo; oriented and that various aspects of our culture are incorporated in it.</P>
    <P>I spent a couple of years living on the other side of the Atlantic at the end of the 1970s, and I remember being struck by the sameness of television channels, particularly the American ones. I lived in Canada, and the American channels which were available there were hugely similar. This was a cultural shock.  I realised that, despite the smallness of our country, we had more diversity at that time.  People felt the need to set up public broadcasting in that environment to ensure variety.  There is an obligation on us as legislators to ensure that we do not go down that road.</P>
    <P>The power of the media is huge.  This is evidenced by the fact that throughout history dictators have tended to take over the airwaves and the newspapers when they wanted to control the public.</P>
    <P>Many contributors to this debate have referred to the question of access to important sporting events.  There is a real danger that we will lose access in this area unless we take decisive action quickly.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the fact that this year the World Cup is twice as dear as last time around.  The Kirch company in Germany has bought the rights to the World Cup for the years 2002 and 2006.  To ensure access for European citizens, the European broadcasting body will have to buy back these rights from that company &mdash; already public money has to be used to guarantee equality of access.  It is essential that we move quickly.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry had certain things to say in this regard.  Like Deputy Higgins, they took the view that control of competition should include radio, television, magazines and newspapers.  In his Bill, Deputy Higgins brings the various elements of the media together in terms of controlling dominant positions. I support that approach because if the various elements are separated it would enable the taking of dominant positions which would not benefit anybody.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Roche on the need for diversity <Col N="523" /> of opinion, not just on ownership but in terms of the various people who form opinion &mdash; columnists and opinion-makers on various levels of the media.  Ownership is extremely powerful and any domination will distort people's access to diversity of opinion.  That is something on which we also have to take action.</P>
    <P>Our own national broadcasting company, RTÉ is very much aware of the importance of keeping up-to-date with technology.  It is important that we back it up and do not let it fall behind by not being quick enough to take advantage of the huge opening up that will happen.</P>
    <P>As well as newspapers, magazines, satellite and digital television, cable and MMDS services, Internet service is listed in the Bill in terms of cross-ownership.  We are only beginning to come to terms with the huge influence of the Internet which is bound to grow because it is being so widely used now in a positive way as well as there being the potential for it to be used in a negative way.  I am not competent to say how it can be controlled.  Nevertheless, to the extent that we can have some involvement that will protect us from the negative side of it, that should also be done.</P>
    <P>We live in a globalised world.  In the not so recent past, watching television, one would see differences in style of dress and appearance between various parts of the world and even within this country.  I remember going to school in the city and feeling that I looked like a country girl compared to the city girls.  That is not so now. People from thousands of miles across the globe are wearing the same designer label T-shirts.  In some ways this is inevitable.  However, it is crucial that we preserve our right to be different and give whatever protection we can to those who wish to and who are gifted in developing our own distinctive differences.  One of the most powerful ways in which we can do that is by ensuring the maximum amount of pluralism in terms of access for producers as well as consumers who are watching television, reading newspapers, listening to radio and so on.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have globalisation and on the other subsidiarity.  The two have to be balanced. Things that happen at local level particular to individuals, individual cultures and individual areas, must be protected as well.  I have a horror of all of us having the same attitudes, the same tastes and the same culture.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague on producing this Bill and hope it will be supported.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by the submission of this Bill by Deputy Higgins.  I would have expected an eminent social scientist to provide this opportunity. <Col N="524" /> The fact that the vast majority of people in Ireland are sitting in front of their television sets watching England play Argentina is an indication of the power of the media.</P>
      <P>The way society has developed mirrors the way the media has expanded.  We are moving from a safe, staid, State-controlled broadcasting system, namely, RTE.  Many people believe that was an excellent system which produced and continues to produce some fine material.  How many commercially oriented companies and stations would be prepared to broadcast Cathal O'Shannon's programmes on 1798 or many of the other marginal quality programmes produced over the years?  RTE has provided a sterling service for this country and it continues to do outstanding work.  Under the guardianship of RTE, TnaG has blossomed and developed which proves that there is much in public service broadcasting that needs to be preserved and developed.</P>
      <P>There are opportunities for change, however, and we must examine those.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the way the influences of globalised television quickly permeate Irish society.  From my limited reading of social science during my university days I recall there was a significant timelag between developments in US society and those developments reaching Irish shores, fashion and food being two examples.  It is now clear that whatever is prevalent in the US media will be popular on this side of the Atlantic within a few weeks.</P>
      <P>Many programmes deal with the actualisation of police activities and so on.  Copycat versions of those programmes are now broadcast on commercial radio.  Last night, the Adrian Kennedy programme on FM104, in its attempt to be outrageous now that it has lost Chris Barry, regrettably decided to go to Finglas to meet five or six young men and women who appeared to have a record of anti-social behaviour in that they stole cars, etc.  The programme had a very large audience and, within half an hour or so, at least five stolen cars were being driven recklessly around Finglas.  A police helicopter hovered overhead while the reporter shouted into his mobile phone that the grills were being torn off the windows of the police van.  I spoke to the gardaí this morning and they told me that nobody has been arrested as a result of those incidents.  These type of stations are guilty of the most outrageous manipulation of their audience.  That cannot be countenanced and I utterly condemn it.</P>
      <P>The recently completed internal review of RTE is timely and appropriate.  It refers to the need to shed jobs but I wonder if an internal review of RTE is what is required.  If there is to be a better mix of the commercial and public service ethos, would it not be better for an outside person to carry out an objective assessment of RTE's needs?  I would not like to see RTE submerged in the avalanche of commercialism and digitalisation which is on the horizon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read an interesting article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last week about the advent of TV3 which is <Col N="525" /> targeted both in its audience and in its programming. It is clear that TV3 is aiming at young people with money to spend who will switch from channel to channel and who are prepared to pay. When it comes to paying for television we must bear in mind that not everybody can pay for the cluster of programmes on offer because it is almost impossible to buy one particular channel. One has to buy a certain package but many of the channels in that package may not be of any interest.</P>
    <P>In any legislation the Minister brings forward we must ensure that we preserve the best of what is available while providing the best range of programming to as wide an audience as possible. That must be balanced with the commercial needs of television because we are talking about business.</P>
    <P>I reject Deputy O'Shea's comment that there has been general paralysis in the area of legislation since Deputy Higgins left office.  This debate is important because it provides us with an opportunity to reflect, get our thoughts together and come up with the correct proposal. Future broadcasting legislation will have to stand the test of time.  If it does not, there is little point in introducing it.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot wholeheartedly support Deputy Higgins's Bill.  I compliment him for affording us the opportunity to have a broad debate on the media and television in particular. I trust he will understand that there are other aspects of the debate which he might find are worth including when he has an opportunity to reflect on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with a number of issues which we are all anxious to address, though not in the way specifically outlined by Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>The issue of broadcasting and the media is very important.  We must be careful that we do not interfere in the area of the media beyond ensuring it is not used by any sectional group for its own narrow interests.  The media must be responsive to the people and serve their interests before any other.</P>
      <P>The technological developments in the past number of years complicate matters even further. Anyone trying to place controls on the media must come to terms with the transient nature of these technological developments.  We have hardly taken on board the implications of the latest technological advance before it is swept aside to be replaced by the next generation.  Those who try to introduce legislation in this area must realise that the task has similarities to building a house on shifting sands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us will remember, perhaps with fondness, the old days of broadcasting &mdash; a small black and white set with an aerial capable of picking up one station, our national broadcaster, Telefis Éireann.  Those of us in the Border areas were able to sample the varied delights of BBC and Ulster Television.  We are now faced with the <Col N="526" /> prospect of digital television with dozens of television channels being offered.  We do not know what the implication of this and other technology will be for society or broadcasting itself.</P>
    <P>The first section of Deputy Higgins's Bill seeks to provide legislation to introduce a section of the European Union directive, Television without Frontiers.  As Members are aware, this section of Article 3(a) is an attempt by the European Union to deal with the problem of cheque book television coverage where large media companies which own satellite broadcasting networks buy up the broadcasting rights to important events, especially in the field of sports, thereby denying access to traditional television broadcasters and those who do not subscribe to their respective TV companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's Bill proposes that the Minister draw up a list of events that are to be considered as being of national importance and which the Minister should then seek to protect from prospective poachers.  The Bill does not mention the yardstick and criteria that are to be established for making these decisions.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 15 and 16.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to persuade the Minister to implement the legislation before 3 December l998.  The arguments were covered in detail on Committee Stage and I will not detain the House. The legislation will have gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  I realise the Minister wants to give time for employers and others to implement the legislation in the workplace, but they do not need that length of time.  I urge the Minister to bring the date forward a good deal earlier than 3 December.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I support the thrust of the amendment.  We were very tardy in our obligation on this issue.  We missed the deadline and had to seek an extension of time.  We are at the tail of the field on fundamental legislation which underpins the right of both parents to avail of parental leave.  Given that paid parental leave is not enshrined in the Bill, we should at least avail of the maximum time options and scope provided.  I fully endorse the thrust of the amendment and ask the Minister to be as receptive and sympathetic as possible to it.</P>

      <P>Deputies O'Sullivan and Higgins favour conferring on employees the right to parental leave immediately the Bill becomes law, but that is not the whole picture.  The position of employers must be taken on board.  As I <Col N="527" /> explained on Second Stage and at the select committee, consideration of the views of ICTU and IBEC on this led to the inclusion in the Bill of this subsection which fixes 3 December 1998 as the date the Bill will come into operation.</P>
      <P>The directive is flexible in nature.  This means employers cannot draw on the basic framework in the directive to prepare for parental leave. Until the Bill is enacted the details of the scheme are not certain.  Deferral of implementation of the scheme until December would allow employer organisations to provide information for their members, enable systems to be put in place for the operation of the scheme, enable regulations to be made, allow for reconciliation of the parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> schemes with existing non-statutory schemes of special leave and generally permit the smooth introduction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It would be impractical to have such an initiative brought into effect as proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan and supported by Deputy O'Higgins. The operative date of 3 December is in full compliance with the terms of the directive.  The European Commission has confirmed that the deferral sought by Ireland fully accords with the relevant clause of the directive which permits additional time to a member state to implement the directive in case of special difficulties.</P>

      <P>Obviously the legislation cannot be implemented on the original proposed date, 3 June, but I am disappointed the Minister will not implement it sooner than 3 December.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 33 to 38, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each such regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I reintroduce this issue because it is good practice that needs to be laid down in all legislation.  It is not right that regulations are brought into play, which may have significance in terms of Bills passed into law, without a fully accountable system to ensure issues of contention can be dealt with in time by Members before they are approved and passed.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point on Committee Stage that regulations in this Bill may not be contentious, but I have raised this matter on other Bills in the area of agriculture and other areas because we must ensure a principle of good practice is imposed in terms of the work we do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> To presume the present methodology is always the correct and best one is unacceptable.  We must always continue to improve matters.  That we will debate a Bill on Thursday which we have not seen yet is an example of how the rules of this House do not always work in the best service of the people.</P>
    <P>In this instance regulations can have enormous import and as a matter of course there should be checks on balances as I suggest.  If there are other checks and balances that meet the same criteria I have no problem with that, but not to deal with the matter in a fashion that will ensure accountability is an opportunity missed.  We should establish best practice at all possible opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I agree with Deputy McManus if we are to introduce regulations which are directly related to the Bill, it is good practice and in accordance with democratic principles that the measures should be brought before the House for debate and endorsement.  We have already gone the road of divesting ourselves, to our cost, in terms of a series of decisions that were once the remit of this House where questions could be legitimately posed and answered. For example, we cannot ask questions on the workings of Telecom Éireann because we hived off that operation to a stand-alone organisation. Although it is directly answerable to the Minister, we cannot ask direct questions about Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>Similarly with national primary and national secondary roads, the workings of the National Roads Authority are a matter for the Minister and that authority and there is a problem in terms of the right of Members to ask questions on the matter.  The same applies with An Post, CIE, Bus Éireann and so on.  When introducing regulations that arise directly from or are related to the legislation, it is right and proper that those regulations should be laid before the House and Members should have the right to comment on, observe or endorse them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations as envisaged under this Bill are clearly secondary legislation. The distinction between primary and secondary legislation is a long-standing one.  Only the Oireachtas can enact primary legislation.  Thus the policy element of primary legislation is what is reflected in the Bill which is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On the other hand ministerial regulations involve administrative issues.  The power to make ministerial regulations draws on the policy principles enunciated in the Bill.  The various provisions which empower the Minister to make regulations are fully within the principles I have just stated while being empowered under the Bill to make regulations in regard to a matter such as the particulars to be stated in a notice to a rights commissioner, section 18; the method of calculation of the amount of compensation to an employer that may be awarded by a rights commissioner, section 21, and the standard <Col N="529" /> format of records of parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave to be kept by employers.  There is also an explicit requirement in the Bill before making any regulations that there should be prior consultation with employer and employee interests.  This is provided for in section 3(4).  As I indicated on Committee Stage, I see no need for matters such as those I outlined which do not encompass any substantial policy angle to be submitted for the prior approval of each House. Should some unusual circumstances lead either House to conclude the particular ministerial regulation was <i>ultra vires</i> this Act, it is open to the Members of either House to invoke the procedure in section 3(4) which enables a regulation to be annulled.</P>
      <P>Up until 15 years ago, a Seanad committee reviewed Statutory Instruments, but when the new committee system was put in place a committee was not set up to look at them.  There is merit in the arguments of Deputies McManus and Higgins regarding the powers of the Oireachtas in this respect, but it is a matter for the party Whips which should properly be discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to ascertain whether we should in future have a committee looking at regulations and making suggestions about them.  I do not have any objection to such a committee if that is desired by Members.  The place to take that up is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and it would be useful for Deputies to initiate a discussion on the merits of such a committee.  It is certain that if the committee gets up and running it will not become overheated or overexcited in regard to the regulations which will be made under this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not presume too much.  I accept the Minister made a valuable point, although I suspect the original committee looked at Statutory Instruments after they were made rather than before.  The proposal is that they would be drafted and then approved by the House.  My proposal is better in terms of ensuring the regulations are considered fully.  Not all wisdom lies within the Department, although I have great respect for the people who work there.  We have seen regulations challenged in the courts and this is an example of where a practical beneficial outcome is possible if there is closer scrutiny by Opposition Members whose job is to look for faults and weaknesses.  It is a pity the Minister has not taken the step forward in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> In page 6, line 11, after &ldquo;adoptive parent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or an employee who is <i>in loco parentis</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised in amendments tabled by the ICTU which we did not have in time to table on Committee Stage.  Deputy Barnes flagged this on Committee Stage.  I accept <i>&ldquo;in loco parentis</i>&rdquo; is included in regard to <i>force majeure</i> leave and it is important in that regard.  However, there may be a small number of situations where a person would be <i>in loco parentis</i> for a long time during a child's infancy.  I accept that tabling the amendment on Report Stage may not be the most effective way to proceed, but I wanted to signal that there may be a small number of cases where a person is <i>in loco parentis</i> for a long time.  For example, in a tragic situation where a parent dies, there may be people who would have a genuine need to take parental leave in the interest of the child.  I hope the Minister examines the issue.  It is important and perhaps it should have been more widely considered at an earlier stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The complexity of the issues arising from the amendment belie its apparent simplicity.  When the Bill was developed careful consideration was given to defining the parents who would be entitled to parental leave.  It was decided to confine eligibility to natural or adoptive parents because to do otherwise would create major practical and legal difficulties.  I am not sure how the Deputy envisages this provision working in practice.  Any number of situations could arise in which someone is <i>in loco parentis</i> and each presents its own unique difficulties.  It is not clear whether under the proposed legislation the right to parental leave would apply to a person <i>in loco parentis</i> and to the natural or adoptive parent of the child.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy envisage that several people would be entitled to parental leave in respect of the same child?  If the Deputy does not intend to give a multiple right to parental leave in respect of the one child, does she intend to deprive the natural parent of the right to parental leave?  If so, what criteria would be used to decide this? To attempt to deny a natural parent the right to parental leave or extending such a right to another person would entail significant constitutional, legal and practical difficulty.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty relates to the steps which must be taken by the employer to establish whether an employer or an employee is acting <i>in loco parentis.</i>  It should be borne in mind that in this context it will fall on the employer, not the courts, in the first instance to determine whether to grant leave to the applicant.  The proposed amendment would put the employer in an uncertain position in deciding the granting of parental leave.  Given the difficulties presented by the amendment and the complexities of the issues involved, I will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We debated this on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow for a longer period of parental leave than that provided for in the Bill by substituting 18 for 14 working weeks. It proposes to give a greater amount of time off to parents where they feel it is in the best interests of their children for them to be at home rather than at work.  There may be many situations where a parent would be torn between the needs of the child and those of the workplace. The purpose of the amendment is to give broader scope in the Bill and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I support the thrust of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  I do not know why when we introduce measures such as this, which was anticipated with bated breath for a considerable time, we should always go for the minimalist approach.  We do whatever we do and at the same time characterise it as a grudging concession rather than a right.  It is only when one examines the comparisons with other countries that one realises how minimalist is the approach. For example, the Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, are among the most generous in terms of provisions for working parents.  Danish mothers can get up to one year's parental leave if their children are under the age of eight and 60 per cent of the rate of unemployment benefit is payable.  In Finland, either parent is entitled to 158 days' parental leave over and above maternity leave, for which special parents' allowance is paid.  In Belgium there is a system of career breaks which can range from six months to five years, when parents receive an allowance corresponding to unemployment benefit.  Yet here we are not able to concede any social welfare concession other than the standard maternity benefit.  There is no question of payment involved, except in the unlikely event of it being offered.</P>
      <P>What we are offering is minimalist by comparison with other countries.  Employers will say that from the point of view of economic competitiveness they need to be as tight and competitive as possible.  Nobody could seriously suggest that either the Danish, the Swedish, the Finnish or the Belgian economies lag behind our economy.  Our economy has improved in considerable measure in recent years but these are successful economies too.  The economic argument that we are making ourselves less competitive simply does not stand up.  These other countries have very tolerable, flexible, understanding regimes and are in no way disadvantaged as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was well made on Committee Stage <Col N="532" /> that by introducing a flexible, tolerant regime we could enhance the relationship in the workplace between the employer and employee.  This would help the employee to build a positive attitude towards the employer while, at the same time, employer and employee would manage, collectively, to produce a much better return in terms of economic results.  I am sorry that on the request for a mere four weeks' unpaid parental leave there is no indication the Minister has changed his mind since the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept these amendments.  The parental leave directive stipulates a minimum entitlement of three months' parental leave.  Bearing in mind the novelty of parental leave in this country the duration of the leave is set at 14 weeks.  There is already a statutory entitlement to 14 weeks' maternity leave, as well as four weeks' additional maternity leave.  The parental leave will be added to the existing entitlements.  As the Bill stands where both parents are eligible for parental leave they can, between them, have 28 weeks for each child.</P>
      <P>My Department has received many submissions from interested individuals and organisations about the Bill.  My officials and I have consulted representatives of both employers and unions in developing the provisions of the Bill. As indicated to the select committee, I have met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation since the Bill was initiated.</P>
      <P>As indicated, the Bill complies with the requirement of the directive in respect of the duration of parental leave.  I said on Second Stage that the scheme of parental leave had been developed from scratch.  Deputy O'Sullivan seems to suggest it was, therefore, open to me to arbitrarily select a figure higher than 14 weeks as the maximum duration of parental leave and to impose it on employers.  Doubtless such a move would be welcomed by some working parents.  On the other hand I am certain employers would not share the zeal of Deputies O'Sullivan and Higgins and would have opposed any such zeal on my part because effectively I would be going beyond the requirements of the directive.</P>
      <P>My objective is to achieve a balance between the needs of employers to manage their businesses and the aim of putting in place a satisfactory scheme of parental leave.  I reject the claim that the Bill is minimalist.  It is not and I have outlined the reasons on numerous occasions.  I have pointed out the provisions in the Bill where I have exercised my discretion pursuant to the directive in an imaginative way.  In the circumstances and given the views of all parties I consider that the period of 14 weeks' parental leave strikes the right balance.</P>

      <P>I am seeking to ensure that all children, whether the upper age is five years or eight years, are covered under the legislation.  All children under that age should be covered by the legislation in relation to parental leave.  Subsection (2) excludes children born before 3 June 1996.  In effect it excludes a sizeable number of children in the State who would otherwise be covered by the legislation by virtue of being under the maximum age.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>This subsection is out of step with the legislation. On the one hand the Minister is saying the parents of all children under five years of age are entitled to parental leave and on the other he is saying that those born before 3 June 1996 are not entitled to parental leave.  This is not consistent. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has serious concerns with regard to this aspect of the Bill because it was one of the parties which negotiated the framework agreement with employers at a European level.  In its interpretation, this subsection goes against what was negotiated.  In that context the Minister should give serious consideration to accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Essentially, my amendment seeks to do the same.  The reality is that in introducing this measure only the parents of children up to two and half years of age will qualify. Children born on or before 3 June 1996 do not qualify.  Effectively parents have been shortchanged and there was no indication this would be introduced.  The Minister, in defence of the provisions of the Bill, said there is a need for a run in period.  I acknowledge that if one accepts the thrust of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment or mine, it would increase the number of parents who would qualify.  This Bill is not so much about parents but about children: their rights and entitlement to the protection, care and nurturing of their parents in their home at a time when they are at their most sensitive and when key developments are taking place in relation to their emotions.  There is a need to provide the maximum degree of contact on a one to one basis between parents and children.  What we are seeking is to broaden the scope of the Bill from the point of view of the number of parents and children who will qualify and benefit from it.  It is a simple, modest provision and I cannot see why <Col N="534" /> this cannot be done as a gesture to the Opposition and to parents and children, because there is no cost involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this would produce disruption for employers but neither the Bill nor the directive fell out of a clear blue sky &mdash; they were well flagged in advance. If ICTU knew about it, so did IBEC and ISME.  Individual employers knew this was coming and were aware of the basic thrust and tenets of the legislation, so there should be no surprise.  There is already a cushion in the form of the run-in period, because this will not come into force for six months.  There will not be a great rush to avail of this because it takes a certain amount of time for people to become aware of the rights, the practice and the procedures. Why can the Minister not make a modest concession in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the amendment. The directive on parental leave does not specify any form of retrospection.  The amendment would mean that, on the passing of the Bill, all parents with children up to the age of five would become eligible for parental leave.  Parents of children now aged three or four would seek to take their leave before their child reaches the age of five, which would mean a large demand for parental leave in the initial years of the scheme's operation.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on Second and Committee Stages the strong views put forward by IBEC that there should not be any form of retrospection.  On the other hand, the ICTU has argued that the directive entails eligibility for all children up to the age limit fixed by the member state.  I am satisfied the directive does not oblige Ireland to provide for retrospection.  We therefore had to balance employers' concerns about the backlog which would be created if full retrospection was granted against the expectations of parents with young children, and decided parental leave should be given to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996, the date the directive was adopted. This is a workable compromise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the same point &mdash; Deputy O'Sullivan and I are seeking that parents of children up to the age of eight will qualify for parental leave. <Col N="535" /> It should be considered but unfortunately, given the Minister's inflexibility and intransigence on Committee Stage and now, we are not optimistic. One would be extremely tempted to push this to a vote, if it were not being taken tonight.</P>
    <P>It is bewildering that a minimal concession like this could not be made.  Parents will look with envy at what is allowed in other countries &mdash; I will not go through the various regimes &mdash; while we cannot make a concession.  The Minister has not agreed to extend the leave period from 14 to 18 weeks and on Committee Stage he refused to allow parents of children up to age eight to qualify for this leave.  This is disappointing and, to repeat Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks, I hope that when the legislation is reviewed in two years we will see the folly of our ways and there will be no undue disruption to the commercial interests of people who, in their <i>tété-a -tétes</i> with the Minister, determined that we should go thus far and no further.</P>

      <P>I also urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  As Deputy Higgins said, we have already seen that the Minister will not apply the Bill to children born before 3 June 1996 and the leave period will not be extended from 14 to 18 weeks, but I ask the Minister to take this proposal on board.  The directive mentions the age of eight and I am sure the collective wisdom of those who formulated it was that this was the appropriate age.  We have had many representations from parents of children aged between five and eight who wish to take parental leave in the interests of their children.  Will the Minister consider accepting the amendment?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I cannot.  It was possible under the terms of the directive to set the upper age limit anywhere between two and eight.  If the Government wished to do only the minimum required by the directive it could have fixed a lower age limit, but we decided against this.  There appears to be a misconception that eight years is the EU norm but only two member states, Sweden and Denmark, have such an upper limit, with most setting it at three years. We decided on five years, by which age almost all children have started school.  This strikes a fair balance.</P>

    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to define the scope of an employer's power to postpone parental leave.  Their effect is that an employer is entitled to postpone the start of parental leave to a time within six months of the start date requested by the employee, but the employer and employee must agree the new start date.  The notice of postponement must state the reasons for postponement.</P>
    <P>An employer may only postpone the commencement of parental leave or a period thereof under section 7(1)(b) once or, if the proposal is because of seasonal variations in work, twice. This will ensure that an employer cannot postpone leave indefinitely.  The reasons that leave postponed for seasonal variations is treated differently from that postponed for other reasons is to avoid having an employee making an application for parental leave in one year, knowing it will be refused for seasonal reasons, then making a further application for leave at the same time in the following year in the certain knowledge it will be granted.</P>
    <P>I consider Deputy McManus' amendment to be adequately addressed in amendment No. 12 and therefore do not propose to accept it, but I acknowledge that the point was well made by her on Committee Stage and I trust it has been addressed to her satisfaction.

The Minister has been willing to take on board certain arguments, although there are instances where we would disagree.  It is good that improvements have been made as a result of Opposition amendments and I thank the Minister for it.</P>
      <P>This is an improvement which covers various aspects of an employer blocking a parent from receiving an entitlement and ensures in as far as is practicable that an employer cannot abuse that power.  I hope that is the end result.  I presume sections 3 and 4 will become sections 5 and 6 and that those subsections will be maintained.</P>

A person with whom the employee is living is a very loose term and could encompass a range of persons who happen to be living under the one roof.  The term &ldquo;living together&rdquo; could be applied to flatmates or house sharers.  It could refer to an <i>au pair</i>, someone in digs or even a servant, although such an instance is rare.  It might even include a long stay visitor to the house.</P>

      <P>It would be unwise to have such an imprecise and open-ended provision in legislation which could give rise to considerable conflict.

    <P>The amendment is self-explanatory and shortens the period of notification to the rights commissioner from six months to one month.  I am not saying that a one month period is the answer, but six months seems to be a relatively long period. <Col N="540" /></P>

      <P>When section 18 was considered on Committee Stage, I introduced an amendment to increase the figure of three months.  An identical amendment was put down by Deputy McManus.  Deputy Higgins has proposed that the figure in the section should be one month.  The subsection is concerned with the time within which an employee must avail of the procedure permitting reference to a rights commissioner of disputes about entitlement to parental leave which may arise between an employer and an employee.</P>
      <P>The timeframe of six months proposed in the Bill is consistent with other equality and employment legislation.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment as it would confine the employee to a very restricted timeframe in which to bring a case to a rights commissioner.  A timescale of one month would be unfavourable to an employee who, before entering a formal dispute process with his or her employer, might wish to consult his or her union representatives, the employment equality agency, or might wish to take legal advice.</P>
      <P>Having a deadline of merely a month to tease out such matters might cause the employee to initiate the referral process in some haste before the dust has settled on the dispute.  Taking these factors into account, it is preferable that the Parental Leave Bill should remain in line with other equality and employment legislation where a six months' timeframe is the norm for reference to a rights commissioner.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept Deputy Higgins's amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who contributed to the debate on all Stages.  The purpose of the Bill is to implement a Council directive on parental leave dated 3 June 1996.  Enactment of this legislation also fulfils a commitment in the Partnership 2000 agreement that legislation would be introduced by June 1998 to give effect to the terms of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents a milestone in Irish working life.  It introduces a statutory scheme of parental leave for the first time and, as such, is pioneering legislation.  Many members referred to the fact that parental leave will be unpaid.  For the reasons I have outlined, I have not provided for paid leave.  Since the Bill was published it has attracted strong reaction.  Some have criticised it as being mean spirited while others claim it is too generous.  My approach in developing the legislation was to achieve a balance between the needs of employers to manage their businesses and putting in place a satisfactory scheme of parental leave.  I am confident I have struck the correct balance in the Bill.  When I spoke on Second Stage I quoted several statistics which illustrate <Col N="541" /> the marked change in the country's workforce in recent years.  The statistics paint a picture of Irish society for whom availability of parental leave will be highly relevant.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of the parental leave directive are the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal opportunities and treatment between men and women.  The parental leave Bill represents a landmark in putting these objectives in place.  The enactment into legislation of the directive is keenly awaited.  This is evident from the many parents who contacted my Department in recent weeks seeking information about it.</P>
    <P>The necessary steps for implementing the legislation will be commenced in the coming weeks by my Department.  I hope I can look forward to the continued co-operation of ICTU and IBEC when preparing the regulations under the Bill.  I thank them for their contribution to the legislation.  I am also very grateful to Deputies for their wide range of views and I thank them for affording a speedy passage to this truly historic legislation.  I also sincerely thank the officials in my Department who worked extremely hard in preparing the legislation and who were of tremendous assistance throughout.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I join the Minister in paying tribute to the officials who have done tremendous work in drafting the legislation.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister in respect of the significance of the Bill.  We are introducing another measure along the road towards combining work and family life and the compatibility of one with the other.  The crucial role of the family in society must be underpinned and I have no doubt this measure is a gesture in that regard.</P>
      <P>I hope attitudes will have thawed, particularly those of employers and the Government, before the review takes place in two years' time.  As I stated on Second and Committee Stages, the workability of the legislation will depend on whether people can be released from the economic compulsion and the realities of daily life, namely, putting bread on the table, paying the mortgage, the banks and building societies. Unfortunately, I was not allowed move an amendment to double child benefit.  It was a minimalist approach that simply sought to increase the benefit from £1 to £2 per day.  It would have been a gesture of solidarity with parents who, through economic compulsion, will not be able to avail of parental leave.  However, we might be pleasantly surprised.  The uptake might be more significant than we think.  In the absence of some financial support, however, it will be extremely difficult for this measure to achieve the potential it offers to family life.</P>

      <P>I welcome this positive step on parental leave.  Obviously, I would have preferred if some aspects of the legislation were changed and, like Deputy Higgins, I hope they will be considered in the review.  When employers see how <Col N="542" /> this measure benefits workers, they will realise that an even more generous interpretation of the directive would benefit the workplace as well as the family.  I hope there will be a large take-up of the leave and that the public is properly informed of its existence.</P>
      <P>Deletion of the words &ldquo;without pay&rdquo; will not only allow generous employers pay employees for the leave, it will also enable the Minister and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to consider the possibility of providing funding for families who could not otherwise afford to take parental leave.  I thank the Minister for accepting a number of the amendments and welcome this historic legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank the Minister and his officials for the work they have done on this Bill, but it is still a matter of unfinished business. Until we have paid parental leave, even though this measure will be written into law as a matter of right, parental leave will simply be a privilege for those who can afford to avail of it.  For many on low incomes, particularly young families who will want to avail of this measure, it will be beyond their capability.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;unpaid leave&rdquo; is at least a signal that it is unfinished business.  It also reinforces the idea that we are willing to take from Europe, but do not always apply general European standards.  This Bill shows that while we may be good Europeans, we are not yet great Europeans.  We need to move forward in terms of social reform so that all the people to whom this measure applies can benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House and, in particular, the Opposition Front Bench for us being able to take this legislation rather late at night.  I understand the same facility will be afforded tomorrow evening.  I thank them for facilitating us.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, the business the Department of Defence has been dominated by the loss of hearing claims.  Having regard to the huge financial implications for the taxpayer and the actual and potential damage to the Defence Forces arising from the claims, it remains the major priority issue for the Department.  However, it is important to bear in mind that there are many other very important, positive developments taking place in the area.</P>
      <P>One of the key developments currently taking place is the reorganisation of the Defence Forces. This is not something that is happening in Ireland alone.  With the changing international environment, most countries are taking a hard look at their defence forces and the requirements for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Arising from the changed international environment, the Government decided on 27 April 1993 that an up-to-date statement of roles for the Defence Forces should be drawn up and that, based on that revised statement, a radical overhaul of the Defence Forces should be undertaken under the aegis of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG).  The revised statement of roles was approved by Government on 21 September 1993.</P>
    <P>On 3 July 1995, the then Government approved in principle the conclusions of the EAG &mdash; on foot of a detailed study undertaken by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants &mdash; on the need for major reform of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  The Government also decided to establish an implementation group to prepare a fully costed implementation plan which would detail the action to be taken over the following three years and which would be broadly compatible with the recommendations of the EAG.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan was subsequently approved by Government on 5 March 1996.  It is important to point out that the implementation plan has the full backing of the military authorities.  The implementation plan is the first part of the ongoing reform of the Defence Forces, which is expected to last ten years.  The Defence White Paper will play an important part in setting the scene for future reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Some of the major reforms being carried out as a result of the Defence Forces review implementation plan, 1996-1998, involve the reorganisation of the Defence Forces from a four command structure to a three brigade structure and an enhanced organisational and operational capability through larger unit sizes.  There will be nine larger infantry battalions instead of the current 11 and there will be less top-heavy structures in place; a reduced manpower level to 11,500 and lower age profiles; and new career structures for officers and enlisted personnel.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the main purpose of the implementation plan is to increase the teeth to tail ratio in the Defence Forces, to cut out layers of unnecessary administration and to have more troops available for operational duties.</P>
    <P>One of the other recommendations contained in the implementation plan provides for the revision of the range of statutory duties of the Chief of Staff &mdash; in particular to give a new emphasis and focus to his responsibility for the effectiveness, efficiency, military organisation and economy of the Defence Forces &mdash; and the allocation of the duties of the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General to two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff, one with responsibility for operational matters and the second for support matters.  Having one person at the helm of the Defence Forces makes for a more streamlined management system.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give legislative effect to these recommendations.  The unique structure of primary <Col N="544" /> and secondary legislation governing the Defence Forces also forms part of the background to the Bill.  Based on the 1954 Defence Act and supplemented by an extensive set of Defence Force regulations, the purpose of this legal structure is to facilitate the Minister's control and regulate the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps in every detail.  However, in many ways, the 1954 Act reflects the priorities and concerns of another age with a major emphasis on procedural detail.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces in recent years, a major effort has been devoted to blowing away the administrative cobwebs.  Instead of formal regulation, many matters are now dealt with by simple administrative instructions issued by the military authorities, enabling a more creative and flexible approach to management.  However, in the area of organisation, this effort has been stymied by the inflexibility of the 1954 Act with regard to organisation.  At present, as Minister I am obliged to specify, by regulation, each and every appointment in each and every unit of the Defence Forces. Every time personnel are moved around, in theory I should make yet another amendment to the regulation, which is already a thick volume known as CS 4.</P>
    <P>The Bill will introduce two major innovations in military management.  Firstly, it will put in place a modern management structure along the lines outlined above as suggested by the EAG. Secondly, it will empower that management structure with the flexibility to manage effectively the manpower resources of the Defence Forces by removing the requirement for a major body of regulations.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the Strategic Management Initiative there has been a greater focus throughout the public service on clarifying lines of authority and accountability and on specifying clearly the objectives to be met.  Clearly, the vesting of authority in senior public service managers must be balanced against the need to ensure that the position of the elected Government is not in any way eroded.</P>
    <P>The organisational changes proposed in this Bill are grounded in this balanced approach. Where before there where three quasi-independent offices, now there will be a single integrated military headquarters with a single officer clearly in charge.  The Bill also reflects the provisions of the Defence Forces review implementation plan adopted by the previous Government.  Military command of the Defence Forces will remain with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Bill is technical in nature.  In the course of its preparation many different issues concerning both the new management structure and the new approach to regulating the military organisation were raised.  Senior military personnel have been intimately involved in this process and many of their suggestions have been incorporated in the Bill.  In addressing all these issues, the expert advice of the parliamentary draughtsman's office has determined our approach.  I <Col N="545" /> would like to record my appreciation for its considerable assistance in clarifying many difficult legal issues where a layman might easily be led astray.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Defence Act, 1954, are the principal sections being amended.  Section 12 of the 1954 Act provides for three principal military office holders and prescribes the terms and conditions attaching to these three appointments.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the 1954 Act establishes in the Department of Defence three principal military branches, the heads of which are the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. Under the terms of the Act, the Minister for Defence has assigned to each of them specified duties relating to the business of the Department of Defence.  Each is directly responsible for and reports to the Minister on the performance of those duties.  In addition. a co-ordinating role in relation to the business of the principal military branches of the Department has been delegated to the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the implementation plan, the Bill provides that the existing three military branches of the Department of Defence will be replaced by a single military element to be known as Defence Forces Headquarters.  The Chief of Staff will be the head of Defence Forces Headquarters and will be supported by the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff, one dealing with operational matters and the other with support matters.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff will, as heretofore, be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  He will be given the full range of duties heretofore assigned to the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. He will have responsibility for the overall management of the Defence Forces.  The Deputy Chiefs of Staff, who will be appointed by the Government and to whom duties will be delegated by the Chief of Staff with the approval of the Minister, will report to the Chief of Staff and not directly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Amendment Bill provides for the recommended designations and for the reorganisation of the duties of the existing three principal military office holders, for smooth transitional arrangements and for adaptations.  The remaining sections of the Bill involve relatively minor changes and mainly provide for the replacement of the existing appointments of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General with the appointments of Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) or Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), as the case may be.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the changes proposed in this Bill follow from the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces in 1994.  Since the adoption of the three year implementation plan in 1996, an excellent start has been made in rectifying the many deficiencies identified in the consultants' report.  Through a voluntary early retirement scheme costing nearly £50 million, we have achieved a strength of 11,500.  There has been <Col N="546" /> substantial progress in reducing the number of medically unfit personnel.  We have introduced a policy of continuous recruitment and a new manpower policy for enlisted personnel.  In the case of officer promotions, progress has been made to a more merit based system.</P>
    <P>Although these achievements represent major milestones along the path of reform, we must be mindful of the need to underpin our recent successes through longer term reform in the management structures.  The present top level structure of the Defence Forces was designed to meet the needs of a bygone era.  It was deliberately devised to ensure that no single military officer could exercise excessive authority and undermine the position of the Minister.  Accordingly, each of the three autonomous branches was headed by an independent office holder reporting to the Minister with the Chief of Staff confined to exercising an unspecified co-ordinating role.  However, while the command and management structures of the Defence Forces must be consistent with maintaining civil control of the military, we must also have regard to good management practices in the modern age.</P>
    <P>In the course of its 1994 report, Price Waterhouse emphasised the importance of developing and strengthening a professional management ethos in the Defence Forces with a greater focus on the efficient and effective use of resources.  In this context, the consultants highlighted the unusually cumbersome arrangements at headquarters where three nominally independent office holders report separately to the Minister. When this matter came before the then Government, a more conventional and centralised approach was endorsed with a single officer, the Chief of Staff, to be empowered to act as a chief executive.  That approach has been adopted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Defence Forces face many challenges.  We are, both nationally and internationally, facing momentous changes in the security landscape.  That means there must be a process of adjustment and change and new management structures for the Defence Forces.  This Bill begins to address that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need new management structures in the Defence Forces and a new vision of their role in the millennium.  We need to be clear about their military requirements and the range of other roles the Defence Forces will undertake and we must be willing to support them.  If we want a comprehensive, rather than a piecemeal, discussion on the future of the Defence Forces, it <Col N="547" /> is absolutely essential that the Price Waterhouse report on the Naval Service and Air Corps is published immediately.  The Minister also needs to publish the White Paper which he promised to do on taking office but which he has not yet done.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Air Corps is in decline and facing an uncertain future.  There is serious underfunding in the Naval Service as well.  The Army has been waiting for this legislation which was recommended by the Price Waterhouse report and the EAG's report.  However, the deafness compensation controversy and the way it has been handled has seriously undermined the Defence Forces and left them open to ridicule.  It is worth noting that the Judiciary is independent. We are discussing this Bill against a background of deep uncertainty about how these issues will play out in the courts and the final cost to the Exchequer.  It is questionable whether the deafness compensation issue can be resolved in the courts.  If the impact on the economy is approximately £1 billion, as has been stated, then serious political decisions will have to be taken on how the issue is managed and alternative solutions put in place.</P>
    <P>I condemn the various spins put on a number of individual cases in the newspapers.  While it was inevitable that a claim of this size would attract huge attention, some of the reporting of various court cases and the misinformation given from whatever source have been damaging and have not helped the morale of the Defence Forces. It is against that backdrop that we are discussing this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is clear the solution to the problem will be part medical, part legal, part military and part civil.  We must try to find a solution and there must be further consultation with all concerned. The issue must be addressed on a comprehensive basis which is fair to the taxpayer and the individual claimants who have a right to go to court.  It is unfortunate that the Army should find itself alienated from the people, particularly as it has developed a good reputation over the years.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there is a need for comprehensive planning as we move towards the millennium. The deafness compensation issue has made this all the more urgent.  This overview is essential if we are to have the efficient, mobile and effective Defence Forces envisaged in the reports.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have a key role to play internationally given our experience of peace-keeping and the range of services provided in the non-military services area.  However, if we are to continue to play a role in peacekeeping and peace enforcement as we have done in the past, we must provide the necessary training, equipment and opportunities.  It is important that we do not fall behind in this area given our expertise and the great potential we have to contribute to this changing international landscape where peace enforcement will be the key.</P>
    <P>Our Defence Forces are also involved in fishery protection, providing aid to the civil power, <Col N="548" /> tackling the importation of drugs and in search and rescue.  This State has the second largest but most poorly policed sea area in Europe.  Environmental pollution is a serious problem.  The Defence Forces have a role to play in this area which we must prioritise more than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>We must ask how staff can be attracted to the Naval Service or the Air Corps where there is much uncertainty, underfunding and lack of planning for the future.  The Price Waterhouse report must be published and we must draft an implementation plan based on that if we do not want these services to deteriorate.  Overriding all this is the definition of the military requirement of the Defence Forces in the new millennium.  I regret the Minister has missed an opportunity to introduce a comprehensive Defence (Amendment) Bill to this House.  Major administrative issues cannot be dealt with until this report is published and available for debate and discussion.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that deputy Chiefs of Staff will not be appointed by the President.  I ask the Minister to outline to the House the reason for this change and I hope he will be able to do so on Committee Stage tomorrow.  I ask him to reconsider it before it is passed in the House.  It is appropriate that senior members of the Defence Forces are appointed by the President.  This recognises the special role of the Defence Forces and their status in the country.</P>
    <P>The changes outlined in the Bill have been recommended in the Price Waterhouse report and the EAG's report.  We need more streamlined management in the Defence Forces which is what this Bill is attempting.  However, there is a need to establish a headquarters for the different wings of the Defence Forces if we are to plan properly for an effective and efficient Defence Forces.  More senior personnel from the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be involved in the headquarters of the Defence Forces.  The Minister should address this issue.</P>
    <P>It is equally clear, among the other administrative changes that need to be made, that each of these services should have overall control of their budgets.  When I meet members of the Defence Forces they tell me they are extremely irritated by the lack of discretion they have to plan within their own areas at a budget or administrative level.  I welcome section 5 which is an important part of this legislation.  It takes away the oppression of very detailed regulations which, as the Minister said, were perhaps more appropriate at another time, but are not appropriate now.  It is important that decision-making should be at a more local level and there is more flexibility for people to respond to changing needs in the forces. The legislation does not address the question of a single military commander for the Defence Forces.  My colleague, Deputy Timmins, will address this issue further.  The original report comments on that and makes some recommendations which this legislation does not address.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify how the <Col N="549" /> Public Service Management Act, 1997, interacts with the provisions of this Bill.  It would be helpful if the Minister spelt out the authority held by the Secretary General of the Department.  If the Minister for Defence has a statutory role and cannot delegate other than to military officers in command of the Defence Forces, in the absence of an amendment will he outline in detail the control that is vested in the Secretary General of his Department?  Is there a danger the Public Service Management Act unwittingly unravels other statutory provisions in place in regard to the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the reorganisation of top level structures of the Defence Forces.  I oppose the reduction in status and the attempt to make it easier for a Government to terminate appointments of the deputy chiefs of staff and the departure from appointment by the President.  Will the Minister clarify if the new deputy chiefs of staff will be members of the Council of Defence?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the studies done and from what members of the forces are saying that undoubtedly substantial reform is still necessary.  This Bill moves in that direction, but the question of the allocation of resources to the Defence Forces also needs to be addressed.  This is a time of great change for the Defence Forces and yet there is a great opportunity for them to carry out the range of services I addressed earlier, but that will take planning, the implementation of the recommendations of the implementation report and whatever emerges from the Price Waterhouse review of the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The changes the Bill recommends will be welcomed by the Defence Forces with the exceptions I mentioned.  There will be concerns about some of those changes and they should be discussed further in committee.  This is part of what needs to be done in planning for the future of the Defence Forces, but there are many outstanding challenges that need to be addressed if we are to move into the new millennium with Defence Forces which have the capacity, resources and ability to carry out the tasks we want them to carry out in an efficient and effective way.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of the <i>status quo</i>.  The present position is unsatisfactory.  I am in favour of change and a culture of change, but I am not in favour of change for the sake of change.  It is wasteful of resources, time, human effort and leadership and it would result in a further erosion of morale and is damaging.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states the Bill's main purpose is to amend the Defence Act, 1954, to give legislative effect to the reorganisation of the top level structure of the Defence Forces.  A good deal of time, effort and study has been put into examining how best the Defence Forces might move forward.  There is very little conflict between all the reports in that they recognise that major change is required as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse review of the Defence <Col N="550" /> Forces states that the extent of change required is quite mammoth in proportions and it will not be introduced overnight.  However, there is one major shortcoming which the Minister has failed to address and a selective approach has been adopted as to what measure should be taken. There is a perception abroad that the chief of staff is the overall commanding officer of the Defence Forces, but it will come as a surprise to most people to discover this is not true.  Military command of the Defence Forces under the direction of the President is exercisable by the Government through and by the Minister for Defence.  Military command is delegated by the Minister to the general officers commanding the four territorial commands, the eastern, southern, western and the Curragh, the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service.  These personnel are responsible to the Minister for the exercise of command.</P>
    <P>An article published in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> dealing with this legislation states that the legislation intends to make the chief of staff of the Defence Forces solely responsible for military affairs, but this is not correct.  There is no overall commanding officer of the Defence Forces other than the Minister.  This will still be the case if and when this Bill is passed.  Section 4(2) does not address this problem.  The Price Waterhouse report states this could be addressed in two ways by making the chief of staff the overall commander of the Defence Forces reporting to the Minister or by continuing to have three principal military officers, albeit with different titles and functions, reporting to the Minister.  This Bill does not do either.  The report also states, and I agree with its recommendation, that the optimum route, having regard to sound management practice, would be to have the chief of staff as the overall commander of the Defence Forces.  Such a model would provide a single focus for the restructuring of the organisation, provide a more rational management hierarchy and enable authority, responsibility and accountability for the performance of delegated functions to be clearly specified.</P>
    <P>I hope this issue will be considered in the promised White Paper.  While there are sound reasons for creating the organisational structures we have today, as mentioned in the Minister's speech, the time has come to consider radical change.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the Bill addresses certain matters.  Section 3 deals with the abolition of the appointments of adjutant general and quarter master general.  The new roles for deputy chiefs of staff operations and support should make the organisation more efficient.  Our present system of the three military officers with the chief of staff as the first among equals is to the best of my knowledge unique to this country.  The section also deals with the method of appointment and the Minister is seeking to change this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Price Waterhouse report, Mr. <Col N="551" /> Kelly, in a covering letter to the chairman of the EAG group, when referring to the changes, stated that during the implementation it will be vital to retain the confidence and co-operation of the military authorities in making a radical overhaul of the Defence Forces.  I do not believe there is any necessity to make changes as proposed in section 3 paragraphs (c) and (b).  Why is the Minister considering this route?</P>
    <P>The symbolic nature of the present method of appointment is important.  At a time when the Defence Forces feel under threat from all sections of society, I ask the Minister to table an amendment as his present proposal can only be seen as downgrading the new appointments and an effort to bring them into a political arena of sorts.  If the Minister follows this route, it will have a devastating effect on morale which will quickly filter down to the end of the line.  There is no requirement for such a measure.  It can only be harmful and the Minister should not let anybody tell him otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will abolish the present CS4 and enable the military to commence the reorganisation of the various units, the Minister referred to this at length.  There is much uncertainty in many areas about how this will impact and I hope there will be an early release of information to those sectors which are concerned about it.  It is an enabling section and it is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 6 passes the responsibility of dealing with a redress of wrongs from the Adjutant-General to the Chief of Staff.  This procedure has been a protective safeguard to the rights of the individual and I am sure it will remain so.</P>
    <P>With respect to section 9, will the new Deputy Chiefs of Staff be members of the Council of Defence &mdash; my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald has already referred to this?  If so, has the Minister any plans for the council to meet to discuss other reforms?</P>
    <P>There is a general lack of knowledge in all sections of society with respect to the structures and workings of the Defence Forces.  This is not helped by the fact that the printing and notice of publication of the Defence Forces Regulations was dispensed with by direction of the Attorney General under the provisions of sections 2(3) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could take up this point with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Chief of Staff will be the head of the Defence Forces headquarters. However, he will not be the overall commander of the Defence Forces.  He states he will have responsibility for the overall management of the Defence Forces.  What exactly does that mean? The Minister mentioned that the previous Government had looked at the position of the Chief of Staff and that it wished him to be empowered to act as chief executive.  The present role of the Chief of Staff is not one of chief executive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> The Minister stated that the changes proposed in this Bill follow from the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces in 1994.  Certainly, that report refers to many of them, but it is amazing the different conclusions one can draw from a report.  I disagree with the Minister on several of its more important aspects.</P>
    <P>This Bill only tinkers with the system without introducing any real, substantial reform.  It is premature and inappropriate in advance of the promised publication of a White Paper on Defence.  A full debate is required on all aspects of Defence which addresses comprehensively all the issues.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the launch of the two medals yesterday at the opening of the peace-keeping exhibition in the former Collins Barracks. He mentioned during his fine speech that we are proud of Ireland's overseas record.  He went on to mention the contribution Ireland makes to the humanitarian aspect of such missions in orphanages, schools, etc.  Bearing that in mind, I want the Minister to increase the funding which is given to the battalions overseas for local welfare matters.  I am sure he will address that in a positive manner.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcomes in principle the publication of this Bill.  It is relatively straightforward legislative reform which is designed to update the Defence Act, 1954, and put in place a more rational management structure at the top level of the Defence Forces.  In this respect the Bill is welcome.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill is being introduced at one of the most critical times in the history of the Defence Forces.  The public concern over the Army deafness compensation claims and the effect the whole saga has had on Army morale is the most critical challenge facing the Defence Forces and the Minister.  The scale of this controversy is such that I believe there is an obligation on Members, particularly those who have responsibility for the Defence portfolio, to raise it with the Minister at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Bill, the Minister's intentions regarding Army deafness are relevant.  Any organisational reform of the Army must be designed to improve both morale and performance of the Defence Forces.  However, as long as the Army deafness saga casts a shadow over Army morale, the institutional and organisational reform introduced in this Bill will not achieve the benefits it is intended to bring.  I will return to this matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the thinking behind the new headquarters structure and the creation of new Deputy Chief of Staff posts.  These developments are welcome and will provide the Defence Forces with more rational administrative and operational structures.  It has often been stated by commentators that the structure of the Defence Forces headquarters is related to the establishment of the State and the legitimate fears at that time of a possible <i>coup d'état.</i>  The <Col N="553" /> experience of the Curragh mutiny of 1924 clearly influenced thinking on this matter.  The division of powers between the Chief of Staff, the Quartermaster General and the Adjutant-General is directly related to this experience and it is right and proper that we should now amend the legislation to fashion a new structure for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The genesis of this Bill is the report of the Efficiency Audit Group, which the previous Government accepted in July 1995.  An implementation group to consider the costs of restructuring and other related matters was established and this process has now been brought to a conclusion by the Minister with the introduction of the Bill.  However, a number of questions arise regarding this Bill which I hope the Minister will be in a position to clarify when he replies.  The Bill does not refer to the structures governing the Air Corps or the Naval Service.  However, from newspaper reports in recent days, it is clear that the Price Waterhouse review suggests greater independence for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  This Bill makes no reference to these recommendations although the matter is due to be discussed at Cabinet.  Is this Bill an interim measure and does the Minister intend to introduce a more substantial Bill which will radically reform the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>Perhaps, in replying, the Minister will give us some insight into his thoughts on the contents of the Price Waterhouse review.  Does he agree with the recommendations regarding increased independence for the Air Corps and the Naval Service? Does he accept the re-equipment plan proposed in that review and is the Government prepared to put the recommended investment in place?  Will he implement the decentralisation of both the Naval Service and the Air Corps that the review suggested?  I would appreciate answers on these points.</P>
    <P>While I know that some of the Minister's colleagues would be inclined to delay an announcement on the relocation of the Naval Service to Haulbowline until a certain electoral contest in Cork is under way, I hope the Minister will not allow his decisions regarding the structure of the Defence Forces to be influenced in this way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the interests of the Naval Service for the message to go out that reform of that institution is reliant on the vagaries of electoral politics.  Such a move would do a disservice to the Naval Service and the Minister, who is committed to rational reform of the Defence Forces. I hope his party colleagues take notice of this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an issue affecting the Air Corps which I wish to raise with the Minister.  Perhaps <Col N="554" /> the Minister might confirm whether it is true that the State is currently employing voluntary military personnel, such as ex-RAF and US Air Force members, to fly the Gulf Stream jet.  Is it true that despite the fact that there are currently 12 NCOs trained to fly the jet, they are prohibited from doing so because they are not commissioned officers?  If this is the case, it strikes me as bizarre and wasteful.  Not only is it incurring unnecessary expense on the Air Corps budget, it is also frustrating the career development of Air Corps pilots. Time and again in this House the Minister has outlined his difficulties regarding the retention of trained pilots in the Air Corps and the fact that he is unable to compete with offers made by the civil aviation sector.  However, if it is true that the career development of Air Corps pilots is restricted, as I have outlined above, is it any wonder that pilots get frustrated at their role in the Air Corps?  I want the Minister to respond to this point and indicate the urgent steps he will take to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>I also want the Minister to outline the status of the Council of Defence.  As I understand it, this body has not met officially for a number of years. I am surprised that a Bill such as this does not seriously look at the relevance of such a body and propose reform for it as it is clear it has little relevance to the operation and organisation of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address courts martial procedures. This is a serious omission.  The United Kingdom procedures have been challenged in the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds of impartiality and the role of the Judge Advocate. The British Government has promised to introduce new legislation to make the process more independent.  Have these judgments been examined in relation to the Defence Act, 1954, and is further amending legislation required to address the matter?</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to address the commitment given in the White Paper on Foreign Affairs published in 1997 to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of UN Personnel Overseas which penalises actions taken against UN servicemen and women.  RACO and PDFORRA have called on the Government to ratify the convention but it has taken no action on this front.  In that respect this legislation represents a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>While the Bill deals with the reorganisation of top level management structures in the Defence Forces, it is appropriate to dwell on other ranks. The new management structure proposed must have a tangible effect on the operation of the Defence Forces at all levels.  The Minister will be aware of my ongoing concern regarding the Army apprenticeship school at Devoy Barracks in Naas. Many members of the Defence Forces are concerned about its future.  I appreciate the close co-operation between the school and Kildare VEC and the valuable training provided.  I am, however, seriously concerned about its decline.  It would be a great loss to the Defence Forces and the community at large.  The time has come for <Col N="555" /> the Minister to look radically at the operation of the school in a broader context.</P>
    <P>In the past State companies were the driving force behind the apprenticeship system.  That is no longer the case and the number of apprentices in semi-State companies such as CIE, the ESB and Bord na Móna has dropped considerably. Across the State sector there is much duplication and little co-ordination in the training of apprentices. The time has come for the Minister, in association with his Cabinet colleagues, to look seriously at this situation.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for streamlining the apprenticeship system and establishing a national scheme based at Devoy Barracks.  There are a wide variety of skills that are common to many trades.  These skills, for a large number of apprentices, could be taught at Devoy Barracks, avoiding costly duplication throughout the system. Apprentices could return at the end of the second year to their sponsoring company to fine tune their skills to meet the specific requirements of their profession.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give consideration to a proposal along these lines.  We need imaginative solutions to the problems facing the Defence Forces. We should move beyond the limits we have imposed on co-operation between the Defence Forces and other elements of the State sector.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to reorganise top level management structures of the Defence Forces leading to a more coherent and effective performance. There are genuine doubts, however, about the effect of such reform while the shadow of deafness claims hangs over the Army.  The Minister has taken a number of steps to resolve this complex problem.  The Opposition has closely scrutinised his proposals every step of the way. This is right and proper.  I hope he will agree the Opposition has not attempted to turn this serious problem into a political football or vainly tried to score cheap political points.</P>
    <P>There have been significant developments in recent weeks which have not been discussed in the House other than in an Adjournment debate sought by Deputy Fitzgerald and me on 18 June. The Minister's strategy has unravelled.  Following the judgment in the first case to be heard following the enactment of the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Bill he claimed that a compensation standard of £1,500 per 1 per cent hearing loss had been established by the court.  He took steps to establish a compensation tribunal on this basis.  It is clear that this was extremely premature and that not all the relevant facts were addressed in that judgment, particularly in relation to the age of a claimant as demonstrated in subsequent cases.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the Adjournment debate on 18 June the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on behalf of the Minister, said that a further major test case would be prepared in the near future to address the issues that had arisen.  What progress has been made since then?  Does the Minister <Col N="556" /> believe the establishment of a tribunal based on the figure of £1,500 per 1 per cent hearing loss is still tenable or has he reviewed his stance on this matter?</P>
    <P>This legislation institutes welcome, if modest, reform of the Defence Forces.  The Minister, however, has been overly conservative and has missed an excellent opportunity to address a number of key organisational issues that will have to be dealt with.  As such, the Bill, while welcome in principle, fails to impress or inspire confidence. Its impact on the Defence Forces will be determined greatly by developments in the Army deafness claims saga.  I urge the Minister to fashion a comprehensive solution to achieve three basic aims &mdash; to protect the taxpayer and the Defence Forces' budget from bogus claims; to ensure those genuinely suffering from a disability as a result of negligence are adequately compensated; and, most important, to restore morale and bring to an end the near constant barrage of abuse and humiliation that has been unjustly hurled at Defence Forces' members.</P>

      <P>The aims of the Bill are straightforward, they are, to reorganise top level management structures in the Defence Forces; to streamline the chain of command; and to abolish two military branches.  Under section 4 there will be only one military element presided over by the Chief of Staff to be known as Defence Forces headquarters.  This is in line with the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group which were approved by Government and whose findings were referred to an implementation group to be costed.  As a result of this exercise it is necessary to amend the Defence Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>Section 5 amends the regulations to prescribe the overall strength of the Defence Forces and the number of personnel in each rank.  This is a matter on which I am anxious to seek clarification. It has connotations of barracks closures. Does the reduction of the Defence Forces command structure to a single unit mean there will be a corresponding reduction in the overall number of barracks?  This is a sensitive issue in County Cork.  Many officers and privates are deeply concerned at the rumours circulating in the three barracks located there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Collins Barracks in Cork city which is situated on 52 acres of land has a total strength of nearly 900.  Ballincollig Barracks is situated on 150 acres while Fermoy Barracks is situated on 12 acres. All three are in poor structural condition.  There has been minimal investment over the past 30 years.  Major investment is required to raise standards to those obtaining in Dublin and along the Border with which they compare unfavourably. The working and accommodation areas leave <Col N="557" /> much to be desired.  The living areas at Collins Barracks may have been up to standard at the time of Queen Victoria while some of the working areas would be condemned under the Factories Act if it applied.</P>
    <P>The 1996 restructuring plan for the Defence Forces contained a commitment to review barracks as part of the rationalisation plan.  This is to take place during the period July to September 1998.  I am advised that two barracks in the Cork area were identified as likely candidates for possible closure.  I continue to believe this to be true despite the strong condemnation, by the Army and a Member of this House, of my public statement to that effect late last year.  The two barracks to which I refer are located at Fermoy and Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>Ballincollig Barracks, which has a staff of approximately 160 personnel, is situated on 150 acres of prime commercial land astride the town's business thoroughfare.  I am led to believe the Army intends to close the barracks.  Will the Chief of Staff, the Minister or the Government have the final say in this matter?  I am informed that the Department's view is that the barracks because of its prime location is a valuable commercial property which greatly inhibits further and much needed commercial and amenity development in the town.  The Department also believes that many of the personnel serving in Ballincollig, who live in the area between that town and Cork, would not be averse to serving in Collins Barracks.  This would facilitate a relocation of the artillery unit in Ballincollig to Collins Barracks in Cork where there is room to provide the necessary additional facilities required.  Such a relocation could be funded by the commercial use of the 150 acres on which the barracks is situated.  I cannot say that I share the Department's view.</P>
    <P>Fermoy Barracks, which houses a garrison of over 100, straddles the main road at the north end of Fermoy town.  It is situated on 12 acres, with a large frontage on to the main road.  Such is the poor state of the barracks' structure that it would be cheaper to build a new barracks.  I am informed the timber buildings in the barracks are rotten and they were condemned almost 30 years ago.  It is deplorable that soldiers are obliged to live in such poor conditions.  The sale of the 12 acres in Fermoy would provide funding, in whole or in part, for the required building of a new infrastructure in the Kilworth Camp to accommodate personnel from Fermoy Barracks.  For the information of Members, Kilworth Camp is located approximately four miles north of Fermoy which would mean that a relocation would cause minimum disruption to the members of the Defence Forces stationed in that town.</P>
    <P>A substantial investment will be required to bring either Fermoy Barracks or Kilworth Camp up to acceptable modern standards.  Indeed, a substantial investment is also required at Collins Barracks.  In view of the restructuring of the top positions in the Army, is the Minister in a position <Col N="558" /> to indicate the amount of capital funding which will be made available to the Chief of Staff to modernise Army barracks in the Cork area?</P>
    <P>I have asked these questions, which are legitimate, because I must provide answers to my constituents and I am sure the Minister will be glad to reply to them.  In the event that he is concerned, I assure the Minister that I intend to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is great to see such interest in defence matters, given that an important football match is being played this evening.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill because the House does not often discuss defence matters.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers welcomed the Bill, partly because most parties were in Government in recent years and the legislation was not dreamt up in recent weeks.  The reorganisation of the Defence Forces was discussed on a number of occasions in recent years and everyone recognises that they require a major overhaul.  The Bill sets out to bring about a modern management structure, which is badly needed, and promotes a fresh approach to regulating the military organisation, which is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>With regard to hearing impairment claims, an issue which has received a great deal of media attention in recent months, I pay tribute to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, who is the first holder of that office to tackle this problem in a serious fashion.  A number of his predecessors saw hearing impairment claims as a difficult issue with which to deal and one to which there was no simple solution.  It is a difficult problem and I acknowledge the Minister's tremendous efforts in attempting to resolve it.  At the same time, however, we are not out of the woods yet. I would like to believe the problem is now manageable but that remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>I found the media's interest in this issue somewhat strange.  As a previous speaker stated, some unfortunate people who suffered hearing damage and who were entitled to take their cases to court were ridiculed in the media.  I accept that a number of false claims were submitted and to a large extent those responsible must accept the blame for what happened.  However, many decent members of the Army submitted claims and had every good reason to do so.  From the outset I believed we should have devised a system where it would not be as expensive for soldiers or the Government to become involved in negotiating claims.  That is what the Minister has tried to do and I hope he is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be foolish if we did not recognise the damage this episode has done to the Army and the effect it has had on morale.  From here on we must concentrate our efforts on trying to restore that morale.  Each year the House has the opportunity to review the performance of the Defence Forces when the Minister reports on <Col N="559" /> their overseas duties during the previous 12 months.  It is only when a tragedy occurs that we realise the danger and difficulties encountered by members of the Defence Forces during their service overseas.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy at the way soldiers and their families have been described in the media.  A large number of Defence Forces personnel live and work in County Kildare and apart from their normal duties they play a tremendous role in terms of community and voluntary work in the county, which is much appreciated.  Under the implementation plan, it was agreed that the Curragh would become the training ground for the Defence Forces. Unfortunately, I have not witnessed the construction of new structures or buildings or the arrival of new equipment.  I am aware the implementation plan covers a ten year period and involves a process of ongoing reform.  Soldiers recognise that it will not be easy and that they will be obliged to make sacrifices during that period. We must ensure they are not kept in the dark.  It is important that PDFORRA and RACO be consulted in a meaningful way and informed about the action we intend to take.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn is anxious to ensure the various barracks in County Cork to which he referred remain open.  People can be parochial about this issue.  However, if they consider it in a sensible fashion they will realise that details of a third voluntary retirement scheme were announced recently which will reduce the number of serving members in the Defence Forces and the layers of unnecessary administration and ensure that more troops become available for operational duties.  That is a welcome development because we are trying to create a more efficient Defence Force.  If we are going to do so, it will not be possible to retain a number of existing barracks.  We are only kidding ourselves if we think that is possible.  In the past Ministers have been reluctant to make their views known on the matter.  However, people realise that some barracks will have to be closed.  It is a sensitive issue because in many areas barracks provide employment and business, but the Minister should deal with it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In many cases the barracks are on valuable sites.  The disruption caused by the closure of some barracks would not be great.  However, whatever barracks are closed and sold we must ensure the proceeds of the sales are reinvested in the Army which suffers badly from a lack of new equipment and facilities.  Deputy O'Flynn pointed out that some of the accommodation in which Army families live is deplorable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall and others have made approaches to successive Ministers for Defence with regard to the sale of Army houses in the Curragh.  I welcome the Minister's recent decision to sell the Orchard Park houses and give those living there an opportunity to own their homes.  The Minister's approach is at once humanitarian and <Col N="560" /> realistic and the families involved are appreciative of the opportunity they will have.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty with regard to the swimming pool in the Curragh.  I understand it is planned to close it tomorrow because it cannot remain open for health and safety reasons.  I ask the Minister to treat this matter as a priority. Apart from the Defence Force members and their families, many neighbouring schools use the pool.  It is one of the few amenities in the area and it is used by hundreds of young people. Deputy Wall and I have been inundated with questions from constituents about its closure.  A few years ago it closed for a period and we want to ensure that does not happen again.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the work necessary to restore the pool to the required standard is undertaken so that it may reopen quickly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has not had an easy time during his period in office but he has taken his job seriously.  I appeal to him to deal with the matters raised.  The restructuring of the Defence Forces will bring benefits and will create problems.  It is important that all members of the Defence Forces take ownership of the plan if it is to be a success and they should not be kept in the dark.  As soon as decisions are made about their future the decisions should be communicated to them.  That is the least they deserve.</P>

      <P>No, Dublin North-West. Nonetheless, a considerable number of Army personnel live in the constituency because there are military installations close by.  There is a reasonable amount of interest in matters related to the Department of Defence among my constituents. I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for the briefing given to us.  It was helpful in understanding the complex way in which the Bill had to be presented.</P>
      <P>It came as a surprise to me that the Quartermaster General and the Adjutant General are not answerable directly to the Chief of Staff but to the Minister.  I was also surprised by Deputy Timmins's suggestion that those in charge of the regional areas are also answerable directly to the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister might explain the procedures involved.  Not many people are <i>au fait</i> with the command structure of the Army.  People are generally happy to know that the Army is a well organised, credible force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent controversy about the deafness issue has dented the Army's credibility.  It has dented its morale and the vast majority of Defence Force members are appalled at what has happened in that regard.  I do not criticise the way the Minister handled the issue.  It is an issue on which, no matter what one does, one's actions are <Col N="561" /> open to criticism.  I do not say that the way in which it has been dealt with has been perfect but there is not a perfect way to deal with it.  I hope a speedy resolution can be found and a nonjudicial or court-based process to deal with cases can be arrived at.  We must protect those who have genuine claims and ensure they are compensated fairly when the claims are established.  We must rule out those claims which are not valid.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Army had drawn great credit on itself.  It seemed to have developed a lot more respect than it had when I was growing up. It was my view that there was not much respect for the Army at that time.  The role of the Defence Forces in peace-keeping in particular, the role of the Navy in fisheries protection and the role of the Air Corps in rescue work have added to the credibility and good standing of the Defence Forces.  The deafness controversy has done serious damage to that good standing and it may be some time before that can be recovered.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the non-publication of the Price Waterhouse review of the Defence Forces. It is a pity the report came to public attention and to the attention of the Defence Forces by way of leaks.  It is not the first time that such leaks have occurred.  It would make for a far better and more mature debate if these reports were made available as soon as they become available to the Department, following their due consideration by the Minister.  There should be no further delay in the publication of that report.</P>
    <P>Leaks of this kind are often selective.  We are not sure whether the full recommendations have been leaked.  In so far as they have, I would be particularly worried about any move towards the privatising of aspects of the Naval Service or indeed the Air Corps.  I say that not for any ideological approach to private ownership or private services, but I feel very strongly that the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be accountable, through the Minister, to this House and they cannot be if services of this kind are hived off and privatised in any way.  The figure which has been published &mdash; perhaps the Minister could confirm its accuracy &mdash; of a requirement of £235 million over ten years seems not an unduly burdensome investment in essential services.  I hope, given the buoyancy within our taxation and in the revenue of the State, that investment will be made.</P>
    <P>I was very much struck by an article by Lorna Siggins in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 June 1998.  I am sure the Minister has had it brought to his attention, not least because there are some words of praise for the Minister in it when she refers to his strength in dealing with difficult issues.  She quotes a number of ratios for our Naval Service compared to other European countries.  I was quite shocked by a sum she did in relation to the coverage of our territorial seas which showed that we have the equivalent of two Garda squad cars for the whole State covering our territorial seas. That is grossly inadequate.  She points out that drug runners find it 20 times easier to access European waters through the Irish maritime corridor <Col N="562" /> than through any other corridor through which they might seek access.  Obviously such statistics strengthen the Minister's arguments at European level in seeking assistance for protecting our waters.  Apart from that aspect, we have an enormously rich resource in the seas around our island and they are not being adequately developed.  I do not know the fishery statistics but I am quite certain that significantly more fish is taken from the waters over which we have control by ships and boats from other countries than are taken out of it by Irish boats.  We need to do two things &mdash; first, to protect those waters adequately, and second to adequately develop our fishery fleet to make sure that we are properly developing that resource.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with some speakers who argue that this Bill should not have been brought forward or suggested that it might not have been brought forward until we had a White Paper.  I appreciate that it would be far neater and better if we had a White Paper on which to base legislation of this kind so that there would be a logical sequence to the changes.  I know, however, that it is quite a major task to produce a White Paper on any aspect of Government work and it would be a pity to delay obvious reforms such as this one pending a more general policy paper.  That is not to say that we do not need a White Paper on the Defence Forces.  It would be useful if the Minister indicated when we can expect the promised White Paper.</P>
    <P>I agree too with section 5 which makes it possible for the Minister to dispense with the necessity to nominate or to make various appointments and regulations with regard to size of units and so on.  I imagine that kind of over regulation and minute overseeing by the Minister of the day probably derived from the early days of the State &mdash; the mutiny in the Curragh in l924 was mentioned. I am sure that is what gave rise to the carryover.  It would be interesting to know why the Government of the day, as late as l954, felt that it was necessary to have that kind of extraordinarily detailed control over appointments at very low levels.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to a report that the Defence Forces may need to detail or order technical staff to take up positions in the Lebanon and elsewhere.  There was a report that there was difficulty in getting sufficient medical orderlies, truck drivers and cooks and it was suggested that the reserve forces might be used or, alternatively, that people might be contracted from the private sector to do this type of work much as private doctors are contracted on yearly contracts where there is an inadequate supply.  Some representatives in the Defence Forces raised objections to the idea of the reserve Defence Forces being used in this way because they feared what they referred to as &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; abuse of those positions. I would much rather see the reserve Defence Forces used in this way.  It seems rather demeaning to our reserve force to say that they are not fit for or capable of doing this work or <Col N="563" /> that their training could not be upgraded to do that work.  In consultation with the representative bodies of the Defence Forces it should be possible to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment are no less satisfactory than those for the Defence Forces.  The objections of the regular Defence Forces, if I might refer to them as such, may be self-serving there.  If I were a member of the Defence Forces in the Lebanon, I would be much happier to have a member of the FCA drive me than a private civilian driver, because I would know that person would have at least a minimum training in Army matters. It would give a boost to our reserve forces to be involved in this way.  Obviously any move in that direction would require consultation and agreement with the Defence Forces representative bodies.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to make those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all of my colleagues for what was a very positive debate.  There was warm praise for the Defence Forces, the Navy and the Air Corps, which I greatly appreciate.  I acknowledge the concerns expressed about the effect of the whole deafness saga, either on credibility or morale, as far as the Defence Forces are concerned.  I am conscious of the need to resolve this matter quickly and fairly and to move it away from the glare of publicity.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time Deputy Fitzgerald has inferred a spin on these stories.  I reject that, if it has any implication for either myself or the Department because it is something that is being put about by some of the representative organisations.</P>
      <P>In fairness, if 12,000 claimants come forward over a very short period, and if the court awards are different from those anywhere else in the world, and if a huge percentage have, by any criterion, minor disabilities, it is a matter of public interest and one to which the public will attach importance.  If court hearings are taking place every day in this city, Cork and Limerick, it is impossible to have an ongoing debate without concentrating on something like that.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I am conscious of the need to bring this matter to a head.  I would like to be in a position to put in place an army compensation board by the autumn where we would have an affordable quantum that is fair to the taxpayer and fair to those who have been injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, it is a pity this problem has coincided with a tremendous chapter in the history of the Defence Forces, the Navy and the Air Corps, particularly in terms of peace-keeping, humanitarian tasks and rescue operations in various parts of the world.  I thank Deputy Timmins for his comments about yesterday's ceremony.  It was very nice to meet some of the people who served in the Congo and hear them say they are happy this has happened for their colleagues.  That history is tremendous for a <Col N="564" /> small country like ours in our relationship with other countries, the experience gained by the military personnel, the team work that is involved and in finding out one's strengths and weaknesses.</P>
    <P>I want to put matters into this context.  The vast majority of serving and retired soldiers have not made any claim.  My job is to ensure that everybody who has worn the uniform with distinction does not get hurt.  The best way to do that is to put in place an affordable and fair system which deals with people genuinely injured but does not pay out huge sums to those who have minor disabilities.</P>
    <P>As far as the Price Waterhouse report on the Navy and Air Corps is concerned, I expect it to come before the Government on 8 July.  It will be published before the end of July and I will ensure there is a good public debate on it.  We will then proceed to have an implementation plan and seek to put that plan in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to an article by Lorna Siggins.  In the early part of that article she referred to my record in the Department of the Environment which I was happy to consign to history. In the marginal constituency I represent I am not anxious to see it paraded in front of me every time I try to do something.  There has been an unnecessary delay.  The previous Government felt the first Price Waterhouse report was not comprehensive enough and it asked the company to carry out a more detailed analysis of the problems and come forward with the final report.  It carries out its own research and it comes to the Government through the Taoiseach's office.  The memorandum has been prepared and circulated and the report is expected to come before us on 8 July.</P>
    <P>It is important to record that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  There are permanent positions.  Many engineering, infrastructural and other investments are being made in Baldonnel. We had the opportunity to see Ms Brogan get her wings and I send warmest congratulations to her on being the first woman to achieve that.  We will seriously examine how we can continue that development.  We are in the process of purchasing a new fishery protection vessel.  It is currently being built and will be commissioned in August 1999.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a vast expanse of water to be patrolled and that we will not solve all the problems overnight but we must look to a systematic way of addressing fishery surveillance and also drug interdiction in the context of international crime.  We may not be in a position to do everything but with the resources we have there have been some spectacular successes involving links with Garda activities and the drug squad as well as the support we give to Garda surveillance which the Deputy will be familiar with in respect of at least one part of his constituency.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Timmins use the expression &ldquo;a cultural change&rdquo;.  We are dealing with many outmoded and outdated rules and <Col N="565" /> the essence of this Bill is to loosen up those rules. As far as manpower management is concerned, there will not be any inflexibility.  The intention is to give more to Army management.  This year, up to £60 million will be given to various areas to allow them purchase, delegate or do the work themselves.  There has been change in the catering, rationing and other areas.  I want to see greater autonomy throughout the system but the Price Waterhouse report will refer to efficiencies corresponding with that.  It is not good enough to demand the power to do everything.  We have to ensure that there is efficiency and that we are modernised on every front.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa thought there might be a political aspect to the change that is proposed in terms of appointments by the Government. Deputy De Rossa has been a member of Government and he will be aware that when people are being appointed to responsible posts like that, nominations are brought forward by successive Governments on the basis that they are the best people for the job.  That is all I would have in mind and I certainly would not accuse any of my predecessors in that regard.  If there is a serious task to be undertaken, the last thing anyone thinks about is the political aspect.  I give every possible assurance on that matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greater autonomy with responsibility.  I shudder sometimes at the amount of regulation that exists, the cumbersome and burdensome systems we have imposed on ourselves. We need to consider those in the context of the White Paper.  This is a short Bill dealing with headquarters, streamlining the system and making way for the three brigade systems to be put in place.  I accept the point made by Deputy De Rossa that it will not be possible to wait for the White Paper.  I gave a commitment on coming to office that a White Paper would be published within one year, but that has not proved possible.</P>
    <P>A good deal of preliminary work has been done.  An expert in my Department has been delegated to working on this matter full time.  We will invite submissions very soon by public advertisement from the representative associations and others.  We will have discussions with the representative associations on how we can help them address the key issues.  A White Paper will deal with the longer term platform for development and it will equally deal with the mid-term review of the present position.</P>
    <P>Consultations must take place with the Department of Foreign Affairs in terms of our peace-keeping requirements.  We have upgraded the equipment in this area.  We will get our first tranche of armoured personnel carriers next year which will provide greater flexibility to take on tasks that were not possible previously and ensure the safety of troops, which is uppermost in our mind.  Discussions must also take place with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on national security issues, the peace process and how it will affect the work of the <Col N="566" /> Defence Forces, the locations involved and what the personnel who are no longer required will do. All those issues will emerge over time.  Deputy De Rossa believes it will take time to finalise those matters, and that probably will be the case. I do not like to put a timeframe on it, but I would not like it to be more than two years from the time we came to office.  At the same time I would like the job to be done well, with the best possible consultation.</P>
    <P>On the command structure, in practice in the four commands the brigadier general reports to the Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General and Quartermaster General, and they in turn report to me. I do not have direct day to day contact with those people, but I have always been the kind of Minister who breaks the rules in terms of making contact directly with people in the regions.  I like to have a direct personal relationship with as many people as possible, and that applies from the ground up, but there are limitations to what can be done.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy De Rossa's comments on the Reserve Defence Force.  I come from a background which has provided me with a great sense of understanding and support for all voluntary organisations, particularly the Reserve Defence Force.  I was unhappy about the publicity surrounding what was a building brick in an edifice, and it will take some time to resolve that matter.</P>
    <P>We live in a society where there is much interdependency. There is expertise available, which is necessary.  We have had difficulty in fulfilling our UN requirements in some specialist areas. We looked at the position in other countries that experience difficulties in meeting their commitments. We would like to honour fully our commitments. Preliminary discussions are taking place on what to do in circumstances where there are shortages.  A full complement of the various ranges of expertise is needed to fulfil the mandate and ensure the job is done.  Those discussions will be ongoing.  I encourage people to be open-minded and not make predictions about what is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn is concerned about barracks closures.  This matter has been the subject of much debate over the years.  This Bill is not the appropriate legislation in which to go into detail on the issue, except to say that I am ashamed of some of the facilities in various parts of the country. Given the competing considerations in the Defence Force, there is no possibility in present financial circumstances of this or any future Government spending the money necessary to upgrade all the facilities.  It is essential that significant funds are spent on refurbishment and the provision of good facilities.  The environment in which people are expected to work and where they are trained, the services available and morale, are important aspects to be considered.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to develop and refurbish all our barracks.  I have to look at the present property portfolio and see how funds can be raised to upgrade equipment and facilities.  Deep consideration <Col N="567" /> will have to be given to all these matters.  I will not guarantee that all barracks, some of which were established decades ago and are now falling down, will be retained.  In some cases those buildings are situated on valuable property which may be considered for alternative purposes such as community, commercial and housing development. I will, however, fight for the resources for re-equipment and redevelopment.  If people elected to this House believe that, regardless of the circumstances, all barracks must be retained, they should not be in politics.  Sometimes difficult decisions must be made which ultimately are better for the community and the people.</P>
    <P>I wish to give a commitment in regard to the Curragh.  I am disappointed with the facility there.  It is a lovely building on a terrific tract of land with easy access and much potential, but it is in great need of a facelift.  A master plan is needed for its future.  I will ensure the swimming pool is put back into operation quickly.  I said earlier I would dedicate the resources from the sale of Orchard Park houses to that development. When the engineer's report is available the funds will be provided.  I am sorry the swimming pool had to be closed, but when there is a risk to people's lives, facilities must be closed.  I give a commitment to find the resources to ensure, when the report on its refurbishment is prepared, that the work will be carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald expressed reservations about the effect of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.  She is correct and the military authorities also had concerns about this. However, the position of the Chief of Staff relative to the Minister is completely unaffected by the Act and it seems this fear centres on the fact that reference to outputs in the Act will in some way undermine military management.  We have taken legal advice to ensure this is not the case. On the contrary, this Bill is in harmony with other public service legislation.  The Deputy Chiefs of Staff will sit on the Council of Defence and, more importantly, they will be on the strategic management committee.  In one sense a management structure is created which is on a par with most organisations.  An individual is fully in charge and he or she is answerable.  At the same time teamwork, strategic management and all the resources we have will be dedicated to the best possible management systems to bring the best out of personnel in all ranks.  The ranks decide who and what one is.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to go into detail on the amendments which have been tabled.  I hope I tried to deal openly with all the major questions raised.  I am very conscious that we strayed over many areas not covered in the Bill. This is not a criticism, but an indication on the one hand of peoples' interest in it, and, on the other, of the need to introduce comprehensive legislation which will deal with the entire ambit of what is involved.  However, I am grateful to Deputies for working late with me this evening <Col N="568" /> and I understand they must work late also tomorrow. I look forward to their continued support and interest in the development of the Defence Forces at this crucial time as we approach the end of the millennium.</P>
    <P>We have enjoyed a great deal of good publicity in spite of everything else that has happened.  Pat Kenny and Gerry Ryan visited the Lebanon and we have received good media reports, some of which were referred to earlier.  We want to concentrate on these positives.  If I did not have a great belief in what I am doing and in the people who serve in the Defence Forces, I would not have these concerns, but I am only expressing what the majority of people in this House feel about the work they do.  That some issues have gone wrong should not deter us from sticking to the positive, developmental and core matters. This is a piece of the anatomy which keeps the entire body together in terms of manpower, management and, I hope by the end of the week, this legislation will be presented to the President, Mrs. McAleese, so that there will be no further delay in putting the structure of headquarters in place and the downstream effect with the establishment of the three brigades can follow immediately afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the dire state of much of the accommodation and facilities that the Defence Forces have and the enormous cost to the State of refurbishing or replacing them.  Has he considered using the device introduced in the Finance Act, 1998, for the provision of educational facilities in DCU where a tax concession is offered to an investor who is prepared to provide the facility on a lease back basis, which is at virtually no cost to the State, but remains in the ownership of the State ultimately?  It seems to be a device which would prevent an explosion in public expenditure and would encourage people who have a great deal of money and are perhaps salting it away in offshore accounts to invest it here in infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, but as the Deputy is aware, the Government has been giving consideration for some time to a public-private investment system.  I recall giving consideration to this matter when I was Minister for the Environment. It involved an interesting proposal from an American consortium.  One of the discoveries I made, which did not help at the time, was that the National Treasury Management Agency was able to borrow the money at a more competitive rate than it might pay back to this group.  It was a technical option outside borrowing, but it only manicured the books.  I was more interested in trying to see if I had surplus property which was valuable and could be immediately converted and would have multiple uses through the services in it for a town or community.  The disposal and sale of such property on a commercial basis gave me the freedom to transfer these resources to the refurbishment, re-equipment and redevelopment. <Col N="569" /> I did not envisage that it would be necessary or desirable to think in terms of total refurbishment. However, there may be opportunities that I could look at in that context in special circumstances.  I will examine whether I can make progress on it and I will answer the Deputy in another way when I have time to consider it.</P>

      <P>The matters raised by Deputies Broughan and Hayes will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this vital issue.  A profound crisis is facing us as a nation in terms of the provision of housing, particularly for people on lower incomes.  It is particularly acute in Dublin city where a number of years ago when my party was in Government the waiting list reduced to under 4,000 families, but has now shot up to 6,000 and many others face eviction from private rented accommodation.  It is growing daily and the Government has not shown any sense of urgency in coming forward to respond to this problem.  We know the causes following the Bacon report which include changing demographics with the return of emigrants and their families, problems associated with young homeless people, separations, divorces and all the difficulties in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>These problems are exacerbated in Dublin city and Fingal by other special qualities.  We made a decision to refurbish and rebuild many areas in the city and in my own constituency, Darndale estate and Swan's Nest Court estate in Kilbarrack. One of the results is that there are fewer opportunities on the housing list since people coming from the estates which have been demolished or refurbished are joining the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year in Dublin city there are only 230 units of newly built houses for the local authority public sector area and only 70 houses being purchased in the social area.  After 2000, so far as I understand it, no sites will be available for local authority housing in Dublin city.  One of the reasons for this has been the policy pursued by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and some of his predecessors in respect of the artificial division <Col N="570" /> of Dublin into four counties with four separate housing responsibilities so that the city area is totally landlocked with no provision for housing. The city manager and the city council are facing a crisis which was discussed today at a meeting at City Hall for some hours.  I represent the Fingal ward of Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle.  On my file I have approximately 200 low income families from the fishing community, in particular, in Howth who are desperately seeking accommodation. This Government is prepared to give them the princely total of seven &mdash; five one-bed and two bedroom &mdash; houses.  This is an absolute disgrace. The whole approach of Fingal County Council in addition to the Government's approach in relation to the housing needs of lower income persons is inflexible and unresponsive.  The Minister should have a word with Fingal county manager and the housing manager and ask them to live up to their important responsibilities under the housing Acts to look after people who urgently need it.</P>
    <P>We have had a report today from Dublin City Council which covered some of the areas to which the Minister will probably refer, infill development, over shop development, home improvement loans and expediting the service of underdeveloped lands.  Even allowing for all that we need a fundamental response from the Minister. The Bacon report was merely the first chapter out of about eight or nine initiatives which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, should have taken if they were serious about trying to address the housing crisis. We need to look at the four Dublin counties as one area.  I do not understand the reason we do not have common housing allocation lists for families because families, certainly between Fingal and Dublin city, are seeking accommodation but do not know to which county they belong.  It could be argued that there should be a major plan.  Dublin city and Fingal county councils are reviewing their development plans.  There should be a major plan to look at housing needs not only in the four Dublin counties but in the surrounding counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, because that area with a population of 1.3 million to 1.5 million is beginning to operate as a single housing area.  It needs an initiative from Government which has allowed the situation to slide and is not prepared to take the necessary decisive action.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that there is a problem of supply and demand and we do not have enough supply.  The initiatives which the Minister has taken in relation to the shared ownership scheme, other social housing responses and the responses put in train as a result of the Bacon report have not got to grips with the situation, particularly for low income families, due to the explosion in house prices in Dublin.  I understand that today there was a record in house prices, a residential home changed hands for something of the order of £5 million in Dalkey.  Even the shared ownership scheme offers a loan of only £40,000 or <Col N="571" /> £50,000 with repayments of, perhaps, £100 from somebody earning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin city and in Fingal there is an urgent housing crisis, especially for lower income families.  This will be a major issue in the next general election, sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for selecting this item, with Deputy Broughan's.  There is a national housing crisis and the sooner the Minister and the Government recognise that and respond accordingly the sooner we will be able to respond to the huge demand in society for housing.</P>
      <P>The specific issue I wish to bring to the attention of the House relates to a proposal to establish a national commission on housing.  Fine Gael welcomes a recent call by five national housing organisations to establish such a commission.  This proposal has come directly from people who see on a daily basis the housing conditions and the ever increasing demand for affordable accommodation. It is not an exaggeration to suggest the crisis in the housing market reached fever pitch during the past year or so, particularly in the reign of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minster of State, Deputy Molloy, to respond favourably to the proposals from Threshold, Focus Ireland, St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community and Sonas Housing Association to establish a national commission on housing. Such a commission could report to Government within a relatively short period on the plight of people on low incomes who are chasing an inadequate supply of affordable accommodation in the city and country.  In their communique they pinpoint exactly the problems in the housing market: 40,000 households are in receipt of the SWA rent allowance &mdash; these people are living at the lower end of the private rented sector which is becoming increasingly expensive, often of poor quality, largely unregistered accommodation which is subject to almost a negligible level of monitoring or even the most basic form of standards &mdash; the inability of the private rented sector to provide accommodation that is affordable, habitable and offers security of tenure and some stability to rental costs; and the lack of appropriate housing for the homeless &mdash; the <i>Evening Herald</i> highlights the crisis in relation to homelessness every evening of the week.  It is a terrible blight on society that we have not been able to manage that issue, given the wealth in our country; the lack of adequate funding arrangements to cover the management and running costs of sheltered housing, hostels and settlement services; the increasing cost of construction is putting continued stress on capital funding arrangements for social housing schemes.  There are many excellent housing schemes but they cannot be built because those in the building industry want to <Col N="572" /> move on to more lucrative parts of that industry and there are not sufficient people to do the work in the construction industry.  As I said six months ago, 30,000 applicants on the housing list represents over 100,000 people seeking a home. There is a lack of housing options available to those released from prison, the elderly and separated persons.  One of the major problems in my constituency is that there are single men who will never get any form of accommodation from South Dublin County Council.  They are separated and living away from their children.  This is leading to further alienation.  There is a lack of funding for the provision of recreation, culture and shopping developments.  There is a lack of control in respect of the upper income house purchasers moving to rural areas and transforming the property market to the exclusion of low to middle income persons.</P>
    <P>While the Bacon report and the subsequent response by Government may help middle income persons to obtain a home, the reality for thousands of low income persons is somewhat different.</P>
    <P>The view of the organisations which proposed a national commission is that the response of Government to the housing issue to date has, unfortunately concentrated on only one dimension of the problem.  If we fail to grasp the fact that during the past 18 months local authority housing lists have increased by over 30 per cent, that individuals on average incomes can no longer purchase any form of accommodation, that rents are now escalating beyond reasonable levels, that homelessness is on the increase and unless we begin to recognise how severely these facts are impinging on the supply of decent and affordable accommodation we will all have failed to discharge the most fundamental objective of society, to provide shelter for all.</P>
    <P>The population is on the increase.  By 2006 it is expected there will be 4.4 million people living here.  That figure is even more dramatic when one considers that over 30,000 new homes must be built every year between now and 2006.  The work of a commission on housing would not only address the immediate problems in the market but would begin to put in place long-term strategic planning to deal with the housing crisis, which this Government has so badly neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters and affording me the opportunity to indicate some of the positive measures being taken by the Government in the housing area.  First, I indicate my concern to ensure that appropriate housing is available to lower income households, not only in Dublin city and Fingal, but throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Government's concern that rapidly increasing house prices were putting house purchase beyond the reach of many lower income house purchasers who reasonably <Col N="573" /> aspired to owning their own houses.  The Government commissioned and had brought to conclusion within a tight timeframe the Bacon report on house prices.  Moreover, at the same time as publishing the Bacon report the Government also announced a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the problem of rising house prices.  The Government's action on house prices was a comprehensive response designed to restore order to the housing market, in particular by increasing the supply of serviced land for housing, reducing speculative demand by investors and specific measures to assist lower income and first time purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Government's action on house prices contains a number of important measures to assist first time buyers.  First time buyers of existing houses have benefited significantly from reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower house price levels.  Stamp duty has been abolished on houses priced up to £60,000, which is important in rural areas.  The rate of stamp duty on houses priced between £60,001 and £100,000 has been halved to 3 per cent and the overall package of stamp duty reductions will improve mobility in the second-hand house market and as a result increase the supply of these houses available to first time buyers.</P>
    <P>The improvements which have been made to the local authority shared ownership scheme are specifically designed to help lower income first time buyers.  The income limit has been increased from £15,000 to £20,000 for a single income household with a corresponding increase for two income households.  The removal of fiscal incentives to investors, who were even buying up former local authority houses and pricing low income buyers out of the market, have also improved the prospects of first time buyers.</P>
    <P>While the full effect of some of the measures will only be seen in the medium term, positive effects of the Government's action have been reported by many commentators.  For example, auctioneers and estate agents are increasingly reporting a significant easing of house prices in the market generally and have in particular highlighted the fact that first time buyers have reclaimed the starter home market which had become increasingly dominated by investors during the previous Government's term of office</P>
    <P>The Government has not lost sight of those for whom home ownership, even through measures such as shared ownership, is not an option.  &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; sets out the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  A programme of 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions has been notified to local authorities for 1998.  The capital provision of some £213 million is 19 per cent up on last year.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation and FingaCounty Council received £49 million, excluding £20 million for the redevelopment of Ballymun, for which the outgoing Government did not provide one penny.  The increase in funding provided for the programme in 1998 reflects the Government's commitment to maintaining the housing programme at a high level.  The local authority housing programme is being monitored and I have stressed the need for authorities to take all necessary steps to enable the housing programme for the year to be progressed rapidly and to ensure that the full output for the year is achieved.</P>
      <P>Also, authorities have been called upon to renew their efforts to exploit the full potential of the range of social housing measures now available to them, such as voluntary housing and shared ownership.  The direct provision of housing forms part of the overall response to social housing needs.  To supplement the traditional programme and to diversify the response to housing needs, each local authority has a responsibility to utilise, to the maximum extent possible, the range of available measures.  Output from these measures made a significant contribution to meeting social housing needs in 1997 and I will continue to urge local authorities to promote the schemes and extend their scope within their areas.  Recent improvements in the terms of the social housing schemes should help to increase output from these measures.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the local authority housing programme, with the output from complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable the needs of some 10,000 households to be catered for in 1998, about one quarter of which would be in the Dublin city and Fingal areas.</P>
      <P>I have only recently received a copy of the joint statement by five voluntary housing organisations seeking the establishment of a national commission on housing.  The statement referred to a wide range of housing issues and I am not certain how they all might be tackled within a single framework or what positive contribution a commission might make in addressing issues ranging, for example, from accommodation and services for the homeless to the problems caused by upper income house purchasers moving to rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the housing sector has experienced the effects of the social and economic change which is under way in Ireland.  Increased affluence, the increase in population due to Irish people returning from abroad, other inward immigration and natural demographic change have increased demand for all forms of housing, including private rented accommodation and social housing, especially in the cites and surrounding counties.  Housing output has responded strongly to these demands with record levels of completions in each of the past three years, reaching almost 39,000 in 1998.  We are building at a faster rate relative to population than any country in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the reported difficulties for <Col N="575" /> people on lower incomes securing adequate housing, the next assessment of housing needs, to be carried out by local authorities in March 1999, will be particularly important as a basis for the future planning of the Government's response to social housing needs.  My Department will issue detailed guidelines on the conduct of the assessment to local authorities in the autumn.  Detailed guidelines will also issue in relation to carrying out a separate assessment of homelessness which will be crucial to improving our understanding of the nature and extent of the problem and in devising the most appropriate strategies.</P>
    <P>In our year in office the Government has faced new and significant challenges in the housing area and has responded with urgent and decisive action.  I assure Deputies that this will continue to be our approach.  The position outlined by the Deputies has been inherited from their parties when they were in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter concerning the events of 14 May and 9 June 1998 at Keel Garda Station, Achill, County Mayo, involving the replacement of a Garda telecommunications mast, plus additional facilities provided by Esat Digiphone.  I am aware of the agreement between Esat and the gardaí on this matter and there is no need to recount the details &mdash; I was part of the Government which agreed that process.  Nor will I refer to the controversy and uncertainty about electromagnetic wave levels and fears for health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo is, by and large, a law abiding county, Achill is a law abiding community and Keel is a peaceful location.  I respect the work of the gardaí <Col N="576" /> and their right to decide, in the best interests of community harmony, how particular policing decisions should be carried out, but equally I respect the right of a community to know what is happening.  This difficulty has been caused by lack of communication, lack of presentation, failure to explain what was going on, and a lack of common sense on the part of Esat, the gardaí and, in some cases, the local community.</P>
    <P>On the afternoon of 13 May, Esat workmen began putting up the mast at Keel Garda station. Two vans were pulled across the entrance to the Garda station and the Garda squad car, returning from duty on Achill Sound Bridge was forced to pull into a neighbouring driveway.  Garda Howley then discovered that a large container, known as a cabinet, was placed 16 feet from the back window of the Garda station.  This structure measured ten feet six inches by eight feet four inches by nine feet high.  A crane hoisted the mast into position.  When Garda Howley saw this, after inquiring with the supervisor in charge, he rang the planning office in Castlebar.  Instructions were given to the workmen to remove themselves from the site and the mast was taken down later that evening because it may have been in a dangerous position.</P>
    <P>On the following day, I assume because of involvement in this matter, Garda Howley was informed he was being transferred to Westport as a matter for Garda operations &mdash; this after 34 years service.  When this emerged on Mid West Radio, a crowd of about 300 people from the locality gathered at Keel Garda station, demonstrating their loyalty to the Garda in question and the fact that they were not informed about the matter.</P>
    <P>On 9 June 1998, gardaí were summoned to Castlebar at 5 a.m. to proceed to Achill to carry out an operation.  The gardaí were issued with riot shields and helmets and later ringed the perimeter fence of the Garda station.  At one stage 81 gardaí were present and five back-up squad cars at Achill Sound a number of miles away.  Five people were arrested and questions were asked about the conditions of the regulations of their arrest.</P>
    <P>People are loyal to the Garda Síochána and they trust and respect them.  I do not want that loyalty and trust diminished because of lack of information or lack of consultation with the public. Therefore, I wish to ask a number of questions which will not be answered in the Minister's prepared script.  I ask him to ask the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give me the answers to these questions, either by briefing or in writing.</P>
    <P>Why were gardaí summoned to Castlebar at 5 a.m. on 9 June to carry out an operation which I will refer to as Operation Keel Mast?  Who instructed, and for what reason, that riot gear, including helmets and shields, be supplied to and carried by gardaí inside the perimeter fence? Were reports received and recorded in Westport Garda station that Keel Garda station was to be <Col N="577" /> bombed, as has been allegedly reported?  Were Garda communications operational to best standards in the Achill area when the Keel mast was not in commission?  Is it true that channel seven can supply standard communication without channel 31, which is the normal channel used by Keel Garda station?</P>
    <P>Why did Esat not communicate with gardaí that this replacement was to take place?  Why was it not explained to the local community what was taking place?  Was planning permission issued for Keel Garda station in the first instance &mdash; I had the privilege to open it prior to the last election? Do the replacement masts and added facilities constitute exempted development?  What is Garda Howley's position?  Is he still attached to Keel Garda station as he has in his possession a document handed to him, instructing his transfer to Westport?</P>
    <P>Are there conditions attached to the continued opening of Keel Garda station and the presence of gardaí there?  Is there a method by which Esat can be accommodated in terms of the agreement between gardaí and Esat in this instance, by service from Minaun Heights which overlooks the Achill area, where a large telecommunications and television mast already exists?</P>
    <P>With Deputy Ring, the chairman of Mayo County Council, Councillor Kilbane, and Deputy Joe Higgins, I attended a meeting in Achill last week.  There was a great deal of confusion and unrest there and a legal case is being taken.  While the Minister does not have the answers in his script, perhaps he will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reply to my questions in full as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would like to thank the Deputy for giving him the opportunity to deal with this matter.  However, before dealing with the specific issue raised by the Deputy it might of some assistance if I outline the background to the agreement concluded with Esat Digifone, the second licensed mobile phone operator, under which they have been permitted to use Garda radio masts or sites.</P>
      <P>The arrangement arose from an approach made to the Garda authorities by Esat Digifone in September 1996, with a proposal to co-locate mobile telephony equipment on Garda radio masts or sites in the context of their planned mobile telephone network.  Digifone indicated that in return they were prepared to pay the full rental value of the sites involved in addition to providing facilities and services to the Garda Síochána which would be of significant operational and strategic value to them.  I will return to this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities considered the arrangement proposed by Esat to be technically feasible and of significant benefit to them in terms of their own plans for the future development of their radio and telecommunications network.  Given the strong support for the proposal by the Garda authorities, and mindful of the desire to avoid a <Col N="578" /> proliferation of such masts, as recommended in the Guidelines for Local Planning Authorities on the siting of Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures, which were issued by the Department of the Environment in July 1996, the previous Government, of which Deputy Kenny was a member, approved the proposal, subject to Esat Digifone complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a contractual agreement was concluded with Digifone in early 1997 under which they are permitted to use up to 418 out of a total 704 Garda station sites i.e. approximately 59 per cent of all Garda stations.  The Garda station at Keel was among the 418 sites identified by Esat Digifone as being of interest to them and was accordingly comprehended by the agreement with the company.  The Minister understands that the proposed replacement of the existing Garda mast at Keel by Esat Digifone with a more robust structure, is an exempt development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the contract concluded with Digifone, the Minister would not be entitled to refuse them access to Garda sites, except for a contravention by the company of any of the above mentioned conditions.  The Minister wishes to point out that the decision to allow Esat Digifone access to Garda sites was not taken lightly, that careful and detailed consideration was given to the Esat Digifone proposal and that the agreement with them is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment.  Should any doubt arise in this regard it would be a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the relevant planning authorities to consider.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the reason it was necessary to have a large Garda presence to carry out duty at Keel Garda Station, Achill, County Mayo on Tuesday, 9 June 1998 was because it was necessary to replace the Garda mast at Keel Station for Garda communications purposes.</P>

      <P>During the course of the work in the replacement of the Garda mast, a number of protesters gathered in the area and were obstructing works being carried out.  The number of gardaí deployed was necessary to stop protesters from preventing the necessary works which are an essential element in the policing service. As Deputy Kenny knows, decisions of this nature are, of course, an operational matter for the Commissioner and his senior officers.</P>

      <P>A sign of the strength of democracy in any society is how it looks after the voiceless. I have been asked to be a voice for 22 mildly or moderately handicapped pupils from the Youghal area of County Cork.  Each day they must travel in a minibus from Youghal to Cork city to receive an education.  Some of these children are picked up at 7 a.m. and returned home as late as 5.15 p.m. I am sure the Minister will agree that this is a long day even for children without special needs.  The bus has a seating capacity of 16 yet it caters for 22 children each day.  In some cases, they have to travel more than 40 miles every morning and evening.  Unlike normal children these children believe pinching a colleague is funny.  There is no escort on the bus and the driver cannot supervise them.  A mother told me recently that her daughter came home from school covered in pinch marks.  Another child who travels on the bus is a severe epileptic. What would happen if that child had a fit on the bus?  The driver could not cope, he cannot even communicate with anyone.  Because there are not enough seats on bus, the children cannot use safety belts.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science will provide a larger bus with an escort and, where possible, shorten the journey time involved.  I am not criticising anybody in this regard.  I have been in communication with Department officials on this matter and they have been outstanding in their response.  CIE is also concerned about the problem.</P>
      <P>I know decisions on such matters are usually made during the summer.  That is why I have raised this matter on the Adjournment tonight. Will the Minister provide funding for an escort on the bus?  I know from a reply I received in recent weeks on a similar matter that all Members are concerned about these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The windows on the bus cannot be opened because the driver is afraid someone will be hurt. The parents must balance the safety and health of their children against their education.  They do not know which is the greater evil.  The children cannot learn properly if they are upset when they arrive at school, but they have a right to an education under our Constitution.  To quote a Phil Coulter song, &ldquo;Scorn not his simplicity but rather try to love him all the more&rdquo;.  I am sure all <Col N="580" /> Members are at one in achieving the best possible facilities for these children.  I raise the matter tonight so that by September the children will have a proper sized bus with an escort and safety harnesses.  I am confident the Minister will do the best he can in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns about transport raised by a number of parents of children with special needs who attend special schools in Cork.  Officials of the Department of Education and Science have contacted Bus Éireann regarding the issues raised and have requested that the current school transport service for these children be reviewed with a view to resolving the parents' concerns.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised including the provision of escorts and the current policy of having three children on the bus for every two adult seats, were considered by the School Transport Review Committee.  This committee undertook a very comprehensive study of the entire school transport scheme.  The committee's report, published in January 1998, was circulated to all relevant and interested parties.  Its contents have given rise to very extensive debate and a number of responses have been received.  These are currently under examination in the Department. Serious consideration will be given to the outcome of this debate before we make final decisions or implement changes to the school transport scheme.  I await the outcome of this process with interest.</P>
      <P>However, I assure the Deputy that children attending special schools and classes are given special consideration in the matter of transport to school.  This is in recognition of the nature of the disabilities involved and the relatively dispersed locations from which many of the children concerned have to travel to school.  The Department makes every effort, within available resources, to provide these pupils with a home pick up-set down service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that all publicly funded schemes have to operate within tight financial constraints.  Due to the high cost of some school transport services and the inconvenience to other pupils, it is not always possible to provide a home pick up-set down service.  Where such a service is not available, the Department can sanction a grant in respect of private transport arrangements to the nearest pick up point.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the matters raised by the parents of these children will be fully considered by the Department in the context of the outcome of the review of the transport service to and from Youghal currently being undertaken by Bus Éireann.</P>

      <P>The clothing and textiles industries worldwide are experiencing severe competitive pressures. Change is constant and in that environment there are no guarantees; that is the reality of the business world.  The clothing industry in western Europe has been declining in the face of competition from low-cost countries.  This, coupled with liberalising world trade, has resulted in clothing companies in Europe and the US to seek cheaper sources of production.  For example, Fruit of the Loom has been engaged in the retrenchment of its US-based operatives for some time.</P>

      <P>I would refer Deputies to the Government's employment action plan, agreed by the Government last April and subsequently published and laid before this House.</P>
      <P>The employment action plan sets out, in detail, the strategy the Government intends to follow in regard to the adoption of a preventative strategy whereby there will be early intervention with all young and adult unemployed, within six and 12 months respectively of their becoming unemployed, with a view to offering them a job or other employability support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the programme will concentrate on the under 25s once they cross the six months live register threshold.  The programme <Col N="583" /> will be implemented by means of co-operation between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the FÁS employment services, and utilising also the services available from the local employment service.  It is intended to introduce this process systematically from September 1998.</P>
    <P>The overall financial provision available for the employability pillar of the EU guidelines, under which this particular initiative falls, is just under £900 million.</P>
    <P>Already a Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation has been agreed between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and procedures for operational co-operation will be further developed in a series of protocols between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>The further phased extension of this programme to over 25s who have been unemployed for one year will obviously be informed by the experience of operating the first phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>The legal basis governing the rights and obligations of unemployed persons seeking work is set out in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regulations adopted by statutory instrument in May of this year.  My Department did participate in the discussions on the regulations which I also understand, were discussed with the appropriate Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>The programme of systematic engagement with under 25s will offer quality supports to the young people in question.  It is a positive and preventative strategy, and is not intended to be punitive. However, if in the course of this process individuals are identified whose circumstances are such that their entitlements fall to be reviewed, for example, because they turn down reasonable offers of a training or employment scheme place, that is also a good outcome of the programme. Any review of such an individual case will be consistent with the regulations and the guidelines I have referred to and will be undertaken by a statutorily independent deciding officer.  As a further safeguard in the event of a decision to terminate payment there is an appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>At the end of this process if an individual is deemed not to be eligible for an unempoyment payment &mdash; because he or she is not genuinely available for employment or not genuinely seeking employment and has an adult dependant and child dependants, that adult dependant can apply for supplementary welfare allowance for herself or himself and his or her children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been assigned responsibility for the year 2000 business awareness campaign, since January last.  This is an informal assignment and is not therefore covered by the order delegating ministeristal functions.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computers systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their particular systems and to determine the solution.  It is important that Irish businesses address the issue immediately, as the cost of ignoring the problem could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem at this stage.</P>
      <P>Where the Government can help is in raising awareness of the issue and by providing guidelines to businesses to help them tackle the problem. Approximately 100,000 copies of an awareness leaflet on the year 2000 computer problem, prepared by our Department in June 1997, with the assistance of Forfás and IBEC, have been distributed to industry, chambers of commerce and county and city enterprise boards &lsquo;CCEBs&rsquo; throughout the country.  This leaflet suggests initial steps to be taken to enable industries IT systems deal with the date change.</P>
      <P>Some recent research on the year 2000 problem has indicated that, while there is a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action to deal with the problem, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is required.  Accordingly on May 6 last, I launched a National Business Awareness Campaign, with which I am personally involved.  A further and more comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it has been, and is being circulated to businesses both directly and indirectly through industrial development agencies, county and city enterprise boards and chambers of commerce.  I arranged to have copies of this brouchure circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  In addition a series of regional public meetings have been held to highlight awareness of the problem.  I have personally impressed on participants at these meetings the urgency of the need to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Our Department and I myself, have also had discussion with representatives of the financial sector, the insurance industry, the accountancy bodies and others including the IT sector to seek their assistance in highlighting the need for Irish businesses to take action.  These interests have agreed to support the Government's campaign and I have established a national steering committee representing a range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to oversee the campaign and implement it at the level of their constituent membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am responsible only for the year 2000 business awareness campaign, I am aware that our efforts in this campaign are having an impact <Col N="585" /> among public bodies and in Government generally. Each member of the Government has ministerial responsibility for tackling the issue within his or her Department and the public sector bodies under its aegis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Auditor regulation is delegated at present to six accountancy bodies which are individually recognised by our Department under section 191 of the Companies Act, 1990.  Arising from the findings of the McCracken Tribunal report last year, one of these bodies, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, ICAI, decided to establish a committee of inquiry to investigate a number of its members.  In order to allow us to review on an independent basis the deliberations of the committee of inquiry, we amended the institute's terms of recognition last October so as to secure unrestricted access to its proceedings by an official of our Department.  Subsequently, we added a similar condition to our recognition of <Col N="586" /> the other accountancy bodies.  We have also taken a number of other initiatives in relation to the profession.  At our request, all recognised accountancy bodies have agreed to report suspected breaches of the Companies Acts which come to their attention during the course of their disciplinary proceedings to our Department.</P>
      <P>I have also requested each recognised accountancy body to provide to our Department a standard and more detailed set of statistical and other information in its annual reports for 1998 and subsequent years, particularly in relation to its investigation of complaints against those members practising as auditors in the State. These returns will be critically evaluated by our Department to enable us to assess the performance of each of the recognised accountancy bodies in this important area.</P>
      <P>Our dissatisfaction with the obvious inadequacies of the present regime of self-regulation is well known.  At the same time, many of the recognised accounting bodies have acknowledged to us that their disciplinary procedures require revision to achieve greater openness and transparency.  We are pleased that at our prompting, a number of the accounting bodies have already revised their procedures in this area.  At the end of the day however, we will judge the effectiveness of these arrangements by the level of penalties, which are applied in cases of serious misconduct.  In this context, the ongoing work of the ICAI's committee of inquiry will be an important test of the merits, or otherwise, of self-regulation in the accountancy profession.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that the Moriarty Tribunal of Inquiry is required to address in its deliberations the effective regulation of the accountancy profession.  We intend that our Department will seek limited representation at the tribunal at an appropriate time to address these and other matters of relevance to company law.  The Deputy can be assured that we will not hesitate to take appropriate action if such becomes necessary, in order to restore public confidence in the accountancy profession.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 21, 37, 47 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in replies to parliamentary questions on this matter on 26 May last, the difficulties on the employment front associated with the growing practice of Sunday trading were the subject of a discussion process earlier this year between IBEC and trade union interests, including the unions primarily concerned, SIPTU and MANDATE, under an agreed independent chairman.</P>
      <P>The report from the independent chairman on the outcome of this discussion process, which I received in May indicated that the parties involved accepted that a code of practice along lines proposed by the chairman could, without prejudicing the fundamental position of either side, form the basis of a common and voluntary approach to practice in relation to retail sector Sunday working.</P>
      <P>I have accepted the thrust of this report and have requested the Labour Relations Commission pursuant to section 35 (2) of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, to prepare a code of practice on Sunday working in the retail trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be discussing with the LRC the time scale for the preparation of this code.  It is my intention to declare, by order, the code to be a code of practice for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  I am confident that this proposed code will provide a satisfactory basis for the development of future Sunday working arrangements that will be to the mutual advantage of employers and employees. <Col N="588" /></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> The allocation of resources to facilitate employers with training for their employees has been increased in 1998.</P>
    <P>A sum of £15.987 million has been provided in my Department's 1998 Estimates for training for the employed.  This allocation primarily funds the training support scheme and the apprenticeship programme.  The 1998 Exchequer allocation of £15.987 million represents an increase of approximately 95 per cent on the 1997 provision of £8.2 million.  In addition, a total of £36 million is provided to FÁS from the European Social Fund for these measures up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in 1998 for the introduction of a training networks programme, which will facilitate employers to determine their human resources requirements and invest in training for their employees.  A sum of £2 million has been made available for the initiative in 1998 and will be supplemented by a further £2.25 million approximately which is being made available to the programme from the European Social Fund up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the resources available from FÁS to assist employers to train their workforce is appropriate having regard to all the demands on the public purse.  While a substantial proportion of the remaining £400 million plus in FÁS's budget is used to finance the community employment scheme, I am satisfied that employers also benefit significantly from the £46.6 million and its associated European Social Fund component which is used to finance specific skills courses and other training programmes for the unemployed which address the needs of the labour market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to protecting the general health and safety of all workers does not lie in changing or amending what is fundamentally strong legislation &mdash; it lies in changing attitudes and particularly those of a certain minority of employers to health and safety management and in ensuring that they meet all their obligations, both legal and moral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an extensive and comprehensive block of health and safety legislation in Ireland which adequately meets the requirements necessary to protect our workforce and which conforms to best international practices.  Measures such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, Act 1989, <Col N="590" /> the 1993 General Application Regulations andthe 1995 Construction Regulations provide a solid legislative framework by which effective health and safety management can be ensured and by which high standards can be set.  In addition these measures are updated, supplemented and strengthened as European Union directives come on stream and are transposed into Irish law. Regulations to give effect to a number of such directives are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety and it sets out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities which employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. Under this legislation, it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.  The 1989 Act is supplemented by a series of Regulations, in particular the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 1995.  The former extend the requirements of the Act and lay down provisions for health and safety in specific aspects of working activity such as the workplace, the use by workers of work equipment and personal protective equipment, manual handling of loads and work with display screen equipment.  The latter is one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one sector.</P>
    <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. This ongoing enforcement is carried out in a pro-active manner.  The authority works to a targeted annual national programme, as approved by its tripartite management board, as well as regularly reviewing and focusing on sectors with high accident rates.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act is kept under review both by my Department and by the authority as regards its applicability and effectiveness.  I have asked the authority to advise me particularly on its experience of enforcing the Act over the past ten years. Should it be concluded that regulation in this area would benefit from development of or change to the legislation, I can assure the Deputy that the necessary steps will be taken.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady increase in the funding and staff allocated to the authority since its inception. In 1990 Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million.  With regard to staffing, the authority currently has Government sanction for 119 people. However, a further comprehensive submission has been submitted by the authority to my Department in relation to future staffing needs, and this is currently being discussed between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of Finance. <Col N="591" /></P>

      <P>As I previously outlined to the House, Guinness Ireland Group voluntarily notified its proposed takeover of United Beverages Holdings to the Competition Authority on 4 September 1997 seeking clearance of the proposal under the Competition Acts.  This ensured that the proposal would be subjected to a thorough investigation by an independent authority and rendered it unnecessary for me to exercise my powers under the Competition Acts.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority has yet to issue a statement on the matter and accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to comment while the matter is in the hands of the independent statutory authority.</P>

      <P>I met with Mr. William Farley, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fruit of the Loom Inc., on 23 June 1998 in Chicago to discuss the US company's plans for its Irish operations.  This was my fourth meeting with him since taking office last year.</P>
      <P>The clothing and textiles industries worldwide are experiencing severe competitive pressures. Change is constant and in that environment there are no guarantees; that is the reality of the business world.  The clothing industry in western Europe has been declining in the face of competition from low-cost countries.  This, coupled with liberalising world trade, has resulted in clothing companies in Europe and the US to seek cheaper sources of production.  For example, Fruit of the Loom has been engaged in the retrenchment of its US-based operatives for some time.</P>
      <P>Mr. Farley indicated to me that he is keeping the business in Donegal under constant review in the light of market forces.  He stated that he will be visiting Donegal shortly as part of this review process.  He will keep in touch with IDA Ireland and myself as the review progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Motorola, I met with senior management in Motorola on Tuesday 23 June 1998.  I strongly represented the case for the <Col N="592" /> Motorola operations in Dublin and Cork and hope that these representations will assist in maximising employment in Ireland arising from Motorola's global restructuring plans.</P>
    <P>Both companies remain committed to Ireland as a base for their operations as long as it remains a competitive location to do so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 34 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>On 4 June 1998, I received an interim report from Mr. Martin Cosgrove, the authorised officer who was appointed on 23 March last under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989 to investigate possible breaches of insurance legislation in relation to National Irish Bank Limited.  and its associated companies.  Having taken legal advice on Mr. Cosgrove's interim report, I have in recent weeks furnished copies to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the inspectors to National Irish Bank Limited.  and the Revenue Commissioners for their consideration.</P>
      <P>As a result of information contained in Mr. Cosgrove's interim report, I determined that it was both necessary and appropriate to seek the appointment of a High Court inspector to examine the affairs of National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited.</P>
      <P>The High Court granted my petition in this regard on 15 June, and the remit of the inspectors to National Irish Bank Limited.  now extends to its associated company.  As a result of this decision.  Mr. Cosgrove's investigation is now being suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> Also on 10 June last, the Inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd.  presented their first interim report to the High Court at a sitting held <i>in camera</i> and the court ordered that the report be kept confidential.  However, in accordance with the court order, a copy of the Inspectors' interim report has been made available to my Department. As a result of a number of legal issues which have arisen in relation to the conduct of their investigation, the Inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd.  have now sought certain directions from the court.  The specific relief sought by the Inspectors includes:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a determination that persons (whether natural or legal) from whom information, documents or evidence are sought are not entitled to refuse to answer questions put by the Inspectors or to refuse to provide documents to the Inspectors on the grounds that the answers or documents may tend to incriminate them and</P>
    <P>&mdash; a determination that the procedures proposed to be employed by the Inspectors are consistent with the requirements of natural and constitutional justice.</P>
    <P>A hearing of the High Court took place on 25 and 26 June to consider the Inspectors' request, and submissions were also made on these matters by counsel acting for a representative employee of National Irish Bank Limited.  In addition, both the bank itself and I are legally represented as notice parties at the hearing, which has resumed today.</P>
    <P>As the matters involved are <i>sub judice</i>, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can confirm that on completion by the Inspectors of their investigations, I intend to seek directions from the High Court under section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990 that the State be reimbursed in full by National Irish Bank Limited.  and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited.  for the cost of the Inspectors' investigations into both companies and for the legal costs of my petitions to the Court.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Bell Lines shipping company and four related companies were wound up <Col N="594" /> by order of the High Court on 4 July 1997 and that a liquidator was subsequently appointed.</P>
      <P>The liquidator is at present discharging his statutory functions, which include winding up the company, inquiring into its affairs and realising and distributing its assets.  In addition, the liquidator has the responsibility to investigate the reasons for the liquidation and subsequently to apprise the High Court of the pertinent issues. On consideration of the liquidator's report, the court may declare, under section 150 of the Companies Act, 1990, that a person who was a director of the company shall not, for a period of five years, be appointed or act in any way as a director or secretary of any company, or otherwise be concerned or take part in the promotion or formation of any company, unless he meets certain strict requirements.  Under section 160 of the same Act, the court also has the power to disqualify such persons from acting as directors, officers or promoters of any company for certain periods.</P>
      <P>As the case is still subject to the High Court and as creditors have the right to have their views made known to the court at the appropriate time, it would not be appropriate to duplicate under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990, the investigative work which the liquidator is required by law to undertake in discharging his own statutory duties.</P>

      <P>In recently welcoming the publication of the 1997 Annual Report of the Director of Consumer Affairs, I indicated that the staffing of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs had been the subject of extensive discussion between the director and my Department, in the course of which the director was informed of departmental concern about the utilisation of existing resources. Measures were agreed to address this concern, including the appointment of a senior official to assist the director in the management of the office and the commissioning of a consultancy exercise to examine the practices and procedures employed in the office.  The senior official has recently taken up duty and discussions are under way concerning the consultancy exercise.  I have assured the Director that I wish to ensure that adequate resources are available to enable him to properly discharge his statutory functions.</P>

    <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, requires that any credit institution proposing to increase existing charges and/or to impose new charges on customers in the period of the changeover to the euro formally notify the Director of Consumer <Col N="595" /> Affairs.  The Act empowers the director to direct institutions to refrain from imposing or changing a charge in relation to the provision of a service to a customer or group of customers and additionally to publish, in such manner as he may specify, information on any charge for the provision of a service.  To date, the director has not received any notifications specifically related to the changeover to the euro.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 66 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland grants are, at present, entirely funded by the Exchequer.  During the last year, the modest EU co-financing from Structural Funds for the Inward Investment Sub-Programme for the 1994-99 Industry Operational Programme was terminated by my Department and EU funds transferred to other programmes.</P>
      <P>Under new Regional State Aid Rules adopted by the Commission in December 1997, IDA Ireland schemes will operate under maxima yet to be determined with the Commission.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the new ceilings for Ireland will be agreed with the Commission in the first half of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasis that, in most cases, IDA Ireland aid levels are well within the existing limits. It is my intention that, regardless of any future changes in maximum grant levels, Ireland will continue to be in a position to attract the high levels of inward investment by virtue of the continuing attractiveness of Ireland to foreign companies in terms of grant packages, a vibrant and <Col N="596" /> pro-business business environment and our highly educated English speaking workforce.</P>
    <P>As regards the notion of rationing grants, IDA Ireland is obliged to ration grants as part of its normal operations to ensure that the country receives value for money for public supports to inward investment.</P>

      <P>The rapid employment growth of recent years has inevitably led to a tightening of the labour market.  The Government is fully aware of the importance of each sector having available to it an adequate pool of personnel equipped with the appropriate skills if the economy is to develop to its full potential and contribute to overall economic growth.  Since taking up office, the Government has taken a broad range of relevant initiatives. These include: the establishment of a new business, education and training partnership embodying an expert group on future skills needs and an implementation group.  The expert group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Chris Horn of Iona Technologies, has just recently presented its first report relating to skills needs in the electronic and software areas.  The Implementation Group is now proceeding to identify the steps to be taken to meet supply needs in these areas; the development of a skills awareness programme aimed at making school-goers aware of where future job opportunities lie; the allocation, shortly after entering office, of an extra £5 million to commence the expansion of student in-take in computing and technician courses, with a view to achieving an increased annual output of 1,000 computer graduates and 750 technicians; the establishment of a £250 million education technology investment fund; the allocation of £1.2 million to FÁS to expand its provision in the software and electronics areas; and extra provision for FÁS to meet increasing apprenticeship numbers from some 3,000 in 1994 to over 5,500 in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are just some of the initiatives we have taken over the past year.  I am confident that these measures, together with the ongoing programmes being undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education and Science, will ensure that skills shortages are minimised and that the Irish labour force will obtain the full benefit of the anticipated employment expansion. <Col N="597" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 51 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Since I last replied to questions on this matter on 26 May last, I have received information from the authorised officer which has led to my appointing him on 9 June last to examine the books and documents of Kentford Securities Limited., an Irish-registered company which was dissolved in May, 1995.  While the nature of this information must remain confidential for the present, I can advise the House that in accordance with legal advice, the basis for Mr. Ryan's appointment to the company comprehended the circumstances indentified in paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (b)(ii) and (f) of section 19(2) of the Act.</P>
      <P>It is not possible for me to be more specific about the nature of this information at this time. Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, imposes severe constraints on the publication or disclosure of information received on foot of investigations like those of Mr. Ryan which are being conducted under section 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
      <P>I have received no response of any kind to my appeal to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.  to reconsider its stance of non co-operation with Mr. Ryan's investigation of its books and documents. Some indication of the company's position may become known shortly when the Grand Court formally settles the order confirming its earlier decision.  The House can be assured that I will be keeping in close touch with developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> The investigation costs incurred by Mr. Ryan which have been borne by my Department amount to about £6,965 to date.  These comprise £4,530 for travel and subsistence, £1,552 for document search and retrieval costs and £874 for certain incidental expenses.  These figures take no account of the normal salary and related costs of Mr. Ryan and his staff or the staffing costs of my Department's company law administration section which is supporting his investigations, as these costs would be covered by my Department's Vote regardless of whether Mr. Ryan's investigations were taking place.  The legal costs of Mr. Ryan's investigations are likewise excluded, as they are borne by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the standardised unemployment rate, or SUR.  First and foremost the measurement of the standardised unemployment rate is a matter for the Central Statistics Office. In brief, it is based on the estimated number of <Col N="599" /> persons unemployed expressed as a percentage of the total economically active population using internationally comparable definitions of employment and unemployment as recommended by the International Labour Office.  Benchmark estimates of the SUR for April of each year are calculated from the labour force survey, with the monthly trend in the seasonally adjusted live register figures used to estimate the monthly SUR between labour force surveys.</P>
      <P>With the introduction last year of the new quarterly national household survey, carried out by the Central Statistics Office, the accuracy of the SUR will be significantly enhanced.</P>
      <P>As to the trend in the SUR itself, in April 1994 the SUR stood at 14.8 per cent.  As of the end of May 1998 this figure had fallen to 9.3 per cent. The SUR has fallen consistently over the past four years and is now below the EU average, an encouraging trend which I welcome sincerely.</P>
      <P>Although the recent trend has been favourable to Irish society as a whole, I am in no doubt that a lot of hard work remains to be done to tackle our structural unemployment problem.  Of course it is the aim of this Government to reduce unemployment further, more specifically, to see the unemployment rate fall to 7 per cent by the end of 2000.  It is a goal clearly outlined in the Employment Action Plan, to be achieved by the strategy outlined in the plan and a goal to which the Government is committed.</P>

      <P>The Government's view is that Ireland's future skills needs must be dealt with in a proactive rather than reactive fashion.  Consequently, the approach to managing the emerging skill needs has been to plan to have the supply of skills available to meet demand and adequate to ensure that overseas investors are attracted to locate high skill operations in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with this approach, the Government established the Business, Education and Training Partnership in November 1997, to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower forecasting and education and training for business.  The key elements of the partnership are the Business Education and Training Partnership Forum which brings together leaders from the worlds of business and education to discuss skills provision and strategies; the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs which is chaired by Dr. Chris Horn of Iona Technologies <Col N="600" /> and which seeks to establish both the needs for and supply of particular skills; and the Skills Implementation Group which is a top level group of officials also chaired by Dr. Horn for the purpose of ensuring that solutions are implemented.</P>
    <P>The expert group has recently completed its first report.  That report states that 8,300 technologists &mdash; professionals and technicians &mdash; will be needed annually from 1997 to 2003, assuming a continuation of the current high rate of growth of demand.  The supply of technologists, combining the existing education and training output, the commitments made last year to increase technologist places and the other sources is estimated at 6,100 per annum, leaving a shortfall of 2,200, based on the high growth scenario.</P>
    <P>There will be additional substantial demand for skilled and semi-skilled operatives in the IT sector. Difficulty is not expected in connection with the supply of operatives.</P>
    <P>The Expert Group has prioritised the interventions which would eliminate the supply deficit for technologists, that are most cost effective and most flexible and rapid.  It has also sought to maximise involvement of private sector companies to ensure that the response is demand led.</P>
    <P>The Skills Implementation Group will be progressing the proposals to implementation.  The Implementation Group has asked a small team to work on the specific costings, schedules and other practical details of these proposals.  This work has already started and is expected to be concluded shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would first take this welcome opportunity to congratulate Ms Caroline Gill on her appointment as the next Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland, with effect from September of this year. The House is aware of Ms Gill's fine record in the area of the protection of Irish consumers' rights.  Her experience and standing in this field, allied to her intuitive understanding of dispute resolution mechanisms and practices, will ensure <Col N="601" /> the continued success of the Insurance Ombudsman's Office in the area of insurance dispute resolution.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the subject of the Office of Insurance Ombudsman on a number of occasions and I have always, as a matter of course, prefaced my remarks by stating that the Ombudsman scheme was set up as a private sector scheme, funded ultimately by the insurance industry itself.  As I indicated to the House, in reply to written questions on this subject on 18 February 1998, the operation of the insurance Ombudsman service, under the auspices of the insurance industry, has proved an outstanding success, as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  That success is due in no small measure to the dedication and expertise of the present Ombudsman, Mrs. Paulyn Marrinan Quinn, who has filled that position since the inception of the scheme in 1992 and who has developed the scope of the service to the mutual benefit of insurance consumers and providers. Clearly, in a case such as this, where self-regulation works so successfully, it would not be appropriate to alter the status of the office, and to place the consequent extra burden of funding a publicly run dispute resolution system on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate that it is our intention to endeavour to maintain and uphold the strict independence of the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman and to this end I recently sought a meeting with its council.  At that meeting with the chairman and deputy chairman, I conveyed concern that the council should be seen to act as an effective buffer, between the board, representing the participating insurance companies and the Ombudsman, to ensure that the Ombudsman had unfettered autonomy in discharging the responsibilities of this very important office, in accordance with the agreed terms of reference.  The council representatives assured me that this was the case.  They, in turn, undertook to reflect on particular matters which I raised with them and I intend to have further discussions with the council in the immediate short-term.  I have the utmost confidence in the ability of both the present and future Ombudsman, to discharge their duties to the highest professional standards, in the interest of the insurance consumers, throughout the country</P>

      <P>I am informed by the IDA that there are no projects in the pipeline at present for the landbanks at Millstreet, Kanturk <Col N="602" /> and Charleville.  However, during 1997, 1,510 new jobs were created by IDA Ireland in the south west region bringing the total employed there in overseas companies to more than 13,699 people.</P>
      <P>The issue of regional distribution continues to be a high priority for IDA Ireland, with companies based in large population centres being encouraged to locate part of their expansion projects in smaller regional locations.  The Deputy can be assured that IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote the south west region including Millstreet, Kanturk and Charleville for overseas mobile investment.</P>

      <P>Chapter 1 of Part VII of the Companies Act, 1990, contains provisions which are designed to tackle the problem, which is generally referred to as the Phoenix Syndrome, where companies are run into liquidation by their owner directors, who having liquidated them, leaving substantial liabilities outstanding to creditors, then proceed to establish new companies, many times operating in the same or a similar line.  By virtue of section 154 of that Act, the provisions also apply to circumstances where a receiver is appointed.</P>
      <P>In brief, the Companies Act, 1990, provides that where it is proved to the court on the commencement of a winding-up, or at any time during the course of a winding-up it is certified by the liquidator or is otherwise proved to the court that the company is unable to pay its debts, the court shall, unless it is satisfied that the directors have acted honestly and responsibly, declare that any person who was a director or shadow director of the company at the date of or within 12 months prior to the commencement of the winding up shall not be involved as a director of or in the promotion or formation of any company unless the company meets specific requirements.  These requirements include, in the case of a public limited company, minimum paid up capital of £100,000 and, in the case of a private company, minimum paid up capital of £20,000.  Other restrictions also apply such as the prohibition on the company granting loans to the directors. Application for relief can be made to the court within one year by a director who is &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;. As previously indicated, the provisions outlined above also apply to receivership situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) <Col N="603" /> examined and made recommendations for changes in six separate areas of company law. Chapter 7 of the CLRG report made recommendations for the reform of the provisions of Part VII.  It recommends, <i>inter alia,</i> a greater focus on disqualification rather than restriction of directors found to have failed to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward proposals to implement those recommendations which I consider appropriate on a phased basis.  In this regard, the preparation of a Bill to implement the CLRG's recommendation in relation to examinership and removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies is in the process of being drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman.  I expect to introduce this Bill to the House later this year.</P>
    <P>As progress is made with this Bill, attention will be given to examination and preparation of the necessary proposals to deal with the other areas.  I have not, however, at this time, decided the order in which I will tackle the CLRG's other recommendations for amendment of company law.</P>

      <P>Having consulted with the Registrar of Friendly Societies on this matter, neither of us is aware, that there has been any take-up among individual credit unions of the enabling provisions contained in section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997.  This allows for the establishment by credit unions of special funds for social, cultural or charitable purposes. If all credit unions in the State affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions were to establish in 1998, the permitted special funds at the maximum levels allowed in sections 44(3) and 44(4), the Registrar has estimated that their initial value would be of the order of £11.25 million.</P>

    <P>Through the publication and circulation last September of an Explanatory Guide to the Credit Union Act, 1997, our Department has made all credit unions aware of the provisions of the new Act.

I pointed out to Commissioner Bonino that the CAI is the only private sector organisation in Ireland wholly involved in consumer protection activities and that it plays an important role in the development and promotion of consumer policy in Ireland.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In Cavan, an advance factory has been constructed on the new IDA site at Cavan town and the facility is being actively marketed to potential overseas investors.  Over the past months, a number of IDA Ireland overseas executives have visited the new Industrial Park at Cavan to meet several of the local companies.  These executives, based in IDA's US and European offices, are actively promoting the Cavan region.  The IDA is encouraged by the positive responses it has received from the companies who have visited the area.</P>
      <P>The issue of regional distribution continues to be a high priority for IDA Ireland, with companies based in large population centres being encouraged to locate part of their expansion projects in smaller regional locations.  The current year should show continuing progress in this respect.</P>
      <P>For 1998, IDA Ireland is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including with higher grant levels, as appropriate; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; and working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment. However, the decision on where to locate rests solely with the overseas investors, based primarily on the competitiveness and general level of attractiveness of individual locations.</P>

      <P>There have been no recent redundancies as a consequence of the merging of agencies to form Enterprise Ireland. Furthermore, my Department has made no attempt to estimate the level of redundancies, if any, which might be necessary as a consequence of the creation of Enterprise Ireland.

      <P>On 23 October 1997, I appointed Mr. Lyndon MacCann, BL, as inspector to Bula Resources (Holdings) plc under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990.  The primary purpose of this investigation is to establish the beneficial ownership of the Bula shares held by Mir Oil Development Limited up to November 1996 and by Chamonix Nominees Limited since then.  The inspector is also mandated to establish the beneficial ownership of shares held in Bula by Pictet International Management Limited prior to February 1997.</P>
      <P>Initially, I had hoped this investigation might be completed within three months, but for various reasons, this has not been possible.  The inspector's investigations have required him to travel abroad on a number of occasions.  He has also had to appear in the High Court several times, either as an applicant or as notice party to related court proceedings, to overcome various difficulties with his inquiry.  At this stage, I understand the inspector's investigation is substantially completed, and I am confident his report should be finalised and submitted to me around the middle of July.  Subject to whatever legal advice I receive on its content, I intend to publish the inspector's report and make a statement on its findings.</P>
      <P>The costs incurred by my Department on this inquiry to date are about £147,000.</P>

      <P>The US Secretary of Commerce, Mr William Daley, led a business development mission to Northern Ireland and the Border counties from 7-11 June 1998.  It was the <Col N="609" /> first business development mission to Ireland since the British-Irish Agreement.  The US business delegation comprised 18 US companies and included representatives of several large US corporations. The visit is concrete evidence of the political and economic commitment of the US to peace and prosperity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department and the promotional agencies prepared a comprehensive programme for the US delegation which allowed them to make a first hand assessment of the advantages of the Border counties from the perspective of trade, investment, technology transfer and business to business partnerships.  The programme, which was situated in Sligo at the request of the US side, emphasised the advantages and strengths of the Border counties and the potential for improved economic growth and development there which arise from the Northern Ireland peace settlement.</P>
      <P>The US delegation had the opportunity to meet a wide range of business and investment interests in the Border counties and more than 30 company to company discussions took place on a range of matters of mutual interest.  I have no doubt that this intensive level of contact will mean we can look forward to strengthened business contacts between US companies and the Border counties in the coming years.  I availed of the meeting with Secretary Daley to restate the Government's appreciation for the roles played by President Clinton and Senator Mitchell in the peace negotiations.  I also emphasised the importance of continued US support as we move now to comprehensive implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in order that the political and economic peace can be made clear to all the people on the island of Ireland.  I am satisfied that the visit has strengthened our contacts with the US side on trade and investment matters and I intend to avail of those contacts to continue to press the case for strengthened US trade and investment in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In the course of my reply to a related question, No. 114 on 23 June 1998, I indicated that the Government has recently established a Task Force to develop a framework, to be operational by end 1999, for an integrated approach to local government and local development, in which enterprise boards already play an important role, and that the proposed establishment of Enterprise Ireland, would not alter the functions of the enterprise boards, other than that there will be more clearly defined arrangements for micro-enterprise project transfers, between the new agency and the existing enterprise boards.</P>

      <P>Apple began a review of its Cork operation last March, following the appointment of Mr. Tim Cook, as new senior vice-president of worldwide operations.  This was followed by indications that Apple planned to relocate its circuit board (PCBA) manufacturing to a location of cheaper labour in the Far East, a move that could result in job losses in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday last, together with the Chief Executive of IDA Ireland, I met with senior management, including Mr. Tim Cook, from Apple Computer in San José to discuss the recent media reports on pending job losses in the company's Cork operation.  At the meeting I emphasised the importance of Apple Cork and expressed the hope that employment at the plant would be maximised with consideration given to locating <Col N="611" /> new activities there.  In the circumstances, my meeting with Apple senior management was positive. I am pleased with asssurances given to me that Apple Cork will continue to be a core strategic part of Apple Computer.</P>
    <P>While a decision regarding the future role of the Cork facility has not yet been finalised, a decision by the company is imminent.  Senior management are due to visit Cork, possibly this week, and meet with staff &mdash; and I expect this will be followed by an announcement on the future of the facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 January 1998, I received a notification of a proposal under the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, whereby Coillte Teoranta intended to acquire a majority of the issued share capital of Balcas Limited, a sawmilling company.  Under section 7 of the Mergers Acts, I can either approve a proposed merger or takeover, or refer a proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation.  Under section 9 of the Mergers Acts, I can then decide whether to permit the proposal, either conditionally or unconditionally or to prohibit it by order.</P>
      <P>I decided to exercise the option of referral to the Competition Authority in this case.  The purpose of referring the proposal to the authority was to establish whether, in its opinion, the acquisition would be likely to prevent or restrict competition, or restrain trade in any goods or services, and would be likely to operate against the common good.  In assessing the likely effect of a proposal on the common good, the authority has regard to a number of criteria.  These criteria are: &mdash; continuity of supplies or services; level of employment; regional development; rationalisation of operations in the interests of greater efficiency; research and development; increased production; access to markets; shareholders and partners; employees and consumers.</P>
      <P>Following its investigation, the Competition Authority reported to me and recommended by a three to one majority that the takeover should be prohibited on competition grounds.  In the interest of fair procedures, the parties to the proposal and interested third parties were circulated with the authority's report in order to give them the opportunity to comment on it.  I also consulted the Ministers for the Marine and Natural Resources and Finance for their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I considered the authority's report in light of these comments and views and having regard to all the comments I received and indeed <Col N="612" /> all the circumstances of the proposal, I decided to prohibit the takeover in the interest of the common good.  To give effect to my decision, I have made an order under section 9 of the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, which I have laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have also placed copies of the report of the Competition Authority in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

This is achieved through active participation and representation on many European Union and OECD policy committees, discussion groups, and other labour market policy fora.  Through such participation my Department has an opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise with policy makers from around the globe and to keep abreast of developments in this area.</P>
      <P>Recent Swedish active labour market policy is summarised in the Swedish employment action plan of April 1998, of which my Department has a copy.  Officials from my Department will have further opportunities to participate in discussions with European counterparts concerning the employment action plans at forthcoming meetings in Brussels on the implementation of the action plans, which will take place in the period ahead.  The exchange of views with the Commission, and with other member states will help inform the ongoing development of our own labour market policies, having regard of course to the macroeconomic conditions applying here.</P>
      <P>I do not consider a fact finding mission to Sweden to study their recent active labour market policies is necessitated.</P>

      <Quest>her views on a recent report from the Industrial Research and Development Group that research and development by Irish industry and State agencies is significantly overestimated and, in reality, countries including Denmark and the Netherlands spend twice as much per capita as Ireland on industrial research.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to state that there is consensus <Col N="613" /> at national and international levels that Research and Development (R&amp;D) is of critical importance to competitiveness, employment and the enhancement of society.</P>
      <P>Recent reports from the European Commission, the OECD and our own White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation, all highlight the importance of research and development, in a globalised economy.  I therefore welcome the Industry Research and Development Group report, which concurs with this approach and provides a useful contribution to the ongoing debate, on the need for industry to perform R&amp;D.</P>
      <P>I feel it is important however, to clarify that there is no over-estimation of the level of R&amp;D performed by Irish industry or in any other part of the economy.  Statistics on R&amp;D in Ireland are produced for our Department by Forfás, according to long established guidelines, which operate in countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands and all other OECD countries.  The IRDG Report provides one interpretation of these figures.</P>
      <P>Data collected by Forfás, using the most widely-used basis for making international comparisons of industrial R&amp;D activity namely expenditure by industry on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP, shows that for Ireland, such expenditure has risen from just below 0.5 per cent in 1986, to just over 1 per cent in 1995, which is equivalent to an investment of around £400 million.  This represents a high rate of growth compared to other OECD countries and places Ireland on a par with countries such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada.  We are however, still behind the levels found in countries such as Japan, USA and Sweden, where expenditure on R&amp;D equates to 2 per cent or more, of GDP.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to increase the level of R&amp;D expenditure in Irish industry, particularly first time R&amp;D performers, this Government secured additional funding for research technology and innovation of 39 Mecu &mdash; £29 million approximately &mdash; as part of the mid term review of Structural Funds carried out last year. EU Structural Funding of £104 million for InCompany R&amp;D, had already been provided under the highly successful Measure 1 Scheme, but all of this had been committed by July of last year.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, I re-launched the research technology and innovation (RTI) scheme, last November, following agreement between the European Commission, our Department, Forbairt/Enterprise Ireland and the Industry Research and Development Group, representing IBEC.  Funding under the scheme is allocated by means of fixed monthly tranches, which will end in 1999.  Decisions in relation to individual projects are made by an independent committee &mdash; known as the RTI/Measure 1 Committee, which is representative of industry, academia, the industrial agencies and our Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> I am satisfied that these arrangements will ensure a continued commitment to innovative R&amp;D by Irish industry, particularly SMEs leading ultimately to new products and processes.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Government is committed to supporting an anti-piracy campaign as proposed by the business software alliance in Ireland which would have the objective of reducing the Irish software theft and piracy rate recently estimated at 70 per cent of packaged business software used and, accordingly, of increasing employment in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very concerned at the level of software piracy in Ireland.  Software pirates not only undermine the livelihoods of authors and economic entities, but they also inhibit investment in new products.  The Government is firmly committed to defeating piracy in the computer software industry and, indeed, in other sectors covered by copyright law.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department has recently brought forward the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, formerly the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which is currently before the Oireachtas.  This Bill contains stringent new penalties for copyright offences.  My Department is also currently drafting a Copyright and Related Rights Bill, which will effect a comprehensive reform of Irish copyright legislation and provide a modern, effective and efficient environment of legal protection for all copyright interests.  The programme of copyright reform currently in hands will provide a strong disincentive to software pirates and would-be pirates.</P>
      <P>Any initiative which helps to decrease the level of piracy in Ireland is to be welcomed.  Accordingly, I welcome the present initiative by the Business Software Alliance in particular, as a contribution to the educational battle to counter the use of copyright infringing software material. Education is critical in the fight against copyright piracy, and I fully endorse all efforts to highlight the importance of copyright compliance in the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>1.  The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which was reconstituted in October, 1997, is serviced by the Institute of Public Administration.  The Committee hope to publish a report on the Institutions of the State in November, 1998, which will cover the Presidency, Dáil, Seanad, Attorney General, Government, courts, international relations, and the conduct of referenda.  Specific consideration is also being given to the ways in which people living in Northern Ireland might play a more active part in national political life, to the extent that they so desire and in a spirit consistent with the principles underlying the peace settlement.</P>
      <P>The Committee has been asked to examine how human rights might be further protected and strengthened in this jurisdiction in the context of the Multi-Party Agreement.  The Committee will examine this topic following the publication of the report on the Institutions of the State and upon receipt of detailed proposals from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Estimate for the Committee for 1998 in £240,000.</P>
      <P>2.  The Dublin Taxi Forum was established last December at the Taoiseach's suggestion.  The forum is chaired by John Mahony, Chairman of the Dublin Transportation Office, and the secretariat is provided by Dublin Corporation.  No direct costs arise for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>3.  The Government has agreed to the establishment of a Government Millennium Steering Group which will be chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Séamus Brennan).  To date no costs have arisen from this decision.</P>
      <P>4.  The High-Level Group on Trade Union Recognition was established in August 1997.  It is envisaged that the group will compile an agreed report which will be subsequently published at a date yet to be determined.  No costs arise from the establishment of this group and the issue of the costs involved in the future publication of its report will be determined closer to the publication date.</P>
      <P>5.  The Interdepartmental Implementation Group for the Information Society was established in February 1998.  The group will publish a report when its programme of work is completed. A publication date will be set nearer the time.  No costs arise from the establishment of this group and the issue of the costs involved in the future publication of its report will be determined closer to the publication date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.  The Working Group on Basic Income, comprising the Social Partners and relevant Government Departments was established in July 1997. <Col N="629" /> The working group has drawn up a Terms of Reference for a Study on Basic Income which will look at the viability of introducing a basic income system in Ireland.  This study is taking place in two phases.  Phase I, which examines the costs and distributional analysis of a basic income is currently under way and an interim report is due in August 1998.  Phase II, which is out to tender at present, will consider the dynamic effects of such a system from a broad economic and social perspective and will draw on the findings of Phase I. It is expected that the tender for Phase II will be awarded in August.  The overall study is due to be completed by the end of the year and overall budget for both phases of the basic income study is £115,000.</P>

      <Quest>the ethical criteria or principles, if any, that attach to the State's capital investment policy such as offering capital assistance to multinational corporations proposing to establish manufacturing or service providing operations in Ireland through agencies like IDA Ireland; the measures, if any, under consideration to develop policy in this area, particularly in view of recent reports detailing the extent of Ireland's contribution to the world wide armaments industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Foreign direct investment has made a significant contribution to the development and modernisation of the Irish economy and much of our recent high growth has been driven by exports from the foreign-owned sector.  Foreign-owned firms have had a positive impact on the development of indigenous companies through the purchase of goods and services.  They have also had a role in the upgrading of Ireland's infrastructure and skills base.  In manufacturing and internationally traded services more people are now employed by overseas-owned companies than in Irish companies.  I wish to assure the Deputy that proposals to establish enterprises based on the production of armaments in Ireland will not be considered by the IDA, regardless of economic benefits.  There are no proposals to change this policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is in place to ensure the transparency of drink prices sold in public houses.  The Retail Prices (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1976, obliges licensed premises to display a list of the price(s) of all beverages sold on the premises.  The regulations are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who regularly takes prosecutions for non-display of price lists.</P>
      <P>As regards the prices charged, it is Government policy to encourage competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers.  As the Deputy will be aware, prices in this area are not controlled by regulation &mdash; the price levels are determined by the market.  However, competition in the market is governed by the rules of competition as set out in the Competition Acts.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices, including price fixing and the abuse of a dominant position.  Under the Act, any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief, by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
      <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, contains offences and penalty provisions for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act.  In addition, it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition.  A Director of Competition Enforcement has been appointed to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
      <P>As a result of the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, there are now two alternative ways of pursuing allegations of breaches of competition rules.  If the Deputy has any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, he could take a civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or lodge a complaint with the Director of Competition Enforceemnt requesting him to investigate the alleged breach(s).  The Director of Competition Enforcement is based at the offices of the Competition Authority, Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, makes provision for the preparation and submission to the Minister, of draft codes of practice by the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister may declare the draft code to be a code of practice for the purposes of the Act.  This was done for the Code of Practice on Dispute Procedure, including Procedures in Essential Services, which was promulgated <Col N="631" /> by Order, as Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 1992 on 6 January, 1992.  Adoption of the code in individual employments is primarily a matter for negotiation and agreement between employers and trade unions.</P>
      <P>The Advisory Service of the Labour Relations Commission continues to monitor observance of the code by employers and trade unions, as well as providing guidance and advice on its implementation. Indeed, the number of days lost due to industrial dispute continued to decline to 74,508 in 1997.  Accordingly, I would recommend that industrial negotiating parties take account of the provisions of the code of practice, with a view to sustaining this welcome trend and as a means of improving the stability of the employment relationship.</P>

      <P>My Department has received numerous representations on this issue over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Re-adaptation Aid Funding, under Article 56.2 (b) of the ECSC Treaty, was secured by my Department from the European Commission and paid, in April 1997, to 209 former Irish Steel Ltd. workers who were made redundant as a result of the 1994 restructuring plan.  The application for such funding had been made by my Department on the basis that the extra-statutory redundancy payments, made in respect of these workers, constituted the State matching funds.  This was accepted by the Commission and corresponded to <Col N="632" /> the situation in 1985-86 when former Irish Steel Limited.  workers had also received similar funding, during a previous company restructuring.</P>
    <P>There are no payments outstanding to the former workers, either from the European Commission or from the Government.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the organisation mentioned by the Deputy, but would welcome any information which he has about it.</P>
      <P>There is no separate category of consumer co-operatives, under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893-1978, under which co-operatives are registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The only means of identifying them is if the term consumer co-operative is included in their title.  The Registrar tells me that at present there is no active society registered as a consumer co-operative.</P>
      <P>Last January, our Department invited submissions from a wide range of interests on the question of amending these Acts.  As I plan to bring legislative proposals to Government in the coming months, I would welcome any ideas which the Deputy may wish to contribute to our deliberations in this general area.</P>

      <P>Irish Fertilizer Industries (IFI) was set up in 1987 as a joint venture company with the State, through NET, owning 51 per cent and the remaining 49 per cent owned by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). Following recent re-organisation, ICI no longer has any remaining interests in fertilisers manufacture, apart from its IFI shareholding, and the company has, accordingly, indicated a willingness to dispose of this shareholding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent months, I have met with the board <Col N="640" /> of IFI, and with representatives of the IFI group of unions.  I have also had a discussion with the chairman of ICI and preliminary discussions have taken place between Departmental officials and ICI executives, with a view to agreeing a mutually acceptable approach in relation to IFI.  I intend bringing proposals to Government in the coming weeks regarding the future of IFI.  The State guaranteed NET debt is currently £166.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The £2,000 figure mentioned by the Deputy refers to, I assume, the annual grant paid to PhD students under the graduate support scheme, which is overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board.  This scheme funds approximately 160 new PhD students per annum for three years.  This level of funding is a contribution to the cost involved.  The terms and conditions of this scheme do not include a restriction on total student earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that this is but one source of funding available to PhD students.  Postgraduates are also funded under other schemes overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board and by other State funded schemes.  As part of the £5 million research support package which I announced on 26 May 1998, £0.5 million has been allocated for studentships in science and technology, involving direct support for doctoral <Col N="641" /> and post-doctoral students.  I have not seen any evidence to suggest that the level of State funding available across the range of State supported measures is a disincentive to students to carry out postgraduate research in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The level and type of support available in different European countries is varied and complex as each reflects local conditions.  Consequently, comparisons are difficult.  I understand that in countries such as the UK and USA it is now common for postgraduate students to take out special loans to support them, as they undertake their postgraduate degrees.  The loans are then repaid when they begin work.</P>

      <P>An application for a work permit was received by my Department <Col N="642" /> from an organisation on behalf of the person concerned on 11 February 1998.  The application was refused on the basis that no evidence was put forward by the organisation of any reasonable effort to recruit an EU/EEA national for the job such as advertisements placed in the national newspapers.  The organisation was so notified on 20 April 1998.</P>
      <P>However, in the circumstances of this particular case, I have asked for the matter to be reviewed.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy on completion of that review.</P>

The order also requires that all other forms of advertising must state the admission price together with a reference to the fact that an additional charge may be payable in certain circumstances.

Mr. Fagan's paper, Measuring the Size of Ireland's Black Economy, presented the results of applying a range of techniques for estimating the size of the black economy in Ireland. The paper concluded that, while the available evidence indicated the existence of a significant black economy, all of the techniques available for estimating the magnitude of the black economy suffer from significant limitations and, consequently, no definitive conclusions could be drawn.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, which came into operation on 2 January 1997, in place of the previous 1977 Act, sets down the rules for the employment of children, that is, persons under the age of 16 or the school leaving age, whichever is higher, and young persons, that is, 16 and 17 year olds.  The permitted working hours for children and young persons is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Children (Aged 14 and 15)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers may not employ those under 16 in a regular full time job.  Children of 14 and 15 years of age may undertake light, non-industrial work outside of the school term, subject to a period of three weeks being left free from work during the summer holidays, up to a maximum of seven hours per day of 35 hours per week.  Children <Col N="644" /> aged 15 may be employed to do a maximum of eight hours light, non-industrial, work per week during the school term.  Night work for children is prohibited between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. on the next day.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Young persons (aged 16 and 17)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Young persons may work a maximum of eight hours per day or 40 hours per week.  Night work for young persons is prohibited between 10 p.m. on any one day and 6 a.m. on the following day. This prohibition may be altered to the period between 11 p.m. on any one day, provided the day is not before a school day during a school term where the young person is attending school, and 7 a.m. on the following day, where the Minister is satisfied, following consultation with such representatives of employers and representatives of employees as the Minister considers appropriate, that there are exceptional circumstances affecting a particular branch of activity or a particular area of work as may be prescribed, that is, by regulation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment on work experience or training programmes.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Persons aged 15 may be employed as part of an approved, by FÁS or the Minister, training programme, and an employer may employ a 14 or 15 year old who is a full-time second level student as part of a work experience or educational programme. These placements are for a maximum eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment of children in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising activities</i>
    </P>
    <P>Children, that is, under 16 years olds, may be employed in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising work which is not harmful to the safety, health or development of the child and does not interfere with the child's attendance at school, where permission by licence has been received from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The licence sets out conditions about parental consent, supervision and education arrangements and the maximum working times and minimum breaks appropriate to different age groups.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-compliance</i>
    </P>
    <P>In regard to non-compliance, my Department investigates all complaints under the Act and we have no evidence of any pupils being encouraged to leave school early for work.  During 1997, 37 complaints were received under the Act.  A total of 35 cases were resolved satisfactorily during that year and one case was referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings.  Legal advice in this case is awaited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the basic research grants scheme which is funded under Measure 4 of the Research and development sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industry and which is overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board.</P>
      <P>I understand that at its meeting last week, the National Research Support Fund Board approved 91 new projects, with a total value of £4 million.  This year's financial commitments for these projects will be met through the Higher Education Authority, £0.5 million, and through a reallocation within the budget of the office of science and technology, £0.5 million.</P>
      <P>I assume that the newly established science and technology groups referred to by the Deputy, relates to the working group which I announced recently.  This working group will have representation from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science, and from Forbairt-Enterprise Ireland and the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the terms of reference for the working group.  I have already announced that the remit of the working group will include examining the future funding arrangements for basic research, which includes arrangements for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter departmental committee on science and technology, which I chair, has a broader role than that of the working group.  It has representatives from all 12 science and technology spending <Col N="646" /> Departments.  Its function is to advise the Government on national science and technology investment priorities, a task which is carried out as part of the annual estimates and budget cycle. The targeted membership of the working group will allow for a more detailed examination of future funding arrangements for basic research than would be possible under the inter departmental committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>The job initiative is a pilot programme introduced in October 1996 providing full-time work, for three years, for those who are 35 years or over and five years or more unemployed and whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  There are currently just under 1,000 persons on the programme.</P>
      <P>The programme is operated by managing agents under the auspices of the relevant local area partnerships.  Managing agents are paid a grant of £210 per week by FÁS in respect of each job created under the job initiative.  However this grant should not be seen as the wages of job initiative particpants but rather as a contribution towards costs.  It is a matter for managing agents to supplement this grant, if they consider it necessary, through other funds they receive from the State or otherwise.  The actual wages paid to a job initiative employee, including specific terms and conditions of employment, would be a matter for negotiation between the employee in question and the managing agent and is not a matter in which I have a function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the programme is to provide full-time work for those in disadvantaged areas who have faced major difficulties in assimilating <Col N="647" /> into the open labour market.  The objective ultimately would be to see as many as possible of them making that reintegration.</P>
    <P>I intend having an evaluation carried out on the job initiative shortly and any decision regarding its future will not be taken until I am in receipt of, and have had time to consider, the evaluation's findings.</P>
    <P>As the job initiative is designed to provide full-time work, paying the going rate for the job, job initiative employees, like other employees in mainstream employment, can qualify for family income supplement, FIS, instead of secondary social welfare benefits such as the differential rent scheme.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the matter to which the Deputy refers is under active consideration jointly by NSAI and the Office of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>In March 1998, the EU Commission confirmed a contract with CEN, the European Standards Committee, for a study of the practicality of introducing standards for flammability aspects of nightwear throughout the EU.  The development of such a European standard would replace the Irish standard &mdash; IS 148.</P>
      <P>The existence of this CEN project makes further development of the Irish standard difficult due to a standstill agreement, whereby the member countries of CEN have agreed not to proceed with the development of national standards in parallel.</P>
      <P>However, within the context of this project in the CEN Technical Committee TC 248 &mdash; Textile and Textile Products, NSAI proposes to have the broader issue of general clothing flammability addressed.  NSAI has already had discussions with the National Safety Council in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Office of Consumer Affairs has addressed the matter through its partner bodies in the other EU member states and is currently awaiting information which may support the introduction of more restricted flammability requirements on clothing.</P>

      <P>Directive 96/74/EC on Textile Names is a consolidating directive, which did not introduce any substantial new provisions or amendments.  The Attorney General's office was consulted.  Given that the four directives which Directive 96/74/EC consolidated and repealed had already been incorporated into Irish domestic legislation, by virtue of the European Communities (Names and Labelling of Textile Products) Regulations, 1973, as amended, no further legislative changes were deemed necessary.</P>

    <P>Directive 97/4/EC amends the principal Food Labelling Directive (79/112/EEC).

The directive is complex and the Commission and representatives of the member states are currently in the process of drawing up informal guidelines for the implementation of certain of the principles contained in the directive.  Work on the implementation of the directive is under way in parallel with the preparation of the draft guidelines.</P>
    <P>Directive 97/7/EC on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts is due for transposition into national law by June 2000. Because of the wide scope of the directive and the complexity of its application, it will be necessary to undertake a thorough consultation process with interested parties.  It is anticipated that this process will begin later this year and I am confident that the necessary legislation will be in place by the required date.</P>

      <P>The Trade Marks Act, 1996, made legislative provision for the ratification of the Madrid Protocol. Ratification will require significant changes in the Trade Mark Rules, 1996.  Work on these changes, which involves significant technical and legal considerations, has been delayed in view of the priority necessarily afforded by the intellectual property unit of my Department to the long overdue reform of copyright legislation.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the desirability of ratifying the Protocol at the earliest possible date.  Work to this end is the top priority of the intellectual property unit of my Department in the field of trade marks.  It is now anticipated that it should be possible to ratify the Madrid Protocol in the early part of 1999.</P>
      <P>A programme of copyright reform currently in hands will provide a strong disincentive to software pirates and would-be pirates.</P>
      <P>Any initiatve which helps to decrease the level of piracy in Ireland is to be welcomed.  Accordingly, I welcome the present initiative by the Business Software Alliance, in particular, as a contribution to the educational battle to counter the use of copyright infringing software material. Education is critical in the fight against copyright piracy and I fully endorse all efforts to highlight the importance of copyright compliance in the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>Training for unemployed people is primarily provided by FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, which is under the aegis of my Department. At the end of May, FÁS was providing training for 11,643 unemployed people.  There is a 70 per cent placement rate for FÁS skills training courses.</P>
      <P>The categories of training provided by FÁS are the following:</P>
      <P>Foundation Training:- This encompasses pre-vocational or preparatory training, including the Youthreach programme.  It aims to enable people to progress to higher levels of training and is mainly availed of by early school leavers, long-term unemployed people and women returning to the workforce.  There are currently 4,532 unemployed people on such courses.</P>
      <P>Specific Skills Training:- This is related to employment opportunities in the labour market. There are currently 3,108 unemployed people on such courses.</P>
      <P>Traineeship:- This is a relatively new initiative aimed at providing a structured training input for new entrants to the labour market. Training takes place both on the job and FÁS training centres.  There are currently 701 unemployed people on such courses.</P>
      <P>Job Training Scheme:- This is predominantly aimed at new labour market entrants and all training takes place in employers' premises. It is envisaged that this programme will eventually be subsumed into the new traineeship initiative.  There are currently 944 unemployed people on such courses.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are currently 2,358 apprentices in training with FÁS.</P>
      <P>Training for unemployed people is also provided by CERT, for the hotel and catering industry, and by Teagasc, for the agricultural sector. These bodies are under the aegis of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Agriculture and Food, respectively. In addition, the Department of Education and Science also provides education opportunities for unemployed people who wish to return to education to improve their chances of securing employment.</P>

      <P>All training programmes in FÁS are open, on an equal basis, to men and women.  There are currently 4,920 women participating on FÁS training programmmes, out of a total of 11,643 participants. There is always a degree of roll-over of places as current courses come to an end and new courses commence.</P>
      <P>Since 1990 FÁS has had in place an annual Action Programme for Women &mdash; Women in Focus.  This programme has as its objectives the active promotion of: the breaking down of traditional patterns of occupational segration by encouraging increased female participation in sectors of the labour market traditionally dominated by men; the participation of women at all levels in growing, future oriented sectors of the labour market including technical and managerial occupations and the upgrading of existing skills levels among women.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in the continuing growth in women's participation on FÁS programmes.</P>
      <P>Over the three year period 1998 to 2000, FÁS will develop, implement and report on its activities for women with an increased focus on monitoring. Performance indicators will be developed to ensure that the participation rates of women throughout the full range of FÁS programmes are maintained.  FÁS will seek to ensure that its services reach women in key groups such as the long-term unemployed, returners, those with disabilities, travellers and early school leavers.</P>

      <P>By trade missions or equivalent I assume that the Deputy is referring to the overseas offices of the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department.  The decision as to where to locate an overseas office is a day to day matter and is one in which I do not have a direct function.  An Bord Tráchtála has informed me that its overseas offices are situated in the following locations: EU member countries; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK and non-EU countries: Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, People's Republic of China, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Shanghai, Singapore, USA.  IDA Ireland has informed me that it has overseas offices in the following locations: EU member countries: France, Germany, Netherlands, UK and non-EU countries: Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, USA.  Shannon Development has overseas offices in the USA to attract inward investment into the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is the Department's agency with responsibility for the development of indigenous industry in Ireland.  As such, Forbairt does not maintain an extensive overseas presence. However, it maintains a limited overseas involvement both in the context of its technology transfer-partnership programme and in the context of its role in attracting overseas investment in the natural resources sectors.  Forbairt's overseas offices are located in Germany, Japan and USA.</P>
      <P>The promotion of trade and investment in conjunction with the trade and industry development agencies is a major obligation of Ireland's overseas diplomatic mission.</P>

      <P>I understand that the project to develop the angling product at Inniscarra includes the charging of fees for angling.  Revenue generation by fishery owners is an option available to them for consideration in the context of <Col N="656" /> investment to develop and enhance angling facilities and the fishery itself.</P>
      <P>The marketing of Ireland as a prime angling destination for game, sea or coarse fishing will be built on the quality, variety and accessibility of fisheries and associated tourism infrastructure. Experience in this country and elsewhere is that tourism anglers generally will have no difficulty in paying a charge, where appropriate, for access to a superior angling product.</P>

      <P>Hawk Cliff is not among the priority coast protection proposals submitted to my Department by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for consideration under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999.  In these circumstances, and given the extremely limited resources available for coast protection under the present operational programme, I regret that it would not be possible, in the short term, to provide grant aid for such a project to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council should this be sought.  However, in the context of developing priorities for coastal protection work, the county council will be asked for an assessment of the situation at Hawk Cliff and where it should rank in terms of priority.</P>

The projects include, instream development work, sea angling signposting and provision of angling pools.</P>
      <P>The programme runs until the end of 1999, which means there are still opportunities for further projects to be put forward.  I am particularly keen to see community groups and local enterprise working together with fisheries groups to develop tourism angling projects on the ground.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to a European Commission Report, No 2080/92, which has categorised Irish forestry policy as being one of the least environmentally conscious of those surveyed, giving insufficient weighting to environmental objectives and which has faulted Ireland as the country that availed of environmentally damaging exotic species, for example Sitka spruce, at a rate totally out of line with all other EU countries; and if, in view of that finding, he has considered reversing the mix of 80 per cent conifer to 20 per cent broadleaf which currently informs the national forestry strategy and the operational programme of Coillte Teoranta; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137, 138 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the article referred to by the Deputy.  This is a synopsis of a research project, Irish Forestry Policy: A Cost Benefit Analysis, which has yet to be published.  The forest service has many reservations and concerns in relation to the structure, parameters and assumptions used in the study and will be commenting in due course when the study is published.  I cannot agree with the Deputy's summary of the report's conclusions.  The study actually finds &ldquo;that the Strategic Plan passes a cost benefit test when its discount rate is 5 per cent or less.  This suggests that the programme is socially efficient&rdquo;.  The article does not contain any matter which has not already been addressed, at greater depth, in Growing for the Future, the Government approved strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the plan points out, the estimated real rate of return on investment in forestry is 5 per cent including land costs and exclusive of grants and subsidies.  It also indicates that a comparison of results for forestry and agriculture was made both including and excluding the current subsidies to forestry and agriculture.  Excluding subsidies, forestry clearly gives a higher return than agricultural activities apart from dairying.</P>
      <P>I have no proposal to alter, amend or modify the mandate of Coillte Teoranta as a result of the article referred to.  While I accept that Ireland's broadleaf cover is relatively low in comparison with other EU member states the strategic plan referred to above clearly sets out the objective of increased diversification of species in Irish forestry today and the planting of broadleaves is critical to the successful implementation of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the current grant and premium <Col N="667" /> schemes include a new category called 20 per cent diverse which will result in all sites to be planted having at least 20 per cent of a second species; the elimination of the existing non-diverse category which effectively ends the practices of monoculture or single species planting sites; a supplement to the loss of income premium payable to farmers who plant a better quality land.  Moving a better quality land will improve the opportunities for the planting of more diverse conifer species and broadleaves; an emphasis on the traditional Irish continental model of broadleaf planting which entails a higher diversity of plants per hectare in order to improve timber quality.  The grant levels have been adjusted to reflect the higher costs which the modification entails.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the voluntary organisation referred to by the Deputy and my Department has grant aided a range of projects promoting the concept of broadleaf planting undertaken by that organisation.  In addition, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Byrne, recently launched a new publication, &ldquo;Growing Broadleaves&rdquo;, on the growing and management of broadleaf plantations, published by COFORD which is funded by my Department.  This is, in fact, the first book published in Ireland that provides landowners, foresters, and the general public with comprehensive silvicultural guidelines for the main broadleaf species.</P>
    <P>The European Commission report referred to by the Deputy under the reference 2080/92 is, in fact, a mid-term review of the application of the accompanying measure for forestry (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2080/92) in the member states.</P>
    <P>The report presents a factual description of the application of the measure and is not in any way critical of Ireland or any other member state.</P>
    <P>The afforestation programme is funded under the accompanying measures for CAP, namely, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2080/92 of June 1992 which instituted a Community aid scheme for forestry measures in agriculture.  This aid is part-financed, 75 per cent, by the guarantee section of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund, EAGGF, to promote afforestation as an alternative use of agricultural land and the development of forestry activities on farms in order to accompany the changes to be introduced under the market organisation rules; contribute towards an eventual improvement in forestry resources; contribute towards forms of countryside management more compatible with environmental balance; combat the greenhouse effect and absorb carbon-dioxide.</P>
    <P>The aid scheme comprises aid for afforestation costs, a premium to cover maintenance of afforested areas, a premium to cover losses of income resulting from afforestation of agriculture land.  Under the afforestation programme, a fundamental condition of grant-aid is that forestry development is compatible with the protection of the environment and there <Col N="668" /> are a wide range of controls in place to ensure this takes place.  All projects must be submitted for grant approval before work begins so that environmental factors can be taken into account.  Where environmental considerations are identified other State agencies and local authorities are consulted in relation to national heritage areas, areas of landscape or amenity interests, areas of fisheries interest and areas of archaeological interest.  Published guidelines on the landscape, fisheries and archaeology must be implemented by grant-aided forestry and grant-aid is not available for planting within at least 60 metres of a building unless the owner agrees, in which cases the minimum distance is 30 metres, or within 20 metres of a public road for conifers or ten metres for broadleaves.  Grants are not available for areas which are protected or qualify for protection under the EU birds directive or habitats directive. Applications for grant assistance have been refused and proposed projects adjusted on environmental grounds.</P>
    <P>Sitka spruce grows particularly well in Ireland, in relation to both its suitability for soils and sites and its early economic return, and will therefore continue to be the basis of the afforestation programme. In terms of the environment, conifers remove more carbon from the atmosphere than broadleaves and are, therefore, more efficient in combating the greenhouse effect.  However I recognise the value of species diversification in relation to providing a variety of end-use options, protecting forest health, enhancing landscape, providing recreation and leisure opportunities and improving wildlife and habitat diversity.  As referred to above, I have therefore introduced a requirement that all conifer sites must have at least 20 per cent of conifer species other than Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and a requirement to plant a 10 per cent broadleaf content on diverse conifer plantations, site permitting.  The national target, as set out in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector, is to reduce Sitka spruce planting to 60 per cent of total afforestation.</P>
    <P>Funding for post-1999 afforestation is being dealt with in the new rural development regulation of Agenda 2000.  Discussions in relation to this have commenced and, in this context, the forestry strategy, in common with all national development strategies will be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the extensive use of native birch in Finland.  There are two species of birch indigenous to Ireland and common to northern Europe.  Unfortunately, the timber of both species has very limited commercial value in Ireland because of the small size and poor form associated with these species.  In Scandinavia, birch of the same species attain substantially greater size and much better form and, as a result, the wood has furniture and industrial potential.  Trials with seed of Scandinavian origin have been laid down on several occasions in Ireland but the results have been unsatisfactory due to provenance differences within species.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that birch species are grant aided under the forestry planting programmes when used as a constituent of a mixed species plantation. Being a pioneer species, it has a valuable silvicultural role as a nurse species in the establishment of both conifer and broadleaf plantation. It is also used and grant aided in forest establishment for landscape and amenity purposes. However, because of its small size and poor form relative to other species, it has very limited potential as a timber resource in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Other areas such as national heritage areas, NHAs, archaeological sites or monuments are considered on their merits but are refused grant aid where the development would be incompatible with their protection.</P>

      <P>The regional fisheries boards involve themselves closely and on an ongoing basis with the local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency in the planning and environmental licensing process where applications have potential impact on fisheries and fish habitats.  There is no reluctance on the part of the fisheries boards to actively pursue their statutory concerns in that process.</P>
      <P>The application to which the Deputy refers was made to the Environmental Protection Agency for an effluent discharge licence.  The EPA statutorily consults a number of agencies, including the relevant regional fisheries boards on all such applications.  In this particular case, I am advised that the regional fisheries board concerned, tabled a series of recommendations on various aspects of the application which the EPA took into account in reaching its decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 and 23 July 1998 I will be attending the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, which will take place in conjunction with the annual meeting of the OSPAR Commission.  The ministerial meeting will be the first such meeting under the OSPAR Convention since it entered into force on 23 February 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with my ministerial colleagues I will be working for the adoption of: a new annex to the convention on the protection and conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area; strategies to guide the future work of the OSCAR Commission with regard to: hazardous substances; radioactive substances; eutrophication; the protection and conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area; an action plan setting out the actions and activities to be carried out by the <Col N="672" /> Commission over the next five years; an OSPAR decision on the disposal of disused offshore installations; OSPAR decisions and recommendations aimed at the reduction of pollution from a number of industrial sectors including the PVC sector of the organic chemical industry, the primary non-ferrous metal industry; and the aluminium electrolysis sector; and draft guidelines for the management of dredged material and for the dumping of fish waste from land based industrial fish processing operations.  At the end of our meeting we will adopt a ministerial declaration, giving political impetus to future action by the OSPAR Commission in support of good quality marine environment for the Northeast Atlantic.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disposal of disused offshore installations, I am committed to an OSCAR decision that is governed by the precautionary principle, which takes account of potential effects on the environment.  It must recognise that reuse, recycling or final disposal on land will generally be the preferred option for the decommissioning of offshore installations.  In order to be successful the decision, which will be legally binding for the contracting parties who adopt it, must command the unanimous support of all contracting parties to the convention.</P>
    <P>As to the question of radioactive discharges into the marine environment, the Irish Government will be seeking the phasing out of such discharges at the meeting of the OSPAR Commission. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, will attend the ministerial meeting to deal with radiological protection issues which are his specific responsibility.</P>
    <P>Ireland, supported by Denmark, Norway and Iceland, has been to the forefront of discussions in the OSPAR working groups relating to the formulation of an OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances, and these will be considered at the OSCAR Commission and ministerial meeting.  Indeed, Ireland, supported by these countries, has tabled a number of amendments to the draft strategy aimed at strengthening the text with a view to moving towards the target of cessation of radioactive discharges by the year 2020.  I should add that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will also focus on technetium 99 discharges into the Irish Sea.  He will call for these discharges to be reduced to pre-1994 levels with the ultimate aim of having them eliminated.</P>

      <P>While the initial report on the razor clam fishery has been prepared for Bord Iascaigh Mhara, further research on a range of issues, including the quality and location of stocks, is necessary. My Department is working in co-operation with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute to put in place research strategies and measures which will facilitate the conservation and sustainable utilisation of razor clam resources.</P>

      <P>The multisectoral strategic approach to tackling water quality problems in Lough Leane and the Killarney lakes generally is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with my full support and closely involves the South Western Regional Fisheries Board to ensure that the fisheries perspective is taken into account.  The manager of the South Western Regional Fisheries Board is a member of the Lough Leane Working Group and has advised that comprehensive sampling of the water quality is continuing.  Analysis is not yet complete and it would be premature to draw any conclusions.</P>
      <P>I have consistently stressed that education and awareness are vital to pollution prevention and in this regard a programme of farm visits and surveys is being undertaken by Kerry County Council and the South Western Regional Fisheries Board.  In addition a phosphate usage awareness week was organised in the area earlier this year and was very well received.  Consultants have been appointed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to comprehensively analysis and report on the particular water quality problems associated with the catchment and they are expected to report next year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is public concern, particularly at local community level, concerning the proposed siting of a Loran C mast at Loop Head, County Clare.  I have already announced that there will be a comprehensive public consultation process in addition to the statutory planning process to which the project has already been submitted.  The proposed consultation process will allow all interested parties, including those with concerns, to put their views forward and to have them considered.  I also intend to visit the proposed site of the mast and speak directly with local people about the format of the consultation procedure which I have proposed will consist of two open days:- one to be held in Clare and to deal with the local impact of the proposed mast, having regard to visual, environmental and other concerns expressed regarding the sitting of the mast at Loop Head; a second to be held in Dublin and to deal with the generalities of the Loran C proposal, having regard to particular to the future of radio navigation in North West Europe and globally and <Col N="675" /> the position of the Loran C system within the plans for radio navigation structures internationally. This process is designed to clarify all the issues involved.</P>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in the North West European Loran C radio navigation system arises out of the international agreement approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992.  As well as France, our partners in the agreement are the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Germany.  Intensive discussions were held by all the parties in the lead up to the international agreement to establish a civil North West European Loran C system. These discussions ranged across technical, financial and management matters.  Ongoing contacts take place between the partners to deal with the practical implementation of the agreement.  Our partners have been advised of my intention to hold a consultation process on the Loran C issue.</P>

    <P>The Department has commissioned ECA, Employment Conditions Abroad Ltd., a London-based firm, as consultants in connection with the review of the allowance system which the Department is currently undertaking.  ECA offers advice and assistance in devising remuneration packages for staff serving abroad.  They have been commissioned by the Department to advise on and test the design of a new, more transparent and effective system for calculating foreign allowances currently being developed by the Department.</P>
    <P>The cost of the consultancy is estimated at £6,800.  The consultancy is under way and is expected to be completed within the next month or so.  Given the nature of the consultancy, no formal report will be produced by ECA.  As the advice and assistance which ECA will make available is intended solely for internal use it is not intended to publish the findings.</P>
    <P>The Department has requested CMOD, the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, in the Department of Finance, to carry out a study of the human resources management function within the Department of Foreign Affairs and to suggest the optimum organisational arrangements for performing this function. This study is currently under way and it is hoped that it will be completed by the end of July. Given the nature of the study, there are no plans at present to publish the CMOD recommendations and there is no cost to the Department for this study.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rory McCabe was employed on a consultancy basis for the six month period from 1 January to 30 June 1998 to advise me on the major issues arising in the European Union over the six months in question, including follow-up to the Luxembourg Summit and the issues arising in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The fee payable to him is a <i>per diem</i> rate of £150, subject to a maximum of £3,000 per month, plus VAT. As his role was purely advisory the question of providing a report does not arise.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the security installations at the permanent vehicle checkpoint at the &ldquo;Camel's Hump&rdquo; in Strabane.</P>
      <P>The consistent position of the Government has been that permanent vehicle checkpoints in Border areas should be removed as soon as possible and we have pursued this with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  In response to recent inquiries within that framework, I am advised that the British authorities do not intend to remove the ramps in question at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, however, be aware that in the British-Irish Agreement the British Government committed itself to make progress towards the objective of as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland and to publish an overall security strategy dealing, <i>inter alia,</i> with the removal of security installations. The British Government also committed itelf to regular consultations with the Government on progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>In this context, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to urge upon the British authorities the importance of the early removal of such installations, including those at the &ldquo;Camel's Hump&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The passport express service, which was introduced jointly with An Post in 1995, enables passports to be issued quickly and conveniently through over 1,000 post offices throughout the country.  Persons wishing to avail of passport express do not need to travel further than their local Garda station and one of the participating post offices displaying the An Post Service Plus logo.  This service, as well as the upgrading of the Cork passport office to a full issuing office in 1995, means that the passport service is now reliable and efficient.  Over 90 per cent of all applications made in the State are dealt with within ten days.  Personal callers with genuinely urgent applications do not encounter long queues or delays at either the Cork or Dublin office.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the passport offices in Cork and Dublin are providing a high quality of service to the public and, in these circumstances, I have no plans to decentralise the Dublin office nor to open furher regional passport offices.</P>

      <P>Market studies carried out in the past in various towns did not identify sufficient interest and potential loads to make mains extension projects for such towns economically viable for Bord Gáis Éireann.  However, a more up to date internal BGE report on the provision of a natural gas supply to the town of Cavan with a possible spur to Ballyjamesduff is in the course of preparation. BGE would hope to be in a position to assess the economic viability of such an extension within the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is strongly opposed to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the THORP plant at the Sellafield complex.  Most recently, as part of the UK public consultation on proposed commissioning of the Sellafield MOX plant, my Department, in its submission to the UK Environment Agency in March 1998, called for an immediate cessation of THORP's reprocessing activities.</P>
      <P>The report referred to in the question by the Deputy is entitled &ldquo;High Level Radioactive Liquid Waste at Sellafield: Risks, Alternative Options and Lessons&rdquo; and was published in June 1998 by Dr. Gordon Thompson of the US based Institute for Resource and Security Studies.  Dr. Thompson's study was the subject of a presentation by him in Dáil Éireann last Wednesday, after which copies of the report were distributed and it is now being examined by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Notwithstanding Dr. Thompson's study, I should point out that my concerns about the storage of High Level Waste (HLW) at Sellafield have been conveyed to the UK authorities on a number of occasions.  Indeed, in recent correspondence with the UK Minister for Energy, Mr. John Battle, I called for the vitrification programme to be accelerated in order to facilitate a much earlier target date than 2015 for the clearance of the backlog of the waste.  I also requested copies of documentation on Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) which up to now BNFL has refused to release publicly on grounds of commercial confidentiality.  Departmental officials also reinforced my strong views on Sellafield's vitrification activites at a meeting with their UK counterparts earlier this month.</P>
    <P>Minister Battle has argued that the UK's independent nuclear regulator considers the HLW storage arrangements at Sellafield to be safe. However, I find it difficult to be convinced of this position without the release of detailed technical information including the contents of the PRAs. To this end, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has written to BNFL requesting that it reconsiders its refusal to make this information available.  I am also writing to Minister Battle to indicate my strong support for the RPII's request.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to highlight the Government's concerns about all operations carried out at Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government, early in 1996 as part of the CCR, approved electricity price increases of an average of 2 per cent in 1996, 1.5 per cent in 1997 and 3 per cent in 1998.  The first two phases have been implemented.  These price increases were presented as a recommendation in the CCR Agreement.</P>
      <P>They were accepted by the Government on the basis of certain projections supplied at the time by the ESB which anticipated profits of about £30 million per annum over the period 1996 to 1998. Based on actual results to date, ESB profits over the same period are expected to average over £150 million per annum.  When I met the board of ESB on 22 April 1998 the question of a price increase this year was raised and I indicated that it clearly was a matter for consideration and decision by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriateness of an increase this year is questionable having regard to the current profitability of the company.  However, this issue and the issue of tariff rebalancing is the subject of ongoing discussions with ESB. <Col N="693" /></P>

      <P>The decision on awarding the third mobile telephone licence was made by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  The powers related to issuing telecommunications licences under section 11 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, as amended, including those for mobile services, were transferred to the director under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, and the European Communities (Telecommunications Licences) Regulations, 1998.</P>
      <P>Under the 1996 Act my consent is required in relation to the making of regulations by the director to enable the grant of specific classes of licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts for the use of radio frequency spectrum.  Therefore, my consent will be required in due course for regulations providing for the issuing of radio frequency licences in the DCS 1800 band both to the existing operators and the third operator recently announced by the director following an open competition.</P>

It is open to the association at any time to present a claim concerning the rates of pay and allowances payable to personnel in the ranks represented by the association.</P>
      <P>The question of the payment of technician pay to non-commissioned personnel of the Air Corps engaged on sensor and airborne radar duties has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and is presently the subject of discussion at subcommittee level.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential and the Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>

      <Col N="696" /> I would like to add that a study of the Air Corps carried out by Price Waterhouse management consultants is presently under consideration.

      <Quest>the reason the military service allowance is not being paid to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who has served 21 years in the service as quarter master sergeant; if the rise in pension to recipients of military service allowance will be extended to non-recipients; the way in which he will deal with this anomaly; if he will backdate the gratuity payment of 48 weeks paid currently to those who retire; if so, the length of time in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force in the rank of company quartermaster-sergeant on 24 November 1985.  He was granted a pension and a gratuity appropriate to his rank and his service of 21 years in accordance with the Defence Forces pensions schemes. Under those schemes, the gratuity was based on one week's pay for each year of his service.</P>
      <P>Arising from the 1988 report of the InterDepartmental Committee on Defence Forces Pay, Allowances and Conditions, the basis for the computation of retirement gratuities was changed for soldiers retiring on or after 1 January 1989. The gratuity was increased to 25 weeks' pay in respect of 21 years' service, together with a further two weeks' pay per year in excess of 21 years up to a maximum gratuity of 45 weeks' pay in respect of 31 or more years' service.  The previous maximum gratuity was 31 weeks' pay.</P>
      <P>On foot of a recommendation made in the 1990 report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces &mdash; the Gleeson Commission &mdash; provision was made for additions to pensions and gratuities in respect of military service allowance.  This arrangement applies, subject to certain conditions, only to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.</P>
      <P>As the person in question retired prior to the effective dates of the changes mentioned, he is not eligible to benefit from these changes.</P>

    <P>The Army Equitation School currently has a total of 42 horses, of which seven are international and 22 are national standard showjumpers. The remainder is made up of eight student standard horses, four brood mares and a foal.  All horses are Irish bred.  My Department continues to source high quality Irish bred horses for the Army Equitation School for competition at home and abroad with the purpose of promoting the Irish non-thoroughbred horse.  Agreement has been reached for the purchase of two horses so far this year and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.</P>

The recommendations of the court were not uncomplicated and covered the areas of pay and equalisation of the value of the ANS and health board pension schemes.  There was no undue delay in implementing the recommendations arising from the arbitration hearing.  Arrangements are being made to pay the agreed rates of pay as quickly as possible.</P>

It is not possible at this stage to state when the proposed sale of houses in Orchard Park will be completed, but any proceeds from the sale of the houses will be treated as Appropriation-in Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of price which pig producers obtain on the market is governed by the law of supply and demand.  Currently pig production in the EU, including Ireland, is increasing, and supplies are more than adequate to meet demand. The European Union is about 108 per cent self-sufficient at present and Ireland exports more than half of its production.  Prices are therefore low throughout the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-supply in the EU has come about following severe outbreaks of classical swine fever in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Belgium, which necessitated the slaughtering of millions of pigs in these countries.  The resulting shortage of <Col N="705" /> supplies not alone drove pig prices to record levels in May of last year but also encouraged pig producers in those member states not affected by the disease to increase production.  Classical swine fever has been almost eradicated, and those member states affected are now bringing production back to pre-disease levels, adding to the over-supply situation.</P>

      <P>Under REPS all coniferous trees and hedgerows are protected as habitats.  Additionally, the implementing rules for REPS allow a person in the scheme to afforest part of his-her land and to continue to farm the remainder in REPS without any reimbursement of aid already paid.  The decision to afforest land is one for the individual farmer.  At no stage has my Department attempted to discourage coniferous afforestation.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he proposes to introduce to address the crisis in the pig industry arising out of the destruction of a company (details supplied) and ensuing loss of slaughter facilities for pig farmers along with the reduced pig meat prices and increased pigmeat importation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no indication that the recent destruction of a pigmeat slaughtering plant in County Antrim will cause difficulties for pig producers in the South, as far as slaughterings are concerned.  While it is known that the plant was sourcing some of its supplies south of the Border, it is likely that other large plants in Northern Ireland will increase their kill substantially.  In addition there is spare pigmeat slaughtering capacity in the South, which will be capable of dealing with increased slaughterings if necessary.</P>
      <P>In mid-May, at the request of a number of member states, including Ireland, the EU Commission introduced export refunds for fresh and frozen carcases, and some specified bone-in cuts. I have followed this up in the past fortnight and have requested the Commission to have export refunds extended to boneless product also.  The refunds are beginning to have the desired effect with the average Irish pigmeat price for week ending 20 June 1998 showing an upward trend.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish pigmeat importation, of the 31,300 tonnes involved in 1997, only 269 tonnes came from non-EU countries.</P>

      <P>The application of the person referred to for compensation under the scheme of assistance for weather related crop losses, 1997, could not be considered for assistance as fodder crop, animal, buildings and fencing losses did not come within the primary scope of the scheme.  The scheme was mainly targeted at the number of cereal and other crop growers whose main source of income was from arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed, and where the crop losses arising from the severe weather conditions in 1997 seriously threatened the viablilty of the farm.</P>
      <P>In view of the severe hardship experienced by some farmers who applied for compensation for fodder crop losses, I have requested my Department to re-examine all those cases where significant hardship is demonstrated and where the applicants meet the general criteria of the scheme.  The application of the person referred to will be included in this review.  When this review is completed I will be in a position to consider levels of assistance for persons who have suffered severe fodder losses.</P>

It was subsequently discovered that one parcel of land was overclaimed (parcel No. P23103063).  The headage grants were recalculated based on the reduced area and the person named was deemed to have been overpaid £276.09. This amount was automatically put on to the overpayment file for recovery.

      <P>The person named made the following applications for special beef premium in 1996: 12 animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme on 1 May 1996; 33 animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 1 May 1996; 13 animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 13 August 1996; 43 animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme on 1 November 1996; 22 animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 1 November 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on <Col N="714" /> the forage area declared on an applicants area aid application.  The person named declared 39.45 forage hectares on his area aid application and therefore was entitled to payment on a maximum of 78.9 reckonable livestock units.</P>
    <P>Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by an applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes coupled with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.</P>
    <P>The milk quota declared on the area aid application represents the following units: 31,829 divided by 897 = 35.48 livestock units.</P>
    <P>The balance of the livestock units available 43.42, 78.9-35.48, were utilised under the special beef premium scheme as follows: 12 animals × 0.6 = 7.2 livestock units; 33 animals × 1 = 33 livestock units; 5.36 animals × 0.6 = 3.22 livestock units.</P>
    <P>The EU regulations governing this scheme specifically provide that animals applied upon in excess of the individual farmers permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to have been paid the instalment applied for and specifically precluded from qualifying for that instalment of the premium at a future date. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no discretion in the matter.</P>

Consequently, it was not permissible in November 1997 for a meat plant here to slaughter cattle from Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Examination) Regulations, 1992, require the occupier of a meat plant to ensure that each bovine animal which is to be slaughtered in the plant can be identified to enable officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food to determine its origin.</P>

      <QRef>[16121/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the concerns expressed by the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association (ICSA) in relation to the CAP reform negotiations and, in particular, on the need for full compensation for any reduction in the intervention price for beef.  I have already made it clear to the Commissioner and the Agriculture Council that the reform proposals are not acceptable and that substantial improvements will have to be made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the ICSA view that further increases are required in the case of the suckler cow premium and that the supplementary suckler cow premium should be retained.  However, the replacement of the two instalments of the special beef premium by an area-based premium could result in reduced premium income for Irish producers, particularly in view of the consequential <Col N="720" /> loss of the extensification premium.  Furthermore, there is little or no support from other member states for such an approach.  The ICSA suggestion for a forage area premium could be accommodated, in part at least, through payments from the proposed national envelopes, which provide for payments to be made either on cattle or forage area.  With regard to the extensification premium,</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the implications of the proposal to base this premium on real stocking density but it is unrealistic to expect that it will be possible to secure the exclusion of heifers and sheep from the calculation of stocking density.  A more practical solution might be to increase the maximum stocking density limit of 1.4lu-ha for this premium.  I have already made strong representation to the EU Commission for the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheepmeat sector.  However, the EU Commission has not accepted this proposal on the grounds that the round world premium, which was introduced in the content of the 1992 reform, is of major benefit to the majority of extensive sheep producers in the Union.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed increase in the special premium for bulls, it is not practicable in a European context to attempt to target this premium on dry stock producers and on small dairy quota holders.  The introduction of national envelope will, however, enable member states to better target compensation at those producers most seriously affected by the reduction in the intervention price.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the Commission's proposals are an early stage and I am confident that, as they progress, significant improvements can be achieved.  I am conscious of the particular concerns of drystock producers and I will spare no effort in seeking to ensure they are taken into account in any final settlement.</P>

      <P>Consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works to report on areas in the Owenmore-Arrow River catchments in County Sligo likely to benefit from flood relief works identified the Owenmore River as being the only area where such works would be feasible from an economic and environmental viewpoint.

The fact that the Arrow River catchment is of international ecological importance and listed to be designated as a natural heritage area &mdash; NHA &mdash; and special area of conservation &mdash; SAC &mdash; by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands precludes the implementation of any scheme of works in that area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>The 2.25 per cent referred to by Deputy Yates is a general round increase payable under Partnership 2000.  Sanction has been conveyed for the payment of this amount to secretarial assistants and such payments will be included in pay cheques dated 3 July 1998.  No arrears are payable in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last week, my Department has received a large number of claims from secretarial assistants who are contracted to individual Deputies and Senators and to political parties for the implementation of a special deal under the terms of clause 2(iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  I have recently agreed to the terms of such a deal, the details of which have <Col N="725" /> been sent to the administrators of the various political parties.  Secretarial assistants attached to Independent Deputies and to smaller parties will be contacted separately.</P>
    <P>Secretarial assistants will be paid in accordance with the new scale as soon as possible. The payment of arrears, the calculation of which must be carried out manually and requires input from both a personnel and accounts perspective, will take somewhat longer.  Discussions are currently under way with those concerned in order to agree when the arrears can be calculated and paid. <Col N="726" /></P>

      <P>All IT units in the Civil Service comply with a common set of technical principles &mdash; one of which is the avoidance, wherever possible, of the use of multiple software products within their respective organisations to meet the same need.  As a result, a narrower range of software products are used by Departments and offices than would be the case for organisations with less restrictive software acquisition practices.  Competitive tendering exercises are used to acquire software.  The intended use for the software and the number of licences required are specified in the request for tender document that issues to the market.  All subsequent acquisitions of the chosen software are subject to contract.  There is, therefore, a high degree of transparency between the software supplier and the Department involved in relation to the number of licences required.</P>
      <P>In the context of on-going IT review meetings with individual Departments and offices, my Department will request each of them to ensure that similar arrangements apply within bodies under their aegis.</P>
      <P>Consideration has already been given by my Department to the use of centralised framework contracts for the licensing of software and for acquiring commodity hardware &mdash; for example, PCs, printers etc.  As a result of legal advice, which suggested that the use of framework contracts was probably in breach of EU procurement law, it was decided not to proceed with this type of arrangement.  Consideration is currently being given in the EU Commission to allowing framework arrangements in a future revision of procurement law.  Should this come into effect, consideration will be given once again to centralised licensing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to extend the proposed pilot rural renewal scheme to include residential owner occupier benefits.  This would mean giving tax relief to the owners of all new houses or to owners who carry out refurbishment on their houses in two counties and in a significant portion of three other counties.  Apart from the dead-weight effect of giving tax relief to what many such owners would have been doing in any event, such very generous treatment would be resented by the inhabitants of other counties who would inevitably demand a similar concession.  As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, all this would be extremely costly to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>We do not have incentives or measures under Irish tax law which are specifically aimed at promoting ethical investment and it would be very difficult to design suitable provisions in this regard in the absence of internationally agreed guidelines or authoritative recommendations on the subject. Nor are there any plans to modify the tax treatment of pension fund investment in order to encourage ethical investment by the pensions funds.  The existing treatment provides for tax free pension contributions by employers, employees and the self-employed, tax free roll up of investments by the pension funds and the taxation of pension payments in the hands of the recipient.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that at the very least there would need to be a clear and broadly accepted definition of what constitutes ethical investments before the appropriateness of introducing tax incentives or of modifying the tax treatment of pension fund investment could be properly examined.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the revised stamp duty rates introduced by the Government as part of a package in response to the issue of rising house prices.  Part II of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, provides for the reduced rates of stamp duty on residential property.  These rates apply to conveyances dated on or after 23 April 1998.  Any conveyance which took place prior to 23 April, 1998 would have been liable for the previous rates of duty.  Given that at that time the old rates of stamp duty would have been the appropriate rates requests for refunds of stamp duty paid at the old rates prior to 23 April 1998 have all been refused.  Any reduction in the rate of a tax must have a commencement date.  It is long standing policy that refunds of tax sought as a result of reductions in tax rates are refused.  I do not intend to depart from this policy.</P>

      <P>The new tax initiative that I introduced in this year's Finance (No. 1) Act to help the long-term unemployed back into employment is generally referred to as the revenue job assist scheme.  This scheme is, essentially, a two part initiative.  The first part of the initiative provides a special tax deduction in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance is tapered over a three year period.  The second part of the initiative is a double tax deduction for employers who employ the long-term unemployed person.  The double deduction will cover wages and employer's PRSI contributions and can last up to 36 months provided the previously long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.</P>
      <P>To be eligible under the scheme a long-term unemployed individual must have been unemployed, for at least 12 months and in receipt of either an unemployment payment (unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance) or the one-parent family allowance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The section also allows time spent on certain activities, programmes or courses for the unemployed in certain circumstances, to be taken into account for calculating the 12 months mentioned above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new scheme has only been up and running for a very short period and while I consider it to be too early at this stage to start changing the terms of the scheme, I can assure the Deputy that they will be kept under review. <Col N="731" /></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17 July 1997 agreement was reached between representatives of the drug treatment centre and the union representing staff relating to the enhancement of services within the centre. On 18 July 1997 a High Court action by local traders prohibited any enhancement of services until the traders' case was resolved.  On legal advice the board of the drug treatment centre was precluded from ratifying the agreement pending resolution of the High Court action.  A High Court settlement was finally agreed on 4 March 1998 when the proposed enhancement process recommenced.  Since that date the drug treatment centre has been working to implement the terms of the agreement.  At a meeting last Thursday, 25 June, between representatives of staff, the drug treatment centre board, IMPACT, the Health Service Employers Agency and my Department, agreement was reached on pay and conditions and the implementation dates of the terms of the agreement and my Department is working closely with the Eastern Health Board and the drug treatment centre to ensure that the implementation dates will be adhered to and that all the terms of the agreement will be fully implemented at the earliest possible date. <Col N="735" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.  Children are assessed therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department in 1985 to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the 1985 guidelines. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.  The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>Waiting times for mammograms vary between hospitals depending on the urgency of cases. Urgent appointments are seen as quickly as possible and while the demand for mammograms is high, hospitals make every effort to cater for women seeking appointments as soon as possible. Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.  I am very conscious of the importance of mammography services and I am strongly committed to developing mammography services in the context of the national cancer strategy. <Col N="736" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 262, 276 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has not carried out a study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in Ireland. However it is recognised that the availability of more detailed information is this regard will help to inform future policy in relation to the disease. A multi-institutional study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population generally is planned, the majority of the funding for which will be provided by the Health Research Board.  This study is expected to commence shortly.  My Department has also received a proposal from a hospital for a study to examine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C in women of child bearing age.  This proposal is currently being considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Disease Regulations, 1981.  Each health board is statutorily required to notify my Department on a weekly basis of the number of cases of the disease reported in its area.  The number of cases of hepatitis B notified to my Department from 1988 to date is as follows: 1988 &mdash; 32; 1989 &mdash; 20; 1990 &mdash; 11; 1991 &mdash; 15; 1992 &mdash; 13; 1993 &mdash; 11; 1994 &mdash; 20; 1995 &mdash; 11; 1996 &mdash; 10; 1997 &mdash; 26; 1998 &mdash; 74 (up to 22 May, the latest date for which complete returns are available).</P>
      <P>In the 12 month period to 22 May 1998, 95 cases of hepatitis B were notified.  The corresponding figure for the preceding twelve-month period was 14.  Information on the possible means by which the disease has been contracted in individual cases is not routinely collected by my Department.  It is not possible to indicate the cost to the health service of treating cases of hepatitis B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of cases notified to my Department indicates that the incidence of hepatitis B in Ireland is low.  While the WHO has recommended the introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, several low-incidence countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, have instead initiated a selective approach which targets high risk groups.  It has been considered that this represents a more effective <Col N="738" /> approach in situations where the incidence of the disease is low and where cases occur in identifiable population groups.  There are no plans at present for a general education programme regarding hepatitis B. The health promotion unit has produced an information leaflet on the disease, giving information about how the disease is contracted, the precautions which should be taken by persons at risk and the symptoms and treatment available.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy on immunisation against hepatitis B is guided by the advice of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, whose guidelines recommend immunisation for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors such as close contact with a case or carrier.</P>
    <P>In respect of workers within the health service, my Department wrote to all health boards and voluntary agencies in June 1997 stressing the importance of vaccination for &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; health care staff and clients.  This was a reiteration of earlier advice.  Since 1 January 1997 all new health service employees who will be involved in exposure-prone procedures are routinely screened for hepatitis B. No applicant will be allowed to commence employment unless these procedures are followed.  All new employees in the category concerned must provide documentary evidence that they are not infectious carriers of the hepatitis B virus.</P>
    <P>The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is currently reviewing its existing guidelines on immunisation, and future vaccination strategy for hepatitis B is among the issues which my Department's chief medical officer has asked the committee to consider in the course of its review.</P>

      <P>As was announced by the Taoiseach on 22 June last, the Government has decided to set up 12 pilot projects for children at risk and has allocated £2.4 million per annum for this purpose over the three year period 1998-2000. The location of the projects will be approved by the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion who will take into account the recommendations of an assessment committee on the merits of particular proposals.  The intention is to base the projects in areas of social deprivation where there is a need to ensure better co-ordination of services for children at risk.  These projects will be in addition to a number of projects already under way in the Dublin area which were initiated under the national drugs strategy.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals.  However, as the determination of eligibility of the person concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>Group Topic &mdash; National AIDS Strategy Committee recommendation on routine ante-natal HIV testing</P>
    <P>The national AIDS strategy committee in March 1998 recommended that routine ante-natal testing for HIV commence as soon as possible throughout the country because of the improved outcomes for both mother and child if HIV is treated during pregnancy.  A committee has been set up to examine the current situation and to implement a programme of testing at the earliest opportunity.  The committee has met once since the first meeting which took place on 22 April 1998.  A sub-committee was established to address aspects of the testing programme and to prepare a draft protocol for examination by the main committee which will meet in September.</P>

      <P>Every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care.  Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.  Under these arrangements consultants' private patients must ordinarily be accommodated in private or semi-private beds, while consultants' public patients must ordinarily be accommodated in public beds.  In cases of emergency, patients will, of course, be accommodated in whatever bed is available.  The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could, in non-emergency situations, receive preferential treatment over the public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed.</P>

The new legislation will include an inspectorate system which will be responsible for monitoring the quality of care of patients in the mental health services.

      <P>My Department is involved in many initiatives to raise awareness concerning problems caused in society by drug misuse.  In the years 1998-9 my Department through its health promotion unit will continue to work with the Department of Education and Science on the dissemination and implementation of the &lsquo;On My Own Two Feet&rsquo; programme for second level schools.  This programme is also being extended into primary schools.  European drug prevention week is taking place from November 15-20 1998 and the focus of this week is to raise awareness about the requirement for intersectoral co-operation to tackle the drug problem.  Allied to this week will be a media awareness campaign promoting the week and promoting awareness about the dangers of drug misuse.  The total amount allocated by my Department to this week and to the associated awareness campaign for 1998 is £250,000.  My Department continues to facilitate the dissemination of a community based drugs awareness programme &lsquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rsquo; and is achieving considerable success with this programme in many health board areas.  In addition to the above initiatives the health promotion unit of my Department continues to make available a wide range of literature, leaflets, information booklets and posters for young people, parents and health professionals on the issue of drug misuse. <Col N="750" /></P>

    <P>I am satisfied that, in accordance with the general international consensus, the benefits of vaccination programmes far outweigh the potential risks and help to protect children from the serious consequences of a range of previously prevalent diseases.  I wish to add that all vaccines are extensively tested for safety and efficacy before licensing and that surveillance is maintained after they are licensed.  I take this opportunity to emphasise the importance of vaccination against these diseases and to encourage parents to avail of the free service provided by general practitioners in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 277, 278, 279 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion of breastfeeding continues to be a priority for my Department and the need to increase its incidence is referred to in the national breastfeeding strategy, the health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a healthier future&rdquo; and the health promotion strategy.  Subsequent to the launch of the national breastfeeding strategy in 1994 a departmental working group was set up.  This group liaised with the health boards and encouraged them to set in place structures to facilitate breastfeeding, primarily through the establishment of representatives in each health board area who are responsible for breastfeeding promotion.</P>
      <P>The national lifestyles survey currently being undertken for my Department by the Centre for Health Promotion Studies in University College Galway also includes a component on breastfeeding which will provide my Department with detailed data on patterns and incidence of breastfeeding.  It has generally been recognised that the immediate support of health professionals is essential to achieving an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding.  The encouragement and advice of this group is critical as they help expectant mothers form opinions both during pregnancy and immediately after birth.  For these reasons, the health promotion unit of my Department provided funding for the production of a training pack for health professionals which was developed in conjunction with the Centre for Health Promotion Studies in University College Galway and An Bord Altranais.  This pack provides health professionals with the necessary expertise to encourage and assist mothers with breastfeeding and has been widely disseminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department continues to promote breastfeeding via publications such as &ldquo;Breast Fed is Best Fed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Food and Babies&rdquo; both of which are available throughout the country from the health promotion offices in each of the health board areas.  My Department continues to provide funding to voluntary organisations such as the La Le che Leagus, the Irish Childbirth Trust and the Association of Lactation Consultants and in this regard the Deputy may wish to note that my Department approved a grant of £10,000 to the La Le che League this month. <Col N="752" /></P>

      <P>Health boards provide services for persons who have been the victims of abuse and they are currently resourced for this purpose.  Adult victims of abuse may avail of counselling through the psychiatric services, psychology services or social work services.  With regard to abuse within swimming, the Eastern Health Board set up a free phone help line for abuse victims in February 1998.  The help line was available for one week from 9 to 13 February, from 11.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. each day and 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday.  The volume of calls to the help line did not indicate that it was required for any further period at that stage.  The board has established other help lines required during the last number of years.  Callers to this help line from other health board areas were referred to the appropriate service in their own boards.  Health board personnel liaise in relation to such referrals.</P>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the motorised transport grant scheme is to provide assistance to people with disabilities who need a car in order to gain or retain employment.  However, health boards may also give sympathetic consideration to applications from people with a disability who are living in a very isolated area.  Payment of the grant is subject to a means test, which is based on the average weekly industrial earnings.  The rate of grant payable is linked to the level of income. Responsibility for publicising the motorised transport grant rests with the individual health boards.  I am unaware of any major inconsistencies in the operation of the motorised transport grant scheme.  If the Deputy has information in this regard, I will be pleased to investigate the matter further for him.</P>

      <P>I understand that health boards assess for means tested services on the basis of the joint income of the co-habitees, whether married or unmarried. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be <Col N="754" /> awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>

      <P>Provision was made for 659 parking spaces at the new hospital in Tallaght as part of the original building project.  This number was in line with planning regulations at that time.  Due to the large increase in car ownership since the plans were finalised, the Department agreed in 1997 to a proposal from the hospital for the development of a 500 space public multi-storey pay car park for patients and visitors which would bring the total number of spaces on site to 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to a continued presence of the builders on site, some 470 spaces are currently available for staff.  The policy of the hospital is that availability of car parking on site should be as equitable as possible based on need rather than grade or position. Priority is given to on-call staff and to shift workers who start or finish their work outside normal hours and to those staff who need their cars during the day for work purposes.  The hospital estimates that the number of staff spaces available on site will increase by at least 100 over the next few months.  The hospital management recognised that there would be further demand from staff for parking over and above the spaces currently available and have negotiated an arrangement with The Square Shopping Centre for the dedicated use of 300 secure spaces in levels 5 and 6 of its multi-storey car park from <Col N="755" /> 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The hospital has also arranged that a free shuttle bus will run every ten minutes between the Square and the main hospital entrance from 6.45 am to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and from 12 noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays. There is no doubt that parking spaces available for staff and public at the new hospital is a marked improvement on the facilities available at the base hospitals.  It is understandable that some people will take time to adjust to the situation at Tallaght but I am satisfied that management at the hospital will ensure that the needs of staff and patients will be met in the most equitable manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, accompanied by an officer of my Department, met the Post Polio Support Group on 25 February 1998 in Leinster House.  The discussions covered research on post polio syndrome or the late effects of polio and current medical knowledge about the condition; the provision of therapy services and aids and applicances required by persons suffering from the condition and funding for these items and, in addition, the impact of the cost of the disability on such persons was addressed; a request to establish a trust fund to support the group and the automatic granting of medical cards for persons suffering with the post polio condition and plans for a conference by the Post Polio Support Group in 1999 and the establishment, in the health boards, of a database in relation to people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other voluntary sector groups providing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, requisite action arising in the context of the Post Polio Support Group is based <Col N="756" /> on the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, published in December 1996.  That report sets out the requirements for the development of services for people with a physical and sensory disability.  In the context of the Post Polio Support Group's requirements for the overall development of services, two key recommendations in &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, which was addressed at the meeting, are the establishment of co-ordinating committees within each health board and the establishment of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>Health boards, in consultation with the co-ordinating committees, will decide priorities for allocating the additional monies made available by the Government for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities while the establishment of the database is crucial to identifying priorities for the development of such services.  The co-ordinating committees have been established within each health board and, following the recent completion of a joint database pilot project in three health board areas, I will shortly be setting up a national database development committee.  The additional funding made available by this Government &mdash; £10 million in 1997 and £8.4 million in 1998 &mdash; for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities represents a major step towards meeting the recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to other matters raised at the meeting, namely, research into post polio syndrome and automatic entitlement to medical cards for members of the group, I will be glad to facilitate in whatever way I can the dissemination of information to the medical profession arising from research in this field.  Previous Governments did not feel that it was justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without reference to their means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  The Government has identified, as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department has asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to consider the commitment and to give their views as to how it might be implemented and the implications, financial and otherwise of their proposals.  I expect to have the views of the chief executive officers shortly.  With regard to the provision of physiotherapy services at Beaumont Hospital, this matter was not raised by the Post Polio Support Group at the meeting mentioned above or in any other representations made to me.  I understand that a physiotherapy service is available at Beaumont Hospital for post <Col N="757" /> polio patients who are admitted to the hospital and referred for physiotherapy.  Post polio sufferers who are living in the community would have recourse to community therapy services.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental services to eligible persons on Arranmore Island, County Donegal is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board.  I have been advised by the North-Western Health Board that the board has had difficulties in recent times in recruiting an adequate number of dentists for the west Donegal area and this has, in particular, affected the service on Arranmore Island.  It has not been possible for the board to provide regular dental services on the island for over a year.  People from Arranmore are, however, able to avail of dental services in Dungloe.  The board accepts that this is inconvenient to these people.  I and the board regret this.  However, the board has advised me that the principal dental officer in Donegal is making arrangements to have any waiting lists for dental treatment on Arranmore carried out over the coming weeks by sending a dental team to the island.  The board is making strenuous efforts to recruit additional dentists for west Donegal and hopes that its efforts will be successful in the near future.</P>

The provision of primary and secondary level education for persons with autism is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science. Statutory responsibility for the provision of health services to persons with autism is vested in the eight regional health boards.  My Department published a policy document in 1994, &ldquo;Services for Persons with Autism&rdquo; and the health boards have incorporated the development of services to persons with autism into their regional plans in line with this policy document.  The Department of Education and Science is currently in the process of establishing a number of special classes for children with autism in the Eastern Health Board area and in a number of other locations around <Col N="758" /> the country.  The health boards, in conjunction with my Department, are working to provide health related support services to the educational services provided for children with autism by the Department of Education and Science.  It is hoped that the child in question will be accommodated in this context.</P>

The board will decide, in consultation with the local co-ordinating committee for people with physical and sensory disabilities, on priorities for expenditure of this funding.  I also allocated an additional £3 million capital funding this year for the above mentioned services.  Proposals by the <Col N="760" /> health boards for the expenditure of this funding, including proposals for increased expenditure on aids and appliances, are under consideration by my Department.

      <P>Home care attendants operate as part of a district care unit.  A district care unit is a community-based service to enable older people to continue living in their home environment by providing a multi-discipline input, including the employment of home care attendants.  Initially 140 hours per week were approved by the Eastern Health Board for the district care unit in Kildare, which is equivalent to three and a half full time home care attendants.  In 1997, an additional 30 hours was approved by the board, thereby increasing the total to approximately four full time posts.  I understand from the board that there are plans to provide an additional 100 hours per week for Kildare, thus increasing the number of full time posts to seven.  It is intended to concentrate these new resources in south Kildare.  The Eastern Health Board reports that the scheme has proved to be successful in Kildare and the proposed extension of the scheme will further enhance home support to a larger number of families. <Col N="761" /></P>

Since 1997, a total of £4.6 million has been allocated to the development of palliative care services.

As part of the national cancer strategy, regional directors of cancer services have been appointed in each health board to co-ordinate services and develop a detailed service plan for their region, including palliative care.  In addition a national cancer forum has been established to provide a focal point for communication and co-ordination of services.  The forum will advise on the development of palliative care nationally, particularly in relation to training and personnel.  I recently met with representatives of the Irish Hospice Foundation and I am considering how best to progress the matters raised by the foundation.</P>

These are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office in particular is currently experiencing a very high level of demand for certificates which had given rise to particular difficulties in recent times. Measures have been taken to improve the situation including the provision of additional accommodation and additional staff.  The assignment of six additional staff to the Superintendent Registrar by the Eastern Health Board, which is <Col N="762" /> responsible for the administration of that office, has increased the rate of production of certificates and this has improved the service to the customers. Further additional staff have been sanctioned by my Department for the registration service.  There is also some delay dealing with postal applications for certificates of births, deaths and marriages in the General Register office.  The overall staffing situation in my Department, including the General Register Officer is kept under review and a number of vacancies are in the process of being filled at present. Pressures which arise as a result of fluctuations in demand for services or temporary staff shortages are normally addressed by short periods of overtime.

      <P>The European Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland in the European Court on 5 December, 1996 for alleged failure to adequately transpose the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment (85/337/EEC).  The action by the Commission primarly relates to one aspect of Ireland's transposition of the directive i.e. the levels at which EIA should be required for projects involving afforestation, peat extraction and intensification of agriculture. In its defence Ireland has contended that full effect has been given in Ireland to the directive since the introduction of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 and other relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>A full defence has been lodged and an oral hearing requested.  A date for the hearing is awaited from the European Court of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility to prevent pollution incidents rests with those engaged in activities that could entail a pollution risk. However, as statutory pollution control authorities, local authorities have a key role in protecting water resources.  The EPA is also responsible in so far as activities licensable by the Agency are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 28 of 6 May, 1998 and 125 of 10 June, 1998 concerning steps I have taken in regard to the intensification, by local authorities, of efforts to prevent and deal with pollution of our inland waterways through the implementation of the full range of statutory powers available to the authorities.  These replies also provide details of my Department's comprehensive Catchement-Based Strategy Against Eutrophication, Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes which aims at preventing any further decline in water quality and restoring waters currently <Col N="765" /> affected by pollution.  A copy of the strategy is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The catchment strategy also involves a major capital investment by my Department in upgraded sewage treatment facilities throughout the country, including provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where warranted in light of local water quality conditions.  This sewerage investment programme provides for £1.3 billion up to 2005, with a record £184.6 million provided by my Department for investment in sewage schemes and water supplies in the current year. Catchment based projects supported by the Cohesion Fund provide, in addition, for comprehensive monitoring and management systems which will enable pollution control strategies to be tailored to the particular needs of the local situation.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that local authorities have adequate resources to carry out their statutory water pollution control functions, and I have, in particular, urged them to use the full range of powers and remedies available under the Water Pollution Acts, including the provisions consistent with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle to deal with pollution incidents and risks, substantially increased funding will be available from 1999 under the new Local Government Fund to meet the day-to-day expenditure, generally, of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Agreement was reached at the meeting of the EU Council of Environment Ministers in Luxembourg on 16-17 June 1998 relating to the contribution of member states towards the reduction of 8 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions to be achieved by the EU as a whole under the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This includes a commitment by Ireland to limit the increase in our net emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases &mdash; carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N4O), hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  In preparation for the June meeting I consulted with my Government colleagues in regard to Ireland's contribution to the overall EU target.  The Government was aware of the findings of a consultancy <Col N="766" /> study on the Limitation and Reduction of CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland which was commissioned by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise. The study was published on 22 June 1998 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The Government was also aware of the November 1997 ESRI report The Costs to Ireland of Greenhouse Gas Abatement.</P>
      <P>The published studies confirm that trends in greenhouse gas emissions vary according to the particular gases and their sectoral sources, and that with the appropriate choices of policies and measures, the target can be achieved without adverse impact on economic growth.</P>
      <P>I have announced the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy, to be approved by Government after widespread consultation. I am satisfied that this can be developed in a manner that reflects our continuing need for sustainable economic growth and the necessity to make an ambitious but achievable contribution to the overall EU target.</P>

      <P>The National Safety Council has produced an information leaflet on traffic rules for tourists which is distributed, free of charge, to the major car hire companies and car hire offices, including all of the firms operating from the airports and ferry terminals, to Bord Fáilte and to local authorities.  The leaflet is in English, French and German and provides information on the rules of the road in Ireland, including clear advice that all traffic must drive on the left.  The council has also developed a multilingual dashboard sticker which reminds tourists to drive on the left and to wear a seat belt.  This sticker is distributed to car hire companies.</P>
      <P>A multi-lingual road traffic sign to warn drivers of the requirement to drive on the left-hand side of the road was introduced in 1996.  The sign is designed for use, in particular, at exits from ports and airports and in areas of high tourist amenity. Detailed specifications for the sign are set out in a comprehensive traffic signs manual, published by my Department in December, 1996, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The provision of these signs is a matter for road authorities.</P>

      <P>Statutory provisions governing roadside trees and vegetation are contained in section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993.  These provisions oblige landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that trees, shrubs, hedges or any other vegetation on their land are not, or could not become, a danger to road users.</P>
      <P>Where a local authority considers that a hazard exists they may serve notices on landowners and occupiers of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger.  The local authority can carry out the works specified in the notice itself in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply with it.  They may also carry out additional works which they consider necessary.  Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users the local authority can act at once, without serving a notice, to remove or reduce the danger.  In either case, the local authority may recover its cost of the works from the landowner or occupier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that these powers are properly designed to enable local authorities to take action, in the interests of road safety in relation to roadside obstructions.  At the same time, local authorities have been advised that, in the exercise of these powers, they should also be aware of their responsibilities in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities. <Col N="768" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 318 together.</P>
      <P>Census 91, Volume 10, Housing, published by the CSO in February 1997 provides detailed information on domestic sanitary facilities nationally and shows that a total of 344,635 housing units were connected to septic tank systems.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, and An Bord Pleanála on appeal, to attach the appropriate conditions in any planning permission granted involving the on-site disposal of effluent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of disposal by way of a septic tank, the Standard Recommendation for Septic Tank Systems, S.R.6: 1991, drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, was brought to the attention of local authorities by way of Circular <Col N="770" /> Letter PD1/92 of 8 January 1992.  Local authorities were requested, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that septic tank and percolation systems were properly installed in accordance with the planning permission granted and the standard recommendation.</P>
    <P>The standard recommendation provides guidance for the proper maintenance of septic tanks by way of regular desludging and the proper disposal of the sludge.  Primary responsibility for ensuring proper maintenance of septic tanks and compliance with any relevant planning conditions rests with the owners of the septic tanks.  In the Department's Circular Letter PD 1/92, local authorities were requested to consider appropriate educational, publicity and advisory measures on proper maintenance and desludging regimes for septic tanks.</P>
    <P>The EPA recently published a report on small scale waste water systems which includes an assessment of smallscale systems and draft guidelines for the selection, design, operation and maintenance of these systems.  In addition, my Department together with the EPA and the GSI are at present, finalising a groundwater protection scheme for Ireland, together with a draft groundwater protection response for waste water treatment systems for single houses which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, also have a full range of powers and remedies available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, to deal with any pollution or potential pollution from septic tanks.</P>
    <P>Under the group sewerage schemes programme, which is administered by county councils, grants of up to £1,600 per house are available to groups of householders who come together to provide common sewerage facilities to their properties in cases where existing systems are defective and giving rise to pollution.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1995 (S.  I. No. 192 of 1995) provide that a licensing authority may not issue first licences for certain new vehicles, including passenger cars, unless each application for such a licence includes a declaration by the vehicle manufacturer or its authorised representative that a certificate of conformity with the air pollutant emission stardards specified in Directive 94/12/EC has been issued by the manufacturer in respect of the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Entry into Service) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 211 of 1998) which transpose the entry into service requirement of Directive 93/81/EC into Irish law will replace the earlier regulations with effect from 1 October 1998.  Directive 93/81/EC requires member states to prohibit the entry into service of new passenger cars which are not accompanied by valid certificates <Col N="775" /> of conformity with relevant EU standards.</P>
    <P>The new regulations require that the declaration to the Revenue Commissioners for first registration of all new cars must include such certificates of conformity.  The regulations do not apply to previously registered cars.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a vehicle is a new car in accordance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the directive in question it is open to a member state to consider making exemptions to the general requirement to provide certificates of conformity in certain limited circumstances and subject to the agreement of other member states.  A prerequisite for consideration of any such application for a particular vehicle type in Ireland would be satisfactory independent evidence that the vehicle type in question met acceptable standards for road safety and environmental protection.</P>

      <P>A detailed examination of the issues that arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats concluded that no practical arrangement could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers or local authorities or even to other tenants in a flat complex who would not wish to purchase.  The three main reasons why local authority flats would be a bad buy for tenants relate to: the level of service charges that would be necesssary; public liability insurance; and the future saleability of purchased flats.</P>
      <P>These matters were outlined in detail in the 1995 policy document Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were, therefore, advised that flats should not be offered for sale under the current tenant purchase scheme, but that authorities should give consideration to the sale of maisonettes, particularly those which do not have common areas, where satisfactory arrangements, not involving the difficulties that arise in the case of flats, could be devised.  The difficulties and disadvantages for tenants of purchasing local authority flats which have been clearly identified still apply and there are no proposals to amend the scheme in this respect.</P>

      <P>The Thomastown sewerage scheme is included in my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme to be advanced through planning in 1998.  A brief for the appointment of consultants for this scheme was approved on 28 January 1998.</P>

      <P>The operation of the physical planning code, which is the responsibility of my Department, and other codes and initiatives, including the Habitats Regulations and the REPS, which do not come within the responsibility of my Department, have a vital role in the protection of the landscape.  In this regard, the implementation of the provisions of the planning code is a matter for the individual local planning authorities.</P>
      <P>Land use planning guidelines published by my Department are also relevant in the context of protecting the landscape: such guidelines have already been published in relation to telecommunications antennae and support structures and wind farm development and draft consultation guidelines have been published in relation to forestry development.  There is also a range of current proposals which are, at least in part, designed to enhance this protection.</P>
      <P>Principal among these are: the current review of planning legislation which is now nearing completion; the preparation of new draft land use planning guidelines on high amenity landscapes and on the scope and content of development plans; and the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which is currently in preparation by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>I believe that all the existing landscape protection measures, taken together with the initiatives outlined above, will ensure an increasingly effective regime for the conservation and preservation of the national landscape.</P>

      <P>A key aim of national road development policy as set out in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 is to link in with the road network in Northern Ireland so as to provide, over time, a coherent strategic road network for the island as a whole. There has already been extensive contact and co-operation on the part of my Department, the NRA and individual road authorities with the Northern Ireland road authorities.  These have ensured that changes in the nature and extent of cross border traffic are factored into the roads planning process.</P>
      <P>Strategic transport planning is one of the candidate areas identified for North-South co-operation and implementation by the Multi-Party Agreement of 10 April 1998.  My Department and its partner roads agencies will co-operate fully in any intensified North-South action developed on this basis.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered by the eight health boards and the Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Section 181 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, makes provisions under the SWA scheme for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.  These payments are known as exceptional needs payments (ENPs).</P>
      <P>There is no automatic right of entitlement to an ENP.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  The person concerned made an application for an ENP towards the cost of the financial expenses of a couple, one of whom died on 14 February 1998.  The second person died on 13 April 1998.  An application for assistance with the funeral expenses was made three weeks ago at which time the community welfare officer requested a copy of the will.  The copy of the will was received on the 25 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The application is currently under consideration by the superintendent community welfare officer and the person concerned will be notified of the decision on the claim as soon as possible. If the person concerned is not happy with the decision when given, he can lodge an appeal with the appeals officer in the health board.</P>

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established in 1996 to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the scheme's services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as window locks, door chains and locks and security <Col N="785" /> lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems. Funding is not available for conventional burglar alarms under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Older people, aged 65 or over, who live alone or in households made up exclusively of older and/or other dependent vulnerable people and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves, can benefit from the scheme.</P>
    <P>Older people, aged 66 or over, who live alone or in households with other dependent people can benefit from free schemes such as the free electricity/gas allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance.  Concessions to the living alone requirements may apply to certain people over the age of 75, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The only free scheme to which the living alone requirements does not apply is the free travel pass as every person over the age of 66, who is resident in the State, has an universal entitlement to a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>As the eligibility conditions for assistance under both the scheme of community support for older people and the free schemes are quite different, it is not possible within the terms of the scheme, to provide an automatic entitlement to funding for security equipment.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputy is aware, the objective of this scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  I am anxious therefore to ensure that the scheme remains focused and provides assistance to the most vulnerable older people, and does so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  As the outcome of this review will not be available until later this year, the scheme will, in the meantime, continue to operate in its present form.</P>

There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or on suburban rail services in Dublin and Cork, or on services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country. These restrictions have been in operation since the inception of the scheme in 1967.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these restrictions, is to ensure that adequate space is available on the bus services of Dublin Bus and the city bus services in Cork and Limerick for commuters to and from work and school.</P>
      <P>An exception to the peak time travel restrictions is made in the case of people in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension who attend recognised long-term rehabilitation courses and for certain invalidity pensioners engaged on work experience programmes.  These clients are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The question of extending unrestricted access to urban services at peak time to other groups with special needs is kept under review and the Department will continue to monitor the situation in consultation with the CIE group to assess the scope of improvements having regard to cost and other constraints.</P>

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established in 1996 on foot of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Security for the Elderly.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are made available to voluntary organisations and community groups such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the assistance provided under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme once-off grants can be made towards the cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as window locks, door chains and locks and security equipment; and socially-monitored alarm systems &mdash; telephone emergency and alert systems.</P>
      <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder/burglar alarms.</P>
      <P>The scheme is focused on older people, aged 65 or over, who live alone or in households made up exclusively of older and/or other dependent vulnerable people and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  However, the actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>The 1998 scheme was announced in the national and local newspapers on 9 April 1998 with a closing date of 22 May 1998.  A sum of £2 million has been allocated to the scheme for 1998.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>if it is the policy of her Department to discourage coniferous afforestation by any means in areas covered by national heritage areas, special areas of conservation or special protection area designations or in areas where landowners have committed to the REP scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15863/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera) Síle de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to ensure that the ecological interest of sites of special ecological importance are conserved. The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, provide for the control of forestry, including coniferous afforestation, in proposed candidate special areas of conservation (SACs) and special protection areas (SPAs).  Within proposed candidate SACs, consent must be obtained from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands before potentially damaging activities can be carried out.  In most proposed candidate SACs, consent must be obtained before trees can be planted and, in some habitats, before tree felling or the removal of timber.</P>
      <P>In regard to all sites of special ecological importance, the general policy is not to grant-aid forestry where it would be likely to have a detrimental effect on the ecological interest of such sites.  For example, it is a specific provision of the forest grant scheme administered by the forest service that applications in respect of areas designated or proposed for designation as SACs or SPAs are ineligible for grant aid in cases where this would damage the ecological interest.  The National Parks and Wildlife section of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, is also consulted by the forest service in relation to projects which might adversely affect proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs).</P>
      <P>With regard to the rural environment protection scheme and forestry, while this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, I understand that areas covered by the scheme are not eligible for grant-aid in respect of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations are also relevant.  Presently, initial afforestation above the threshold of 70 hectares and the replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifers above a threshold ten hectares require planning permission and an EIA.  The 70 hectare threshold for initial afforestation, which will be reviewed in three years, is a reduction from that of 200 hectares which applied until October 1996. In addition, planning permission and an EIA is now required for &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; forestry (afforestation within 500 metres of existing forestry by the same developer in a three year period) where the 70 hectare threshold would be exceeded. <Col N="792" /></P>

      <P>Park constables in my Department, of whom there are seven employed in St. Stephen's Green and none in the Phoenix Park, are general operatives and as such are paid according to the basic general operative scale for Dublin &mdash; £193.50 to £205.90 over 11.5 years.</P>
      <P>In addition they are entitled to receive a travel allowance equivalent to one hour's pay, and an eating on site allowance of £1.13 for each day at work.  They work a 39 hour week averaged over 12 months.  They are paid an additional £5.86 for each Saturday worked and are paid at double time for hours worked on Sundays.  Their employment is pensionable and they qualify for paid sick leave &mdash; up to 13 weeks in any period of 12 months &mdash; and for three weeks and three days holidays per annum &mdash; their holiday entitlement is at present under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no direct pay relationship between general operatives employed by my Department and those employed by local authorities.  Park constables, in line with other public service workers, have their pay adjusted in accordance with national pay agreements.  Negotiations are taking place at present on a special pay increase <Col N="794" /> under clause 3 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The previous special pay increase was paid with effect from 1 January 1993.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are currently in place whereby the Garda authorities undertake pre-employment screening of candidates for employment in children's residential centres or other areas of the health service where the candidate would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals.  There are no charges associated with these existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>In order to guard against undesirable persons participating in community employment schemes, my Department together with the Garda authorities are at an advanced stage of discussion with FÁS, so as to extend these arrangements to employees having substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals on non-residential community employment schemes.  Proposals for a pilot project are currently being prepared and will be implemented shortly.  While the resources required for this additional work may be substantial I do not envisage that a fee will be payable by community employment groups.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of last year.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all Members of the House would agree that we need to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.  I have also indicated to the House that I was keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.  It remains the case that prison accommodation is not yet adequate to bring the provisions of the Bail Act generally into force at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, section 10 of the Act has already been brought into operation with effect from 2 June 1998.  That section amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
      <P>As to other provisions of the Act, I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing them into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the current strength of Ballycastle Garda station as of 31 May 1998, is one garda who resides in Ballycastle village.  They add that no member of sergeant rank has been attached to Ballycastle since 1985 when the previous incumbent transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the present policing arrangements in place in the Ballycastle area are adequate to meet its needs.  They further inform me that there are no plans at present to allocate a sergeant to Ballycastle.  However, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the situation will be kept under review and that when additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of the Ballycastle sub-district will be fully considered in the context of the needs of other Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The abuse of drugs within the prison system is largely confined to the committal institutions in the Dublin area.  As the State's main committal prison, Mountjoy, has a large daily throughput of prisoners, many of whom have long histories of drug abuse which they try to maintain while in custody.  Most of the other prison institutions are relatively drug free.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of illegal drugs in the prisons.  These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing.  It has been my policy to continue with these efforts to reduce the level of drugs in the prison system.</P>
      <P>Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own.  The education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders is important and to this end there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.</P>
      <P>Extensive treatment facilities are in place in Mountjoy prison to address the drug abuse problem there.  During 1997, approximately 1,650 inmates benefited from the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme operated under medical supervision in the prison.  In addition, about 130 inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit which opened in Mountjoy prison in July 1996.  This facility provides chemical detoxification and a therapy programme and is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State. It is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to both the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual inmates who have the motivation to deal with their addiction. I accept that more work is needed to extend the range of drug treatment facilities in the prison system and my Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expansion of drug treatment options generally.  Progress in this respect is constrained for the present by the serious limitations imposed by overcrowding in our committal prisons.  This constraint will be greatly lessened as the prison building programme proceeds.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the registrar of titles that, having regard to the volume of cases awaiting attention in the Land Registry, it is the policy to accord priority to dealings where registration is effected only on completion of the dealing. I am further informed that Land Commission vesting orders and schedules are deemed to be registered as of the date of vesting which is prior to the date of lodgment of the documents in the Land Registry.  Accordingly, registration in the Land Registry of Land Commission cases is afforded a lower priority than the registration of other dealings.</P>
      <P>Where a specific need arises which requires that such registration be effected, e.g., a further transaction affecting the land in question, the Land Registry processes the Land Commission case without delay.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will investigate the provision of a mast at the Garda station, Dominic Street, Kilkenny, to determine if the proposal is in breach of the guidelines and criteria in view of the fact that the mast location is adjacent to a large housing estate and school; the number of users the proposed mast can facilitate; his views on whether this proposal will seriously affect the value of property in the area and is a serious health risk to students and residents; if he will insist on withdrawing the application in view of the circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to <Col N="814" /> this matter is that Esat Digifone, the second mobile phone operator, approached the Garda Síochána with a proposal to co-locate their equipment on certain Garda radio masts or sites.  The Garda station at Dominic Street was included on the list of sites of interest to the company.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the desire to avoid a proliferation of such masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators, as recommended in the Department of the Environment Guidelines for Planning Authorities concerning Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to the company complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will therefore appreciate that careful and detailed consideration was given to the company's proposal and that the agreement with the company is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment.  Should any doubt arise in this regard it would be a matter for the relevant planning authority and the office of the director of telecommunications regulation to consider.  In this regard, I understand that the proposed development at Dominic Street will require planning permission.  Therefore, residents in the area will have the opportunity to voice their objections to the relevant planning authority at the appropriate time.  Under the terms of the contract with Digifone, except for a contravention by them of any of the conditions mentioned above, I am not at liberty to refuse them access.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the person to whom the Deputy refers but it is long standing practice not to comment in detail on the case of an individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception to that practice in this instance.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary or early release is a feature of prisons systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  The positive and negative reasons for the system have been well debated in this House before.  Prisonsers are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons and for periods ranging from a few hours to full temporary release or early release. Temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each case of early release is considered on the basis of the views of the governor of the institution in which the offender is imprisoned, the Garda Síochána and, if relevant, any recommendations of the Sentence Review Group, taking into <Col N="816" /> consideration such matters as any threat to the community which might arise, the nature of the offence, the offender's behaviour while the custody and any compassionate grounds whicih might merit special consideration.</P>

      <P>It is not entirely clear from the Deputy's question what is being referred to here.  For the purpose of my reply, I am assuming that she is referring to the process of evaluating tenders received for the provision of an independent legal service for applicants for refugee status and awarding a contract on foot of such evaluation.</P>
      <P>The evaluation of tenders and the awarding of a contract is carried out in full accordance with the procedures in place for such matters.</P>

      <Quest>the provisions, if any, being made by his Department to track Dublin Convention transfers to another member state to ensure that there is no indirect refoulment of these persons which would constitute a breach of Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention.</Quest>

      <P>While no provision has been made by my Department to track Dublin Convention transfers in another member state, section 22(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996, provides that a transfer under the terms of the Dublin Convention shall not take place unless the receiving country has agreed to accept responsibility for the examination of the application in question.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the Convention's starting point is that it guarantees the member states' commitment to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention which specifically provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
      <P>An underlying philosophy of the Dublin Convention is a basic confidence on the part of the member states in each other's procedures in relation to asylum law.  The establishment of responsibility for examining applications for asylum implicitly presupposes that member states have mutual confidence in each other as one member state consents to an application for asylum lodged with it being processed by another member state in accordance with the latter's national legislation.</P>

      <P>Currently there is no such <Col N="821" /> scheme in place.  However, as I have pointed out to this House on a number of occasions my Department has sought tenders from persons interested in establishing and maintaining an independent refugee legal service.  Such a service will provide free legal advice and representation for asylum seekers in connection with their asylum applications.  Five tenders were received and are currently being evaluated by officials of my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the UNHCR.</P>

      <P>A seminar for interpreters took place in my Department in late 1997 which outlined the role of the interpreter/translator and highlighted the sensitive and confidential nature of dealing with asylum applicant.  The function of the interpreter is to translate that which the applicants outlines to the interviewer.  Interpreters are aware of their role, i.e. an interpreter is a conduit of information without being participative.  In so far as interpreters are concerned, I would advice the Deputy that I am satisfied with the interpretation facilities currently provided.  This said, this was one of the issues examined by an interdepartmental committee which reported in 1996 on &ldquo;guidelines for the reception of asylum applicants&rdquo;. The committee recommended that a panel of qualified interpreters be drawn up and that they be trained, in conjunction with the UNHCR, in the asylum process.  This issue has been taken <Col N="823" /> up with the UNHCR and with the interpreters currently providing interpretation services for the Department.  This is a matter which is receiving urgent attention in the context of the many developments in the asylum area of my Department. All staff working in the asylum division, including my reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; experience of interviews and assessments.  The training programmes were agreed with UNHCR and delivered by a combination of my Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full time official here.  This training included the procedures to be followed when dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence.  Furthermore, some officials of my Department dealing with asylum matters have attended workshops run by the refugee studies programme at the University of Oxford in matters relating to refugee issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 417, 419 and 425 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the youth and sport grant scheme was transferred to my Department from the Department of Education and Science in July 1997 and notification of final allocations last year issued to committees in the final quarter of 1997.</P>
      <P>In common with other sports programmes funded by my Department, this scheme is being reviewed in the light of a number of developments in progress at the moment including, in particular, preparations for the establishment of a statutory sports council, to ensure that expenditure is in line with current sports and recreation policy.</P>
      <P>My particular concern is to ensure that Government funding for sport and recreation is well-focused, that unnecessary duplication is avoided, that arrangements are in place to ensure that expenditure is efficient and well co-ordinated and, where the VEC programmes are concerned, that the needs of the most deserving and vulnerable sectors of society are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to funding for 1998, my Department wrote to the vocational education committees inviting proposals for funding under the scheme, having regard to the government priority to target programmes towards areas of social and economic <Col N="825" /> disadvantage, and children and young people who are marginalised and at risk.  These proposals have been received and are being considered in the context of the Department's review of the scheme.  I hope to be in a position to finalise allocations to the vocational education committees for 1998 shortly.</P>

      <P>Matters relating to coaching are the responsibility of the respective national governing bodies of sport.  The National Coaching and Training Centre (NCTC), which assists bodies in raising the standard of coaching and training of coaches, operates a national coaching development programme in partnership with 52 national governing bodies.  I understand from NCTC that the programme does not recommend the use of hypnosis as a coaching method.</P>

      <P>In any future consideration of funding, I shall be taking on board Dr. Murphy's recommendation that increased public funding for necessary reorganisation and training be allocated through the sports council to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA).

      <P>As the Deputy will know, the £30 million young people's facilities and services fund is designed to provide facilities and services for young people in areas where a serious drug problem exists, or has the potential to develop.  £20 million of the fund is being targeted at the 13 local drugs task force areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the fund, development groups have been established in the target areas to prepare <Col N="828" /> integrated plans to address the needs of young people in those areas.  Recently the Irish Youth Foundation launched an initiative &ldquo;Companies Caring for Children&rdquo;, also designed to tackle problems faced by young people in areas of disadvantage. The youth foundation will work with the development groups, in selected areas, and with the assessment committee for the young people's facilities and services fund, to help the foundation identify how their contribution can have maximum impact and complement the fund.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Companies Caring for Children&rdquo; will focus initially on the four areas being targeted under the Integrated Services Pilot Project, i.e.: Dublin North East Inner City, The Canal Communities, Jobstown in Tallaght, Togher in Cork.</P>
    <P>To launch the &ldquo;Companies Caring for Children&rdquo; project, the chairman of the Irish Youth Foundation, Mr. Bill Cullen, has committed £250,000 over the next five years on behalf of his company, Renault Ireland.  He and deputy chairman, Tony O'Reilly Jr. have set a target of raising £1 million a year through the initiative.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this initiative by companies to join with the Government in addressing the needs of young people at risk of drug abuse and I look forward to further significant contributions from the corporate sector in this regard.</P>

      <P>The results of standardised tests which were recently submitted by schools applying for a remedial teaching service are being used by my Department's inspectorate to assist in assessing the relative needs of schools for a remedial teaching service.  Standardised tests assist in the identification of those pupils who are performing at a level below that expected for their chronological age.  They do not identify the reasons for the level of performance.  For this reason, the results of standardised tests are not used in the selection of schools for a resource teacher post.  These posts are allocated on the basis of the number of pupils with assessed disabilities attending the school or clusters of schools and the special circumstances of schools.  Such assessed disabilities include mental handicap, sensory impairment, physical disabilities and pupils who are emotionally disturbed.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.

      <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the development of significant new administrative arrangements.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise, I can assure the Deputies that they will be made and they will fully meet our commitments.  I expect to be in a position to announce further details on the administration of the scheme in the near future.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to abolish the local contribution, but since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. Therefore, since I have this year increased the standard rate of capitation grant to £50 per pupil, the local contribution now amounts to only 20 per cent of the State grant.</P>
      <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millenium, I will continue to give a clear priority to primary education, and will be seeking further improvements in the level of the capitation grant as resources allow.</P>

      <P>The trustees of the Ballycastle secondary school announced, on 1 October 1997, that the school would be phased out over a two year period commencing in 1998.  There would be no intake of new pupils in September 1998 and the school would close in the year 2000.  The reasons given for closure were the low enrolment in the school and the major financial burden in sustaining it.  The intention was that the pupils who would normally have enrolled in the school, would be accommodated in Lacken Cross Vocational School, in the future.</P>
      <P>I met with a deputation representing the parents of pupils at the school on 14 January last. The deputation stated that they intended to establish a management structure and hoped to rent the existing school building with a view to continuing the secondary school.  I indicated to the deputation that, as soon as they could confirm the availability of the building and the setting up of the necessary management structures, I would urgently consider their application.</P>
      <P>My Department has not, to date, received confirmation regarding the availability of the school building and establishment of management structures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 472 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputies refer.  My Department's inspectorate is actively engaged in seeking to arrange a suitable educational <Col N="839" /> placement for the child in question.  I am hopeful that the necessary arrangements will be put in place shortly.</P>
    <P>Children with autism have access to a variety of special support services.  The precise nature of the support provided depends on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
    <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism can be educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in special schools, including schools catering for children with mild mental handicap and schools for children with emotional or behavioural disorders.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in the establishment of a number of special classes which will be dedicated specifically to the needs of children with autism.  I am hopeful that the needs of the child in question will be accommodated in this context.</P>

      <P>Education about drugs has been included in the primary school curriculum as part <Col N="840" /> of health education and will be included within social, personal and health education in the revised curriculum for primary schools.  In order to support primary schools and teachers in implementing a developmental programme on drugs, my Department has prepared a detailed package of educational resource materials on substance misuse prevention education which was pilot tested in a small group of primary schools during the school year 1996-97.  It has been disseminated during 1997-98 to primary schools in priority areas where there is a known problem of substance misuse and is being revised during this summer in readiness for dissemination to primary schools generally as a support for the introduction of social personal and health education within the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>In-career development courses for primary teachers on the use of the educational resource materials have been developed as part of the overall support programme.  These have been provided during the school year just ended.  During the general dissemination of the educational resource materials, in support of the introduction of the revised primary school curriculum, incareer development courses for teachers generally will be provided.  In post-primary schools, education about drugs has been provided in specific subject areas such as biology, home-economics, physical education and religious education. An increasing number of post-primary schools have begun to provide education about drugs in the context of health education.  A package of educational resource materials for post-primary schools on substance misuse prevention education was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. These materials have been disseminated to post-primary schools generally over the past three years and this has given an impetus to the introduction of general health education programmes in these schools.</P>
      <P>In-career development courses for post-primary teachers on the use of these resource materials have been held each year since 1995 and up to 1,300 teachers have attended to date. It is intended to continue this training next year.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting a report from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the near future on the introduction of social, personal and health education to the core curriculum in post-primary schools.  This subject will include education on substance misuse prevention.  The supporting educational resource materials and the incareer courses for teachers will be revised in the light of the recommendations of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>

      <P>An establishment board has been appointed to complete strategic planning for a new institute of technology in Blanchardstown and to make arrangements for the commencement of courses.  The board, assisted by a number of officers of my Department who have been assigned to support it, has made considerable progress in the development of strategic and operational plans.</P>
      <P>A site for the new campus has been identified. This is part of a parcel of land to be developed as a Business and Technology Park by the IDA and Fingal County Council.  Proposals for the infrastructural development and landscaping of the site are at an advanced stage.  It is the intention that the first phase of the development of the new purpose-built campus will provide for 900 student places.</P>
      <P>Plans being developed by the board envisage the commencement of full-time third-level courses in the institute in September 1999 with a number of national certificate and <i>ab initio</i> national diploma courses being offered in the areas of computing and information technology, electronics and computer engineering, mechatronics, business studies and business IT and languages. As the institute would necessarily begin with first-year students, the build-up to the full complement of 900 full-time student places under phase 1 of the purpose-built campus development would take place gradually over a number of years.  The initial intake and the rate of build-up to full capacity depends on a number of factors, such as the approval of courses by the NCEA.</P>

      <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus will be introduced into schools in September 1999 and will be examined for the first time in June 2001.  A list of prescribed texts for the first course has already issued to schools.  This list draws on an extensive pool of poets specifically prepared for the syllabus by the leaving certificate English syllabus committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, following <Col N="847" /> wide consultation with the representative bodies.  The pool includes many Irish poets such as Séamus Heaney, Eavan Boland, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanain, Paul Durcan, Michael Hartnett and John Montague.  The pool also includes W.B. Yeats and Patrick Kavanagh who featured on leaving certificate courses since the late 1960s. This wider range of poets will give added vibrancy, vitality and immediacy to what is already being studied at senior cycle in secondary schools.</P>
      <P>While Patrick Kavanagh is not on the prescribed course for examination in 2001, he may be included in courses for any subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The 1998 third level student support schemes have recently been issued to local authorities and vocational education committees.  It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with <Col N="851" /> movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-9 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.  This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. The Deputy will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing needs generally in the education sector.  As I have said before I have identified the creation of additional third level places as my priority at third level.  I have also given a commitment to introduce maintenance grants for post leaving certificate students. Details of this new scheme will be available shortly.</P>

      <Quest>whether the registration fee for the 1998-99 academic year has been settled; if not, if he will set a deadline of 1 July 1998 to finalise it; if he has sought or received reports from colleges on the implementation of the framework of good practice to establish transparent expenditure of the fee on student services; and if he has satisfied himself with the operation of the system.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for <Col N="853" /> review for the 1997-98 academic year.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  I have not yet taken any decision about the charge for 1998-99 and I do not envisage doing so by 1 July.</P>
      <P>I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  As I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The Higher Education Authority issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions earlier this year.  This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards exams/registration and towards student services on an annual basis.  I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.  This review will shortly commence.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the valuable work carried out by the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities.  In 1997, my Department allocated a sum of £24,971 to the association towards the cost of their administration services and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools organised by the association for children from disadvantaged areas.  My Department is at present considering a request from the association for further funding in the current year.  I hope to be in a position to respond to the association shortly.  My Department is in ongoing contact with the association on matters of mutual concern and will continue to be available to meet representatives of the association where necessary.</P>

      <P>Permanent wholetime teacher appointments in the post-leaving certificate area are governed by the terms of circular letter 32/92.  This states that the following qualifications are acceptable for permanent appointments in the PLC area: first, degree or equivalent in subjects relevant to the course; second, degree and either an appropriate qualification in an area relevant to the course or three years' approved experience, including industrial and teaching experience, in <Col N="855" /> the appropriate area; or third, qualifications other than those mentioned which would be acceptable for posts in the colleges sector.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the agreement on teachers pay and conditions under the PCW, my Department is in the process of setting up a committee to determine suitable qualifications within the framework set out in CL 32/92 for appointment to permanent posts.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a school is determined by the enrolment in the school at 30 September of the preceding school year.  A teaching post at the school referred to by the Deputy will be lost at the end of the current school year because the enrolment at the school declined from 56 pupils in September 1996 to 49 pupils in September 1997.  The figure for the retention of the post is 55 pupils.  Unfortunately, in light of the overall enrolment decline at the school, I am not in a position to authorise the retention of the post at the school.</P>
