      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22 &mdash; statements on health.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 22, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of the Minister or the Minister of State and the main spokespersons for Fine Gael and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; statements of the main spokespersons for Democratic Left, the Green Party and each other Member called upon shall not exceed 10 minutes in each case; Members may share time.  Following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order No. 21, the Minister for Health and Children will take questions which will be brought to a conclusion not later than 4.45 p.m.</P>

      <P>Regarding possible legislation <Col N="2" /> on regionalisation, what would happen to the Government's application for Objective One status for particular areas if new statistics were produced on county income which differed from those on which the application was based?  Does any State agency produce figures on a sub-regional basis, at least for internal use?</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter for 30 minutes on the Order of Business yesterday. We also discussed it during Question Time and on the Adjournment.  I will allow a brief question from each of the party leaders on it.  If Deputies want to debate this matter they should use Private Members' time or other means.  We cannot have another prolonged discussion on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I understand that you have to implement the rules of the House and that we are restricted on the Order of Business to a limited set of queries.  However, at the end of the discussion yesterday I asked the Taoiseach if he would make Government time available for a debate now that we have Deputy Healy-Rae's formal proposal for 15 counties to be <Col N="3" /> submitted to Brussels.  I am asking the Taoiseach again if the Government will make time available to debate this matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with Jacques Santer today?  Concern is being expressed, particularly in Dublin, with regard to the Government's failure to achieve tax designation for the integrated area action plans, five of which are in Dublin, including Ballymun. These areas will suffer a double disadvantage as a result of the Government's decision on regionalisation which leaves them at a disadvantage in comparison to the rest of the country with regard to IDA grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a need for a separate debate to deal with the outstanding questions?  When he meets Jacques Santer, will he stress that GDP is not the only way of measuring quality of life and that we suffer badly on other indicators?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard figures mentioned this morning based on GDP at regional level featuring EUROSTAT calculations based on the official statistics of member states.  This is an annual exercise.  Peculiarly, these figures are published at the end of January.  The regional material is standardised using purchasing power parities.  It always has the effect of giving Ireland a far higher ranking than we would get using our own figures.  I would discount these figures.</P>

Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the outstanding legal matters in respect of the Refugee Act, 1996, have been settled and whether the Act will be fully implemented in the near future?

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the likely timeframe for the introduction of the administrative procedures Bill which will provide rights to private citizens in respect of information and access thereto?  In advance of the introduction of that legislation, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health and Children to publish the report on waiting lists?  For reasons no one understands, the Minister is suppressing the report.  It would be helpful if the report were made available to the participants in today's debate and not kept private, given that it was prepared at public expense and involves a matter of grave public concern.</P>

It is not acceptable that the House should debate an issue without having access to information, which is already in the Minister's possession, regarding a matter of critical importance.  People will suspect that the Minister has something to hide if he does not publish the report.  I advise the Taoiseach to ask him to publish it today.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Last July, banner newspaper headlines proclaimed that the gloves had come off in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's crackdown on white collar crime. At that stage we were informed that the fraud offences Bill was a priority and that it would be introduced in the near future.  It is proposed to introduce three Bills to deal with fraud, the criminal justice fraud offence Bill, the proceeds of crime Bill &mdash; which appears on the list of legislation to be published before Christmas &mdash; and the prevention of corruption Bill.  Will any of these Bills be published before Christmas?  Is white collar crime a priority on the Government's agenda?</P>

      <P>One of the Bills to which the <Col N="8" /> Deputy referred will be published prior to Christmas.  The criminal justice fraud offences Bill will be introduced in mid-1999.  A general scheme of the prevention of corruption Bill is in preparation at the Department which it is hoped will be circulated to other Departments during this month.  I cannot provide a date on which the legislation will be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue to which Deputy Sargent referred and for which he was unjustly thrown out of the House, namely, the fundraising for charitable and other purposes Bill. As Deputy Sargent tried to make clear, publication of the Bill has been put off on numerous occasions despite the fact that the Costello committee recommended its introduction.  There are suspicions charitable status has been granted to certain bodies to which it should not have been given.  This matter must be dealt with as soon as possible.  Can the Taoiseach give us a commitment here today that this will be given urgent priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is to reform the law in relation to the administration of the regulations, as the Deputy stated, along the lines of the Costello commission report.  Work on preparing the general scheme is proceeding in the Department as quickly as possible.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate as an opportunity to consider in a constructive way how the health services are being developed and how the main problems are being addressed.  The Government is very clear about what it is trying to achieve through the health services.  It has adopted and is seeking to implement the 1994 health strategy statement, as updated this year in my Department's statement of strategy.  It has also set out its specific priority objectives in the programme for Government and is making steady progress in achieving these.  Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, there is a clear and coherent programme in place for the improvement of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The Government has committed significant additional resources for the improvement of health services in areas of greatest need and I shall be describing these in more detail later.  It is devoting more resources to the non-capital and capital areas; the latter has enjoyed a significant increase and further large increases can be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Planning, management and control are essential in implementing the longer-term strategy. The Government will use the 1996 legislation to control non-capital expenditure within the limits agreed by Government and approved by the Dáil. It will ensure that available resources are distributed as objectively as possible, consistent with real needs, and it will not allow the agenda to be dominated by those who are best placed to make the loudest noises about their needs.  It is not an unplanned or rudderless service.  It is far better integrated than many health systems and is acknowledged by the OECD as an efficient, well organised service.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statements made by the Opposition last week and yesterday in the Dáil on the infamous £32 million, I do not intend to return to this matter in any great detail.  For the record I will say one more time, there is no reduction in spending on the health services this year.  There is an increase in overall expenditure.  The allocations to the agencies have not been reduced and will be increased by the Supplementary Estimate when it is taken soon.  The Opposition appears to be demanding that I effectively ignore the accountability legislation which it brought before the House two years ago.  I can only say that its principles were quickly overturned by the first real choice it had to make as an Opposition in supporting its own legislation.  It should know &mdash; I have no doubt it does &mdash; that the health services must have genuine planning for the future and that playing politics will destroy the foundations of accountability, planning and management set down by the legislation of 1996.</P>
    <P>This Government has, since it took office, shown its determination to invest in the health services so that key areas will benefit from the continuing and welcome growth in the economy. The Health Vote has increased by over 9 per cent this year over the outturn for 1997.  The increase for 1999 over the expected outturn for 1998 will represent a figure of 9.5 per cent.  Given the Government's commitment to holding public expenditure at an average increase of 4 per cent per annum, it can be seen that the Government is funding the health services as a top priority.</P>
    <P>In regard to capital, I have negotiated a three year programme.  This is the first time any Minister for Health has been in a position to work with such assurance in relation to capital developments. This will be of immense benefit to the system as my Department and the agencies can plan on a much more orderly basis.  The actual amounts for each year of that programme are: £147 million in 1998, £155 million in 1999 and £165 million in 2000.  Over that three year period <Col N="11" /> the total amount of extra investment over the original 1997 figure of £108 million will be a total of £143 million.  Indeed, the figure for the year 2000 represents an increase of 53 per cent over the 1997 original figure introduced to the Oireachtas by former Minister Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>All of this reflects the Government's recognition that the health capital programme has not been adequately resourced in the past.  The 1999 letters of determination from my Department to the agencies will set out budgets for the replacement of priority equipment, maintenance backlogs and fire precaution works, and it is my intention to continue this process in the years ahead so that the agencies will be in a position to plan for the medium term in regard to better maintaining their infrastructure.  It has been a matter of great satisfaction to me that I have been able to greatly increase the capital investment in services for the mentally handicapped, the elderly and those requiring psychiatric care.  I am confident that I will, in due course, be able to announce for 2001 a further greatly enhanced level of funding for capital.</P>
    <P>The acute hospital sector consumes about 50 per cent of total expenditure.  This sector is getting its fair share of resources having regard to the need to meet other priorities, many of which have been relatively neglected until recent years. The hospital system continues to expand with more patients being treated every year.  This year alone has seen an increase of 9 per cent in day work with a 1 per cent growth in in-patient activity and with an overall average increase of over 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>While the acute hospital sector continues to receive the largest single share of the funding devoted to the health service, the benefits of this funding are clear.  In recent years, the acute hospital system has treated a steadily increasing number of patients.  A recent study by the OECD has shown that the Irish hospital system has become more productive and efficient.  The average length of a hospital stay has declined.  Better management of hospitals has resulted in increased occupancy levels.  Hospitals have taken advantage of developments in medical practice to increase the level of day care in Irish hospitals almost four-fold since 1986.  The impact of these improvements can be seen in the fact that the number of patients treated in acute hospitals has risen by 3 per cent a year since 1987.  In the 12 months to the end of August 1998, 539,900 patients had been discharged from our acute hospitals, almost 17,000 more than in the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The continuing improvement in output in the acute hospital sector is underpinned by a commitment by this Government to provide additional funding, facilities, equipment and staff to the acute hospitals. In this year alone, the Government has provided an additional £44 million to improve acute hospital services.  As a result of this funding, new <Col N="12" /> hospital developments are being brought onstream, including those at Temple Street children's hospital, Longford-Westmeath General Hospital and the Mercy Hospital in Cork. Additional medical and nursing staff are being employed to improve services for patients in important areas such as the accident and emergency service.  The cancer strategy provides for the appointment of additional consultants in the specialties of oncology, haematology and palliative care and the development of services for cancer patients in regions where the need for such services has been clear for a long time.  The funding and services which have been put in place this year have gone some way to addressing the problems in acute hospitals which the Government faced on coming into office.  The recently published Estimates for 1999 again provide evidence of our concern to provide for the development of the health services.  I will continue to work throughout 1999 to further improve the acute hospital service.</P>
    <P>I announced yesterday an increase in charges for private rooms in public hospitals.  Let me make it absolutely clear again that I have no apologies to make for this increase.  The increase still leaves a gap between the charges and the cost of providing services to private patients in public hospitals.  As Minister for Health and Children, am I expected to allow these charges to be frozen and thereby continue with subsidies for private practice or should those charges not reflect the realistic cost of providing services?  There are already considerable subsidies in place for the private sector, including tax breaks, and I will not allow a situation to continue whereby the taxpayer must pick up an ever increasing proportion of hospital costs while the private sector does not meet its fair share.</P>
    <P>The total amount earned by the State from private patients in 1997, in respect of private accommodation in public hospitals, is estimated at about £68 million.  It is also estimated that the cost to the Exchequer in 1997-98 was £64.5 million in respect of income tax relief on private health insurance premiums and about £20 million in respect of unreimbursed medical expenses. There is massive investment in public hospitals by the Exchequer, including building, equipment and staff training.  Public hospitals also provide the accident and emergency services.  Health insurance companies avail of these facilities and they must make a contribution towards those services. There are many reasons for cost increases for insurance premia, including the charges made by private hospitals and medical consultants.  It is estimated that the last increase of 9 per cent in January 1998 in private accommodation charges contributed only 2 per cent of the 9 per cent increase in private health insurance premia introduced by VHI in September 1998.</P>
    <P>On taking up office as Minister for Health and Children, one of the priorities I set was to tackle the problem of unduly long waiting lists and waiting times, as pledged by the Government in An <Col N="13" /> Action Programme for the Millennium.  I immediately examined the situation and saw the need for organisational changes in the way the waiting list initiative was being implemented.  I took a number of initiatives in 1997 aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the waiting list investment.  These were the much earlier notification to each hospital of the level of funding to be made available to them under the waiting list initiative &mdash; hospitals received details of their waiting lists funding in December 1997, whereas in previous years the funding for waiting lists tended not to be allocated until around July; an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, so that we would not lose sight of our major concern &mdash; that is to reduce the length of time patients must await treatment on a public waiting list.</P>
    <P>As regards the waiting list initiative, I allocated £12 million for waiting list work this year, which represents an increase of 50 per cent over the funding made available by the previous Government in 1997.  The additional funding will result in an extra 15,000 procedures being carried out during the current year.  I took these initiatives against the background of a significant increase in waiting lists during the period 1995 to 1997.</P>
    <P>When the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government took office in December 1994, waiting lists stood at 24,000.  When that Government left office in June 1997 waiting lists had increased to over 30,000.  They rose to 32,000 by December 1997 due in part to the allocation by that Government of just £8 million for waiting list work in 1997.  This represents an increase of 33.3 per cent during the lifetime of the previous Government. With the reduced funding provided by the rainbow Government waiting lists rose by one-third. This suggests that for the foreseeable future we need more significant funding to address the problem of waiting lists and waiting times and I am addressing the question of additional funding requirements as part of the budget process for 1999.</P>
    <P>I caution against adopting a simplistic approach to dealing with unduly long waiting lists and waiting times.  Ireland is not unique in having long waiting lists and waiting times for acute hospital procedures.  They are a problem for the health services in many countries and no country has yet managed to wipe them out or to have them reduced very quickly.  The quick-fix solution of simply throwing money at the problem is not the answer.  What is required is a structured, co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary approach to dealing with waiting lists and times.  Fundamental to this is the establishment of the underlying causes of unduly long waiting lists and waiting times. Towards establishing these causes and, by extension, a strategy to deal with them in a planned way, I established the expert review group in April 1998 to look at the problem.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group sets out a logical and structured means of addressing waiting lists and waiting times.  It has recommended that <Col N="14" /> efficient and effective action to tackle waiting lists and waiting times will require developments at each level of the health care system, in particular in relation to care of the elderly.  By their very nature, the measures recommended by the review group will take time to put in place to yield their full potential.</P>
    <P>As a first step, I am making the organisational arrangements necessary to ensure a structured and planned programme to deal with the waiting lists and waiting times is implemented in each acute hospital as a matter of urgency.  In addition to increasing the number of elective procedures during 1999 and achieving an overall reduction in waiting lists and waiting times, I will be putting in place arrangements necessary to manage the waiting list initiative, at national and hospital level, in a more efficient, effective and consistent manner than heretofore.  This will involve shared responsibility between management and consultants for the management of waiting lists in a manner which respects the relative roles and responsibilities of both and which has, as its ultimate objective, the implementation of waiting list programmes in each acute hospital, where every person who requires an inpatient surgical procedure receives that procedure within the target times specified.</P>
    <P>There has been much recent debate and criticism about the levels of funding for services for persons with a mental handicap.  I am pleased to have another opportunity to reiterate my record in this area.  Since my appointment as Minister and despite the many competing demands on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my top priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001.  In the past 12 months or so, I have allocated an additional £25 million to these services.  This is more than double the additional funding allocated by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have also put in place a £30 million national capital programme, to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need, to provide the infrastructure necessary to support these services. This is the first time such a programme has been provided and it allows for multi-annual planning in developing services.</P>
    <P>My recent announcement of a £13 million capital project for St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, funded jointly by my Department and the Eastern Health Board, is of particular satisfaction to me.  I am proud to be part of a Government that is not only the first to fully appreciate the need for this development but is also providing the necessary funding to ensure this development becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>The level of additional funding provided to date has given clear and concrete evidence of this Government's commitment to meeting the needs identified in the assessment of need.  This commitment, together with the multi-annual budgeting <Col N="15" /> framework, will facilitate a significant development of services for those with a mental handicap in a well-planned and orderly way.  This will represent a huge improvement on the <i>ad hoc</i>&ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; approach to such development in the past.  I have clearly demonstrated my commitment and that of the Government to meeting the identified needs in this area and this will remain a top priority.</P>
    <P>The rights of our older citizens to appropriate support in their homes and easily accessible services, when these are required, is also a major issue which needs to be addressed.  The need for action is clear from the demographic changes taking place, which will result in significant increases in the number of older people over the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People, in a recent report, highlighted a number of key service areas which need urgent attention. These include the home help service, respite care, support for carers, day care, paramedical services, social work services and services for older people with mental health problems.  Having examined the report and discussed the issues with various groups who represent the interests of older people, it is clear the greatest need lies in the provision of better community-based services, particularly care in the home, including support for family carers.</P>
    <P>In 1998, we provided an additional £7 million to provide new services for older people and to improve existing services such as specialist departments of medicine of old age attached to general hospitals, together with community nursing units which provide a wide range of services for older people, including respite and day care, day hospitals and day centres.  The additional money has also allowed staffing in existing extended care hospitals and in the community services to be improved.  An additional £1 million has been provided this year to develop a specialist mental health service for older people, while over £6.5 million was provided in late 1997 to enable health boards to provide greater support to older people in private nursing homes.  On the capital side, I have more than doubled the level of capital resources previously made available for health facilities for older people by bringing that figure to £14 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The areas of child care and food safety are key priorities on the Government's agenda.  The importance of these areas was underlined with the appointment of Ministers of State, Deputy Moffatt and Deputy Fahey, to take day to day responsibility for making progress on the Government programme.  Both Ministers of State will speak later in the debate and outline developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>I have set out some of the key policies receiving attention at national level.  However, for those policies to impact at ground level they must be built upon by local management.  The health strategy and the accountability legislation have placed <Col N="16" /> a key emphasis on the delegation of authority to local levels.  In return for such delegation, it is reasonable to expect that best practice should apply uniformly across agencies.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the key tasks of governance and management and set out the level of performance I want to see achieved throughout our services. Everyone accepts that health management is a complex and difficult task.  It has perhaps been the focus of most public debate in the acute hospital sector.  One area which has received insufficient attention to date is that of governance. No manager, however skilled and well supported by clinicians, can deliver appropriate and effective services without clear directions from his or her board.  There is an absolute need for every health agency to be explicit about the values and principles which underpin the service it delivers and by which it will measure itself and those it employs.</P>
    <P>The accountability legislation brought a sharper focus than ever before to the issue of governance as it now affects health board members and management.  This year my Department has embarked on a general programme of governance development with a number of the major voluntary hospitals.  This is long haul work but I am certain it will be a vital part of our future success and our continuing ability to deliver quality services within defined budgets.</P>
    <P>As we all know from managing our personal finances, budgeting is not easy but it must be done.  A failure to live within one's means may be possible for a short period, provided the degree of deviation is modest.  However, this cannot be sustained for long without serious consequences.</P>
    <P>The managers of health service agencies must also live within their budgets.  I accept that the management of acute hospital services poses significant and difficult challenges.  The activities to be managed are largescale and complex.  The acute demands that may be made on the system are unpredictable.  However, none of these demands are new.  We have been here before and we have managed these problems.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of predictability in what faces each acute hospital every year.  The surge in demand for acute services in January and February of each year is a well observed phenomenon. The drop off in demand for elective services in the summer is also well known.  The fact that facilities have to be taken out of commission for maintenance or refurbishing is known.  At the beginning of each year it should be possible to devise a plan which matches known available resources to these demands.  However, a plan drawn up in December or January cannot simply be put on a wall or a shelf and left there to gather dust.</P>
    <P>What is the role of clinicians in this process?</P>
    <P>We know that clinical decisions and clinical activity drives the vast bulk of spending in the acute hospital sector.  We also know and appreciate that expenditure driven decisions have clinical implications.  It is, therefore, obvious that clinicians <Col N="17" /> should be involved in the management process in our hospitals.  They already are in many hospitals and I will launch an initiative on 27 November to roll this process out to the entire hospital system.  I do not claim now, and I will not claim then, that this alone is an answer to some of the difficulties we have seen in recent weeks. The process of implementing this will not be easy and it will pose major challenges to doctors and managers.  It will not lead to easier decisions, but it should lead to better ones.</P>
    <P>There is a need for partnership in the health services.  This partnership lies not just in delivering services but in working together to resolve problems.  Two of the most pressing problems requiring attention are medical and nursing manpower.  Frameworks are in place for both but if partnership is to work, it cannot work on the basis of Department or management proposing solutions which are then examined or criticised, perhaps rejected, because they represent a change in how things get done, even if doing them differently would represent a better deal for the patient.</P>
    <P>We must put the patient at the centre of the system, even if that means changing the type of contracts people have, the hours they are required to cover, the ways in which they interact with other service providers and the processes through which work is done.  Those responsible for governance must assure themselves that the service is good and safe and is seen as such by the patient.  Management must provide the environment and the infrastructure through which people are likely to give of their best, as well as complying with their statutory obligations and those delivering the service must show flexibility and responsiveness in a dynamic and necessarily rapidly changing service.</P>
    <P>Whether in governance, management or delivery, in every part of the service, we must identify and spread best practice.  Whether one is receiving or seeking a service in Donegal, Dublin or Kerry, the response should be equally good.  I am making this a matter of the utmost priority and I will return to this theme regularly in my discussions and contacts with all parts of the service.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its attention and invite Deputies who may wish to do so to contribute to this debate.  I will try to respond comprehensively and constructively either today or subsequently in writing.</P>
    <P>I have tried to set out the principles which I, as Minister for Health and Children, must work from and the performance we should work towards achieving throughout our health services. I have secured significant extra funding for hospital services, the mentally handicapped, the elderly and other services.  For 1999 the increase in the gross health vote will be about 9.5 per cent or £356 million.  This, by any standards, must be regarded as a large increase.  I have obtained significant extra resources for the capital programme for the hospital and non-hospital areas and ensured that the programme will be well <Col N="18" /> resourced over the 1998-2000 period.  I am confident I will soon be able to announce further significantly enhanced capital funding in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that this level of increased investment must be balanced by a commitment to govern and manage in a planned way through efficient and effective application of resources. There is a clear responsibility on all of us, whether in this House or involved in service provision outside, to ensure that the principles set out in the legislation two years ago are accepted by everyone and implemented.  I appreciate that Deputies are impatient to see early progress in a number of areas and I am equally anxious to advance as quickly as possible.  The overall strategy I have set out here builds on the work of previous Governments in the health strategy and the accountability legislation.  If the signals we send out to health agencies and the public are to be consistent, it is imperative that all sides of this House support this overall strategy.</P>

    <P>In the South-Eastern Health Board area as of June 1998, Cashel hospital had 59 patients on its waiting list and 25 beds will close in December, Kilkenny hospital had 535 patients on its waiting list and four beds will close in December, Waterford <Col N="19" /> hospital had 1,617 patients on its waiting list and 31 beds will close in December, and Wexford hospital had 335 patients on its waiting list and 32 beds will close in December.</P>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board area as of June 1998, Mercy Hospital, Cork had 701 patients on its waiting list and nine beds will close in December, South Victoria Hospital had 945 patients on its waiting list and 89 beds will close in December, Tralee hospital had 602 patients on its waiting list and 30 beds will close in December.</P>
    <P>In the Western Health Board area as of June 1998, University College Hospital, Galway had 2,891 patients on its waiting list and 58 beds will close in December, and Portinuncula Hospital had 53 patients on its waiting list and 36 beds will close in December.</P>
    <P>As of June 1998, there were 25,018 patients awaiting in-patient treatment and 912 beds will close in December.  Some 12 of those hospital beds will be closed for almost the entire month of December and the remainder will be closed for an average period of two weeks.  According to the Minister's figures yesterday, bed closures to date in 1998 have accounted for a total of 74,379 bed days nationally.  The total projected number of bed days associated with temporary bed closures for 1998 will be 90,398.  Consequently, in the remaining weeks of this year 16,019 bed days will be lost as a result of bed closures.</P>
    <P>We must have a more patient-centred medical service which puts patients first.  We must ensure equality of access for all to essential medical care and take the initiatives required to address the inadequacies in our public hospital service. Access to in-patient hospital treatment or surgery must occur within a reasonable designated time-frame for those who require it.  To achieve this, demographic and population changes, which economic prosperity has brought about, need to be reflected in our health policy and planning. Resources must be allocated, which guarantee a health service of a standard to which our people are entitled and of which we can be proud. Speedy access to essential health care should not be dependent on personal wealth.</P>
    <P>Over an 18 month period the Government has presided over one of the most dramatic increases in hospital waiting lists to have occurred in modern times.  By the end of June 1998 there were 34,331 patients on the public hospital waiting list. It is conservatively estimated this figure had grown to 36,500 by 30 September and it is reasonable to assume that by the end of the year it will have reached 38,500.  During the Minister's term of office the numbers on the waiting lists will have increased by 10,000.  That has occurred not in a time of economic difficulty but in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity never previously experienced in the State.  It has occurred at a time when Exchequer income has substantially surpassed the best expectations of the Minister <Col N="20" /> for Finance and his Department and in a year in which it is anticipated the national debt will be reduced by £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Incredibly our hospital waiting lists have spiralled in a year when the Department of Health and Children received, through health levy receipts, approximately £65 million in excess of the sum originally anticipated at the start of the year and in a year when, according to the Minister for Finance on Wednesday last week, savings of £32.5 million were expected in the outturn of the Department of Health and Children compared with the original estimated outturn in January 1998.</P>
    <P>Throughout the second half of this year hospitals throughout the State have been closing beds and wards for fear they would exceed their allocated budget.  Those bed closures have resulted in patients' appointments for elective surgery being cancelled and have contributed to the dramatic increase in hospital waiting lists. Last week I conservatively estimated that 800 beds would close in the month of December, but we now know the number to be 912, with an additional 16,000 bed days lost in the past six weeks of this year.  The loss of so many bed days will further add to the waiting lists and prolong the waiting time for essential surgery for thousands of people who require hospital admission. In December 1998 there will be a substantially scaled down public hospital service throughout the length and breadth of the country.  In the Ireland of 1998 one becomes ill at one's peril in the month of December.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate we are having this debate today as members of SIPTU and the Irish Nurses' Organisation are protesting against proposed bed closures at Tullamore General Hospital, which is the Minister's local hospital.  A total of 14 beds are due to close on 5 December for one month with the consequent loss of 1,240 bed days.  The Midland Health Board proposes to lay off 17 nurses and five non-nursing staff and essentially place the hospital on emergency status.  That hospital has a substantial public waiting list for ear, nose and throat procedures and for orthopaedic procedures, including hip and knee replacements.</P>
    <P>As at 30 June there were 559 adults and 533 children on the in-patient waiting list for ENT procedures, 580 patients awaiting orthopaedic care, 119 awaiting total hip replacement operations and 24 awaiting total knee replacement operations.  As at 30 June Tullamore General Hospital had in total 1,737 patients on its waiting list, an increase of almost 200 during the Minister's first year in office.  The Minister might tell the House if he intends to hold a public meeting in his constituency to explain why he believes it is acceptable that hospital beds will close in Tullamore General Hospital, that essential elective surgery will be further delayed and that his constituents will continue to suffer pain and ill-health.</P>

      <P>His obvious lack of concern is shown by the behaviour displayed on the opposite benches and the grins and laughs being exchanged between him and his junior Ministers.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Labour Relations Commission talks commenced in Galway on a dispute which has arisen over the threatened hospital ward and theatre closures in the University College Hospital, Galway.  It was reported this morning that those talks were unsuccessful in resolving the problem.  That hospital, which is in the backyard of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, proposes the closure in December of two wards and one theatre and the lay-off of 45 nurses.  A consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital, Mr. Jack McCann, has offered to loan the hospital half his salary for the month of December to facilitate keeping the theatre open.  Galway FM local radio has supported a public appeal for donations to provide the hospital with the additional funding it requires to avoid bed and theatre closures.</P>
      <P>In recent days the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who unjustifiably and viciously attacked the management of the Western Health Board and the management of the hospital for the current crisis, has gone strangely silent.  Mr. McCann estimated that if the closures can be avoided 400 more patients will receive essential treatment by the end of the year and instead of the waiting list at the hospital continuing to escalate it will be contained.  As of 30 June that hospital had 2,891 patients on its waiting list for in-patient care. Those included 130 cardiology patients, 484 adults and 179 children requiring ENT procedures, 682 adults requiring ophthalmology procedures, including 536 adults requiring cataract operations, and 539 requiring urological procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one in this State understands the need to close so many hospital beds and to lose thousands of hospital days at a time when the Department has benefited from an extra windfall of £65 million raised through the health levy, over half of which last week the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance intended should be withheld from the health service.  Those Ministers appear to be mentally locked into a 1980s budgetary time warp and incapable of coming to terms with the economic realities of this State and the health needs of our people as we enter a new millennium.  On Thursday last week the Minister and his officials stated that the existence of the unspent £32 million was illusory and that sum would be spent by the end of the year on demand-led services such as the free drugs scheme.  Confusion was deliberately sown and a political smokescreen created to cover up the <Col N="22" /> Minister's embarrassment and failure to use these moneys to keep hospital beds open and the embarrassment of his Department, which yet again presents itself as being incompetent and out of touch with the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>From the Estimates published it was clear that half of this additional sum of £65 million obtained on the health levy was to be used for such schemes and the remaining half, as of Wednesday night last week, was regarded by the Minister for Finance and stated by him to be retained by the Exchequer as part of the Government's savings in the year.  On Tuesday this week the Minister for Finance, to protect his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, added to the confusion. He stated the sum spent on health at the end of the year would exceed the sum originally estimated to be spent at the beginning of the year. In that he is correct.  In so far as the Department has been required to meet the additional expenditure over and above the sum originally envisaged in January, a portion of the windfall from the health levy was to be made available to the Department.  However, no portion of that money has been made available to acute hospitals to facilitate them to provide for the extra demands made on them for in-patient hospital care.  It remained the position until last night that £32.5 million of the health levy windfall was to be retained by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As a result of the embarrassment caused to the Government and the Minister for Health and Children, the new Health Supplementary Estimate has been circulated.  Contrary to what was contained in the Government's Estimates published one week ago, instead of envisaging a saving of £32.5 million on the end of the year health outturn, it now makes provision for a £5.5 million overrun.  Essentially, it provides for the expenditure of the £65 million windfall received through the health levy together with an additional Exchequer payment of £5.5 million.  Within one week of its publication, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children have undermined the credibility of the Government's published Estimates and have contrived a Supplementary Estimate designed to ensure that the Government cannot be accused of withholding available funds from the health services.</P>

      <P>Tragically none of the additional moneys provided for the Supplementary Estimate will impact on patient care or prevent unnecessary bed closures.  A large portion of this Supplementary Estimate is an accounting exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Approximately £30 million of the Supplementary Estimate being proposed by the Government is to top up superannuation and pension funds, issues that could easily have been addressed in next year's budget and issues which would have been concluded in the original published Estimates if the Government had intended to address them.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials in briefings in recent days referred, as the Minister did this morning, to the 1996 legislation passed by the pervious Government, which prevents health boards exceeding their budgets allocated at the beginning of the year and prevents them from raising overdrafts.  This legislation was rightly put in place to enable central Government to determine financial allocations for the health services and to prevent health boards arbitrarily running up overdrafts which they could not discharge out of their own resources.  The Minister and his officials talked of not rewarding health boards which had overspent by giving them extra resources raised by the health levy as this, they contend, would be an incentive for those who remained within their budget this year to over-spend next year in the expectation that they would be bailed out.  However, the Minister has at no time suggested that any of our health boards are operating inefficiently or misusing the funds allocated to them.</P>
    <P>In response to a Dáil question as recently as 3 November and again today, the Minister emphasised that overall acute hospital in-patient activity for the first six months of this year includes an increase of 1.1 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day activity was 9.7 per cent.  Hospitals have experienced a substantial increase in the number of patients requiring essential surgery and medical procedures.  That is partly due to changes in demographic and population patterns.  It is also due to the increasing sophistication of medical technology, unavailable years ago, which provides new procedures from which people may benefit. The health boards and hospitals are confronted by a need for medical treatment and surgery for real people whose lives in some cases are at risk and, in other cases, whose quality of life is substantially diminished by pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>The 1996 legislation does not act as a barrier to a Minister for Health providing additional financial allocations to hospitals forced to close beds in the month of December for budgetary reasons. It does not prevent the Minister in the middle of the year from reviewing the state of the hospital waiting lists and considering, in the context of unexpected financial inflows to his Department, whether additional funding should be made available to facilitate the undertaking of additional procedures at a time when waiting lists are growing. An efficient and competent Minister would have conducted such a review and would, given health levy buoyancy, have allocated additional <Col N="24" /> funds to tackle the waiting list crisis earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Five weeks ago in the Dáil and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I proposed a broad range of measures which are essential to tackle the in-patient and out-patient waiting lists in a systematic and practical way and to make our acute hospitals more patient centred.  In the Fine Gael policy document, Patients First, reference is also made to the need for new information systems and technology in the Department of Health and Children.  This is essential to enable the Department to have available to it up-to-date statistics and information to monitor and analyse the manner in which our medical service is functioning within each health board area and within each hospital.  It is a scandal that, in the second half of November 1998, neither the Minister nor his Department can make available complete and up-to-date data on the current state of the hospital waiting lists in the context of each hospital and each specialty.</P>
    <P>The Department collates quarterly figures but yesterday the Minister was unable to supply the waiting list figures as at 30 September 1998.  It appears the Department and the Minister are relying on figures collated in June 1998.  The Minister, therefore, is defending bed closures in December without knowing the full extent of the waiting list crisis by which he is confronted and having done nothing in his term of office to ensure that the data are collected and collated by his Department on an efficient and up-to-date basis so he will be in a position to act when unanticipated difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Minister has displayed extraordinary incompetence and lack of insight. While defending bed closures and refusing to make additional funds available to acute hospitals, on Monday this week in Waterford he admitted that the waiting lists had increased &mdash; without knowing the extent of the increase &mdash; and stated that next year additional funding would be made available to the waiting list initiative.  If additional funding is required next year, the Minister should explain his justification for closing beds in December and, by so doing, exacerbating the extent of the problem and adding to the suffering of those on the burgeoning lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be incapable of putting people first and regarding those on hospital waiting lists as people with real needs as opposed to mere statistics.  The slogan adopted for Fianna Fáil's forthcoming Árd Fheis, &ldquo;Partnership with People&rdquo;, rings hollow in the context of the December hospital bed closures and the escalating hospital waiting lists.  It deserves as little credibility as the election slogan which falsely promised additional health resources and was used by Fianna Fáil in its election campaign of 1987, &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reality is that major structural reforms, such as those proposed by Fine Gael in its document, Patients First, are required if we are to <Col N="25" /> resolve the problem posed by waiting lists and provide the type of modern, responsive medical service to which people are entitled.  It is also clear that additional resources must be provided for both capital and current expenditure.  It is the duty of Members of the House to ensure that no person resident in this State is deprived of speedy access to essential medical services owing to their inability to pay for such services.</P>
    <P>When discussing the allocation of State funding to the health service, we should also not lose sight of the fact that the State, which has the fastest growing economy in Europe, ranks among the lowest spending European Union countries on health care, according to a recent report on the Irish health system for the 21st century.  The report details that the only countries to spend a smaller proportion of GDP on health than Ireland's 7 per cent are the UK, Luxembourg and Greece.</P>
    <P>When the Government required additional funding to meet Garda pay and prison officers' overtime, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had no difficulty securing sanction from the Department of Finance for a Supplementary Estimate.  It makes a mockery of the Árd Fheis slogan &ldquo;Partnership with People&rdquo; that the Minister for Health and Children neither sought nor publicly expressed a wish to secure Department of Finance sanction for a Supplementary Estimate to provide additional funds to our acute hospitals to prevent unnecessary bed closures in December.</P>
    <P>The complacency of the Minister and the Government parties and their lack of commitment to the public health service is astounding. The closure of hospital beds in December, taken together with the escalating hospital waiting lists, has not stirred the consciences of the Progressive Democrat members of Government or attracted the interest of the Independents who support the Government.</P>
    <P>The indifference of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party was well described by a Fianna Fáil spokesperson who briefed <i>The Irish Times</i> on the parliamentary party meeting last week.  The newspaper reported the spokesperson as saying that there was surprisingly little clamour from members of the party for extra health funding. Presumably even the Minister was surprised at this.  Moreover, the party's chairman, Deputy O'Hanlon, on behalf of the party washed his hands of the issue saying &ldquo;the united view was that it does not seem to make any difference how much money goes into the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clearly, that party, which will pretend to the nation this coming weekend that it is in partnership with the people, does not care about the fears of those awaiting life saving cardiac surgery or the pain and suffering being experienced by the escalating number of adults and children on the in-patient hospital waiting lists, many of whom are waiting for up to two years for essential surgery.  The party's members also apparently do not care that the content of the report of the <Col N="26" /> review group on waiting lists, which has been on the Minister's desk since August, has been drip fed to journalists and concealed from Members of the House and that the Minister and his Department regard it as &ldquo;not in the public interest&rdquo; that it be published and made available for constructive debate.</P>
    <P>To date, the Fine Gael Party document, Patients First, is the only comprehensive document in the public domain which describes the measures necessary to tackle the waiting list crisis.  This Minister could make a start by allocating a portion of the health levy windfall to prevent hospital beds closing in the month of December.</P>
    <P>No major public hospital, such as University College Hospital, Galway, should be placed in a position in which it must publicly seek funding through a local radio station to keep beds and a theatre open.  Citizens are entitled, as of right, to an accessible in-patient public health service.  This Minister appears to be intent on bringing us back to the era of the workhouse, an era when the poorest sections of the community had no right to medical care and when such care was provided on a grace and favour basis.  Apparently in Galway it will be provided from charitable donations made through a local radio station.</P>

      <P>This debate takes place against a backdrop of soaring hospital waiting lists for a number of health services.  In addition, there are lengthy hidden waiting lists for all such services. I am referring to the people who are on waiting lists to get on to waiting lists, people who have been given out-patient appointments for 12 or 15 months hence and people who had such appointments but whose appointments have been cancelled. We are not only talking about the waiting list numbers which are already in the public domain but vast numbers of other people on hidden waiting lists for the health services.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to tackle the crisis in hospital waiting lists.  If there was a crisis in the waiting lists when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, was appointed to office in June 1996, what words can be used to describe the current situation?  The latest figures available show that over 34,000 people are awaiting treatment in hospital.  By the end of the year this number will have undoubtedly increased to almost 40,000.  At year end, it is likely that the Minister and the Government will have presided over an increase of 10,000 people on hospital waiting lists.</P>
      <P>These figures do not simply represent facts that can be thrown across the floor of this House. They represent real people in need of real treatment. The growing waiting lists mean that more people are facing hardship, pain and frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Some have died already and others will die while awaiting treatment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the waiting list crisis and the closure of hospital beds, there is a growing deterioration in the morale of staff in the health services. There is palpable anger among the people at this state of affairs.  They have great respect for the health care system and those who work within it.  They wish to ensure it is properly funded.  At a time of unprecedented economic growth and Exchequer returns they are genuinely appalled that hospital wards and operating theatres are being closed to save money.  They cannot understand why there are cutbacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is politically accountable for this appalling situation.  He cannot avoid his responsibility to account to the people for the crisis affecting hospitals and patients throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The growth in waiting lists is not a new development.  The Minister was warned time and again.  In April he asked the expert group to report on the matter.  I said at the time that, while it was necessary to conduct a strategic study, there was a need to take immediate interim measures to deal with the crisis but the Minister chose to ignore this advice.  Thousands of patients throughout the country are now paying the price.</P>
      <P>One does not need an expert group to realise that there are serious problems in the availability of hospital beds.  Steps could have been taken to open the new 50 bed nursing home in Glasnevin in my constituency which was completed in June. There are more than 2,000 people on the waiting list in the Mater Hospital and more than 3,000 in Beaumont Hospital.  Significant numbers of beds in those hospitals are required for patients who need nursing home care.  The Minister should have taken a decision to transfer 50 patients from those hospitals to the new facility mentioned at an annual cost of £12,000 compared to more than £120,000 for an acute hospital bed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been disingenuous in his comments on the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, which was introduced by the previous Government. It is good legislation.  While I agree that health boards and hospitals should not be given a blank cheque, that there should be accountability for health spending and that where budgets are set serious efforts should be made to live within them, the difficulty is that those budgets are inadequate.  The Minister likes to give the impression that he funds the service plans submitted by the health boards but that is not what happens in practice.  Invariably the allocations notified to health boards in the letters of determination in December are inadequate with the result that they have to cut their cloth to measure.  They are so short of funds as we approach the end of the year that they are not in a position to maintain services.  The Minister is hiding behind the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Section 5 of the 1996 Act states that the Minister may amend a determination by varying the maximum amount of net expenditure that a health board may incur for a particular financial year.  There is nothing to stop him, therefore, making extra funds available where health boards are productive and meet their targets early.  There should be a mechanism in place whereby health boards can be rewarded by having their budgets reviewed and increased where necessary.  They should be allowed to make further progress in waiting lists.</P>

      <P>We are in the bottom quarter of the EU league table.  Health spending as a percentage of GDP is not keeping pace with the level of prosperity.  I called on the Minister in a Private Members' motion earlier this year to link health spending with GDP but he refused to do so.  This makes sense at a time of economic growth and would ensure the health service is properly funded.  As a country in Europe boasting about our performance in a range of areas, we now find ourselves at the very bottom of the list in relation to spending on essential health services.</P>
      <P>There are many areas of our health services which are extremely problematic.  Nobody is suggesting the Minister should have solved all of those problems after almost a year and a half in office, but clear attempts should be made to tackle underlying problems.  To date there is no evidence that he has any inclination to take on that tough agenda, to grasp the nettle of sorting out the difficulties in the health services.  His approach seems to be more about keeping the lid on things, hoping the problems will not get too out of hand and that he will manage to get out of the Department of Health and Children sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The indications are that there are serious problems with the way our health services are managed.  There is a lack of accountability. I welcome the indication that the accountability legislation is to be extended to the voluntary hospital sector.  There are serious problems with the manner in which our health services are consultant-led, where consultants seem to be kings in our hospital services with no serious attempt to involve them actively in the management and accountability systems within hospitals.</P>
      <P>There is a serious shortage of hospital doctors. Currently there are 121 unfilled consultant posts across all hospitals.  I cannot understand that.  If we were to bring our hospital doctor numbers up to a level comparable with Scotland or Wales, we would need to employ another 720 consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Most patients attending accident and emergency departments in hospitals expect to be seen by a senior doctor, but because most of our big hospitals have only one accident and emergency consultant, four out of five times a patient attends, he or she will be seen by a junior hospital doctor.  Further, the likelihood is that the junior hospital doctor will not have had sleep for more than 40 hours.  I cannot understand how this or any Minister can stand over a situation where people are attending accident and emergency departments, sometimes very critically ill, and there are no senior personnel available to take critical decisions about the management of their problems.  That is unacceptable in this day and age.</P>
    <P>In out-patient departments people wait for 12 or 15 months for an appointment and when their appointment date comes, the likelihood is they will be seen by a junior hospital doctor who may have no expertise in the specialty.  I have spoken to junior hospital doctors who have grave concerns about being expected to take decisions about people, sometimes life threatening, for which they have no expertise.  That is intolerable. As a matter of urgency the Minister has to apply his energy to dealing with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister to take urgent action to deal with that very serious situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the EU is moving towards extending working time legislation to hospital doctors.  I am in the process of preparing legislation in that regard to ensure we extend the working time rule at an early date and not have long-fingered promises.  I call on the Minister to take urgent action to review the manpower requirements that will result from the 48-hour working week for hospital doctors, but also as a result of the serious shortages of senior doctors throughout our hospital services.</P>
      <P>The other serious manpower problem relates to student nurses and overall nurse numbers. Because of the manner in which nurses have been treated over the years, which has not been improved by the Minister's reaction to the commission's report, many nurses are opting out of nursing.  There are other opportunities opening up in the paramedical area, in the area of beauty therapy and so on.  There are more attractive jobs which are less stressful and better paid.  Nurses are voting with their feet and leaving.  Recently in a certain hospital in Dublin where beds had been closed during the summer to save money, it was found that they could not be opened up again in September because nurses could not be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> There is a dire shortage of nurses in the Dublin area.  There is a lack of interest among young people in the profession.  Again the Minister has failed to take action to address this urgent problem. We should have learned from the experiences in the United States in particular where many hospitals have had to close down because of a lack of nursing staff.  That same thing will happen here over the coming years unless drastic action is taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The same problem of manpower shortages arises in relation to all the therapies &mdash; occupational therapy, speech therapy and physiotherapy. There are long waiting lists in all health boards for those services and difficulties in recruiting people in those specialties.  The Minister seems to have taken a hands-off approach in dealing with manpower problems in his Department. On several parliamentary questions I tabled in relation to specific shortages, the Minister was not in a position to provide information. What is the Department doing?  Is any forward planning taking place?</P>
    <P>Child care is another area on which I could speak for another 40 minutes.  The same is true of mental and physical handicap.  There is a crisis throughout our health service.  The Minister is giving the impression that he is not particularly interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in this State should be entitled to the best quality health care when it is needed, and it should not depend on their ability to pay.  The Department of Health and Children's own health strategy outlines this principle very simply when it says:</P>
      <P>Access to health care should be determined by actual need for services rather than the ability to pay or geographic location.  It is a principle fully established at primary care level where general practitioners operate.</P>
      <P>That is not something that was established by accident.  A predecessor of this Minister was responsible for transforming primary health care. Dr. Erskine Childers abolished the old dispensary system and prevented general practitioners, by contract, from ever again discriminating between rich and poor, between public and private patients.  It was a major step, a revolutionary step towards equality.</P>
      <P>In contrast this Minister, his successor, is overseeing an acute hospital service based on a profound inequality.  The divide is widening between those who can afford to pay and those, who in the main suffer greater ill-health, who cannot.  It is a service in crisis which is not delivering care efficiently and which can only do so if the challenge of fairness and the fair deployment of resources is tackled.  The Minister is known for being pugnacious, yet his record has been to side-step rather than confront the issues which need addressing.  It is not just a matter of money but of having the same vision as Erskine Childers when he created the GMS at primary care level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital waiting lists are essentially a question of inequality of access and care.  There is a world of difference between the service afforded the private patient and that provided to the public patient.  If one can afford to pay, one can buy fast track access and better quality care upon arrival. This is no reflection on the dedicated and professional doctors, nurses and staff experiencing work overload, deteriorating morale and deepening anomalies in the acute hospital services. There is no waiting time in the casualty department of the Blackrock Clinic, yet in public hospitals patients are waiting for life saving operations in ever increasing numbers while beds are being closed in ever increasing numbers.  This is an untenable position.  The private sector is growing and the numbers joining VHI and BUPA are increasing and will continue to do so, the Minister's announcement of financial increases not-withstanding. <Col N="33" /> Hospital waiting lists are also growing &mdash; by roughly 10,000 per year since the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we do not receive the information we should to prepare for statements of this nature.  A lamentable hallmark of the Minister's is that he is secretive, defensive and has an instinct to withhold information and not publish reports paid for by taxpayers who are entitled to see them.  I remind him that these reports are not his property, they belong to the people.</P>
    <P>His about turn on the argument about the £32 million has been the subject of much anger and is another case in point.  We now know that £70 million in buoyancy will be spent on housekeeping and on demand led schemes.  It is interesting that his hard line on hospital budgets does not apply when it comes to overrunning his Department's budget.  There is one law for the Minister and another for the unfortunate people waiting for hip replacement or cardiac operations.  The legislation to which he constantly refers should be revisited and should be either used or amended. I am not afraid to say that.  That does not mean I do not believe in accountability, good management and seeking controls in hospitals.  However, if legislation leads to unbearable injustice, as it has done, and harms patients, then it should be revisited.  No legislation is sacrosanct.  The Minister is using it as a form of protection rather than a form of progress.</P>
    <P>The Government was elected on its promise in its programme that hospital waiting lists would be tackled.  It is a prime commitment in its programme, yet it is its greatest failure to date.  Until recently, there was a refusal to face the facts.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, adopted his usual entrenched position.  When I raised the alarm with the Taoiseach a while ago, I was told I was being emotive and that there was no noticeable increase in waiting lists.  I was shocked to hear a Taoiseach so out of touch with reality.  Hospital consultants are now hammering home the message in a way never witnessed before.  It is unacceptable to find consultants addressing protesting hospital staff or offering to loan money to a health board to keep things going, yet that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued that the problem requires not just money but structural change.  He is absolutely right.  However, having set up the review group and drawn conclusions from its findings, he has devised a strategy which fails to hit the mark and this is deeply worrying.  To be fair, I believe the Minister is belatedly trying to meet the commitment made in the Government programme but he is doing too little too late.  Too many patients have suffered or died unnecessarily. I fear there was a lack of courage on his part in face of powerful interests which led him to establish the Forum on Manpower.  This decision is a cop-out and only serves to delay important decisions which need to be made swiftly and decisively.  It is increasingly clear that, unless there is a radical reform of the traditional <Col N="34" /> medical manpower hierarchy and the pattern of current hospital practice, an efficient, fair and effective treatment system cannot be delivered properly.  I am sure the Minister knows as well as I, that if he is to succeed, he will have to transform the traditional consultant led nature of acute hospital care.  Unless he deals radically with the manpower issue, we will return in six or 12 months' time for a similar debate.  The only difference will be that the waiting lists will have lengthened.  What he has done is to put the problem on the long finger.</P>
    <P>A point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, must be corrected.  I am sure he did not intend it to be interpreted the way it has.  An ill patient in the accident and emergency department of a public hospital who needs admission will normally be attended to by junior doctors. Assessment is consequently lengthy and cautious and often requires many tests and then a referral. Decisions are slow.  Out of hours and at week-ends, senior opinion may not be readily available, which adds to the delay.  The path to the public hospital is dogged by a specialist deficit and this is responsible for inefficient use of valuable resources and delays.  Conversely, private patients have a completely different experience.  They have disproportionate access to consultants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to manpower requirements but with due respect, he has not yet said anything new or concrete in terms of turning a consultant led service into a specialist provided service.</P>

      <P>There are the same number of consultants in the public acute hospital service and in private care, 1,250 in each case.  In the public service, there are 2,500 junior doctors with approximately 40 in the private health care area. That speaks for itself.  That is what the Minister must address and he knows it.  He has no argument <Col N="35" /> on it.  What he is considering is whether he has the nerve to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to the issue of manpower but he must establish a fast track training system programme to deliver the level of specialists which will ensure efficiencies.  That is how the service will be made efficient.  It is not just a matter of money but how it is spent. Specialists must be trained to a wide level and range.  Without that change, no amount of hectoring by the Minister or Minister of State will change the problem.  It has been the experience in Britain and the US.  I understand the difficulties because there are major vested interests.  Unless those interests are confronted, consulted and included in the process of change, the necessary progress will not be made.</P>

      <P>It is undoubtedly true that we are facing a health crisis.  This is perhaps best exemplified in my own constituency of Dublin South-East which has seen the closure of three hospitals &mdash; the Adelaide, Harcourt Street and the Meath.  This is despite the fact that we are seeing an increase in the number of inner city residents and an increase in the number of children living in the area.  My constituents are left without adequate hospital services due to bad planning and a lack of strategy in the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister must take the blame for that.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in Dublin, the picture is not any brighter.  In St. Vincent's Hospital, four out of ten theatres have shut down due to a shortage of nursing staff.  The hospital is operating with up to 50 vacant nursing posts.  Because of budgetary restrictions the Mater Hospital has closed 57 acute beds which cannot be reopened due to the nursing shortage crisis.  The Mater has also closed one theatre and four intensive care beds.  Neurology surgery has been cut by 25 per cent in Beaumont Hospital.  A combination of budgetary restrictions and nursing shortages is being blamed for theatre cutbacks.</P>
      <P>Tallaght Hospital has been unable to open all of its 12 theatres because of staff shortages.  Consultants at Tallaght Hospital have complained that elective work at the hospital has been severely curtailed due to the unexpected extra demand for accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>What we have here is a catalogue of instances of mismanagement.  The Minister deserves a new title.  He should not be called the Minister for Health and Children but the Minister for illness and ward closures.  The situation is getting more bleak.  It is estimated that A&amp;E admissions at Tallaght are running 30 per cent ahead of the aggregate of the three hospitals Tallaght was intended to replace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I want to ask the Minister a number of questions. Will he publish, without further delay, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Tallaght Hospital? Why is he sitting on that report?  Will the Minister confirm that A&amp;E over-runs at Tallaght have caused significant cutbacks in the capacity of that hospital to offer elective surgery, despite the fact that my constituency in the south-east inner city is not adequately served by A&amp;E services?</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate, will the Minister deal with the conditions for staff and patients at St. Loman's Hospital in Dublin?  Is it the case that conditions there are bad and getting worse?  I hope the Minister is taking note of these questions.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide a breakdown of money allocated to acute hospital services in the Western Health Board, particularly in regard to University College Hospital, Galway?  Is it the case that the acute services budget allocated for UCHG was reallocated to capital development? Is the Western Health Board owed money by the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    <P>Is Tullamore General Hospital next in line for the UCHG treatment?  Have the budgetary constraints being policed by Minister Cowen already led to staff cutbacks and ward closures in Tullamore? Would that have happened if Tullamore General Hospital was located in Kerry South?</P>
    <P>Why is Portiuncula Hospital in Galway, an independent voluntary hospital, offering a consultant paediatric service once a month from a hotel room in Athlone when Athlone is the administrative area of the Midland Health Board?  Is the Minister satisfied with the consultant paediatric services available throughout the administrative area of the Midland Health Board?  Finally, what does the Minister have to say about waiting lists?</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate the Minister has left the House because all of us on the Opposition benches would press him to answer these questions. Clearly there is a lack of strategy and bad planning on the part of the Department.  Because of the Celtic tiger we have seen a baby boom and people are living longer.  As a result there will be enormous strains on our health services but the Minister has not planned for that.  I ask him to return to the House and answer the questions I have put to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for allowing me to participate in the debate.  The management of our health services is a shambles at many levels.  The Minister seems to be unable or unwilling to take a hands-on approach in dealing with the blockages in the health system that are allowing the public to lose confidence in the ability of the State to properly fund and manage our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear various complaints from the general public about waiting lists and ward closures as if these problems only arose in the past week or two.  Unfortunately, the Minister has brought much trouble on himself politically because he <Col N="37" /> was very vocal in Opposition.  In his first year in office, however, he kept his head down and many members of the public wondered if we had a Minister for Health and Children.  Some people suggested there should be a reward offered to the person who could find him.  That is in stark contrast to his high profile performances when he did not have any responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters of which the Minister for Health and Children should be ashamed.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, where I have the most experience regarding these matters, the problems of ward closures and waiting lists go hand in hand.  Up to the end of June there were 2,500 people in the South-Eastern Health Board area on various waiting lists, but 92 beds were closed during the summer and the same number of beds will close during the Christmas period.  How can that happen at a time when we know there is some latitude in the allocation the Minister for Health and Children can make to the health board, particularly in view of the £32 million available to him from the health levy?</P>
    <P>Home helps, who care for the elderly in particular, are paid £2 per hour; I know the Minister of State has a particular responsibility in this regard.  The disabled are involved in more voluntary fund-raising than ever just to meet their costs.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to an article this week in my local paper, the <i>Kilkenny People</i>, in which one of his colleagues, Councillor Brett, highlighted the fact that there is no toilet and inadequate sewerage and water services in a health centre in Kilmanagh, County Kilkenny, which has been the subject of investigation by the South-Eastern Health Board for a considerable time.  Not one extra penny was given to the South-Eastern Health Board in 1988 for capital investment.  That must be a first.</P>
    <P>Approximately 286 women have been waiting 12 months for cervical smear tests in Carlow-Kilkenny. I must conclude that the Minister for Health and Children does not have any interest in women's health.  If he had, he would alleviate the anxiety being experienced by those women and their families.</P>
    <P>In relation to the elderly, I recently met the representatives of the community homes in Kilkenny.  There are five homes at Freshford, Kilmoganny, Ballyragget, Callan and Kilmacow. Under the section 65 grants the health board gives these homes £68,550 per annum.  If the South-Eastern Health Board were to operate the homes, it would cost £823,000.  That should give a clear indication of the enormous amount of work being done on a voluntary basis in each community home in Kilkenny.  Local groups are engaged in fund-raising to help with the running costs.  Freshford, for example, raised £9,000 in local fund-raising this year but they do not know how they can keep going because they are competing with other organisations.  The nuns in the area have supplemented the labour costs of all these homes for too long.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="38" /> realises that it is a cause of concern that the nuns are not being replaced when they retire and the labour costs will increase substantially.</P>
    <P>The cost of caring for a patient in the district hospital in Castlecomer is £345 per week while the cost of staying in a community home is £951 per resident per annum, which is the subvention given by the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>If everyone in need of care was put in the charge of the health board the cost would be £4,643 per patient per year.  A small subvention to community homes would cost £951.60. Much can be done within the overall management of the health service but I am forced to conclude that the Minister, through indifference, has allowed waiting lists to grow, wards to close and a silver circle approach to the funding of our health service in local communities to develop.  The Minister is out of touch with people.</P>

      <P>What we have heard from the Opposition amounts to words to the heat of deeds.  We saw very little action from the Opposition parties when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>The year 1999 has been designated by the United Nations as International Year of Older Persons and the Government has placed importance on the development of services for older people.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for older people, I have focused attention on identifying service shortcomings and preparing a development plan to meet these shortcomings, which I hope to progress during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      <P>Economic and social progress and improved health services have combined to reduce premature mortality.  The population projections prepared by the National Council on Ageing and Older People indicate that the older population may grow by almost 108,000 persons in the period 1996-2011.  These projections also indicate that the proportion of the older population aged over 80 years will increase by more than 35,000 in the same period.  It is clear therefore, that this country has a growing population of older people and that appropriate strategies need to be put in place to ensure that older citizens lead active and fulfilling lives for as long as possible.  In this connection a health promotion strategy for older people has been published and is being acted upon at health board level.  When it is no longer possible for people to live at home or be cared for at home, an accessible treatment and caring service must be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the statutory advisory body on issues affecting older people published a major review of progress being made in the development of services for older people.  This comprehensive report highlighted a number of key areas where services require to be significantly enhanced.  It will be no surprise to Deputies, from their experience of meeting and discussing issues <Col N="39" /> with older people or their representatives, that the council has identified support for older people in the home as well as support for carers as fundamental to improving the quality of life for older people generally.  Specifically, the council has identified the home help service, respite service for carers, day care centres, paramedical services, a dedicated social work service for older people, the development of the community hospital sector and services for older people with mental disorders as services requiring immediate attention.</P>
    <P>Having examined this report and discussed the issues with the various groups which represent the interests of older people, it is clear that the greatest need lies in the provision of better community-based services, particularly in the home and including support for carers.  I intend to bring about improvements in these areas on a phased basis in line with available resources.</P>
    <P>We have already commenced this process in the current year by allocating an additional £7 million to provide new services for older people or to improve existing services.  In the acute hospital sector a new specialist department of medicine of old age has been commissioned which will enable older people to have more intensive treatment and rehabilitation.  Funding has been provided to enable community nursing units to be opened.  These units provide a wide range of services for older people, including respite and day care, day hospitals and day care centres.  The staffing of existing extended care hospitals and community services has also been improved in the current year.</P>
    <P>The need to develop mental health services for older people has been identified as a priority requirement by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in its review of services for older people.  Up to now, a specialist psychiatry of old age service was only available in Dublin and Limerick.  This year, an additional £1 million was provided to develop specialist psychiatry of old age services in other parts of the country and I intend to continue the development of this very important service next year and beyond.</P>
    <P>The private and voluntary nursing home sector has a very important role in the provision of extended care for older people.  Towards the end of 1997, the Government allocated a further £6.5 million to enable health boards to provide greater support for older people in private nursing homes.  The private nursing home sector will continue to be supported in the provision of services for older people.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister of State, I have been very conscious of the unsatisfactory physical condition of a number of extended care hospitals around the country.  I was delighted, therefore, that the Minister for Health and Children significantly increased the capital programme for older people to £14 million in 1998.  This is more than twice the corresponding figure for last year.  The Minister is not merely talking about these issues; <Col N="40" /> he is acting on them.  This investment will enable older, workhouse-type accommodation to be replaced and new facilities to be provided which will include rehabilitation, respite care and day care facilities.  For example, this new capital programme will enable 200 additional day care places to be provided throughout the country over the course of the coming year.  Day care centres make an invaluable contribution to maintaining older people in the community.  They provide social contact, relieve loneliness and isolation and enable the health status of people to be monitored and appropriate services provided. Day care centres also offer respite for carers.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue with the development of services for older people as I have outlined. I recognise that much remains to be done but given the commitment of the Government which has already been clearly demonstrated I have no doubt that it will be possible, with the greatly increased capital programme for older people announced this year, to improve the network of specialist units, community nursing units and day care centres throughout the country.  The task now facing me, as Minister of State with responsibilty for older people, will be to develop the necessary community support services so that older people and their carers will have better facilities and services closer to where they live.  I intend to implement a development plan for these services on a phased basis over the next few years in line with available resources.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, I am delighted with the progress that has been made in honouring our commitment on food safety as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  We promised to deliver an independent, science-based authority which would ensure farm-to-fork traceability in order to reassure the consumer and we have gone a long way towards meeting this promise.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority was established on an interim basis last January using existing health legislation.  This was to allow the authority to begin recruiting staff and to put the appropriate structures in place in advance of the primary legislation being enacted.  This legislation, in the form of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, became law in July and the authority will formally begin its work in January 1999.</P>
    <P>In the initial stages the authority will have service contracts with the official agencies who currently have responsibilities for food controls and I know that work is well advanced on the drafting of these contracts.  As a result of these contracts we will have, for the first time, one central authority which is directly responsible for all aspects of food safety.</P>
    <P>Each service contract will include the targets and objectives which the authority wishes the agency to meet and the time frame within which these must be achieved.  Existing funding arrangements will be maintained, that is, the agencies will make the resources available to meet their contractual obligations. <Col N="41" /> The Act also gives the authority wide powers in relation to the enforcement of food safety legislation but more importantly it requires the authority to foster a food safety culture which permeates the food chain from production right through to the final use by the consumer.  This will be achieved through a comprehensive education and training programme and by engaging all the stakeholders in food safety by appropriate means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the area of children, in particular the appointment of a children's ombudsman.  I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has responsibility for children, is in the House.  The Government has totally failed to honour its commitment to establish a children's ombudsman.  We urgently need such an office to promote children's rights.  It should have a role in relation to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Article 4 of that Convention provides that: &ldquo;States Parties shall undertake all appropriate <Col N="42" /> legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognised in the present Convention.&rdquo; In addition, Article 42 of the convention provides that: &ldquo;States Parties undertake to make the principles and provisions of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.&rdquo; Accordingly, having ratified the convention, there is an obligation on Governments to take steps to ensure compliance with these provisions to promote and protect children's rights.  One mechanism for doing this is the establishment of an independent body for the promotion and protection of children's rights such as an office of ombudsman for children.</P>
      <P>There are three reasons it is necessary to have an office of ombudsman for children in Ireland. First, a significant number of children are in situations of considerable disadvantage.  These include children in care and in legal custody, children who are subject to abuse or neglect, homeless children and children with disabilities.  In addition, households with children, especially lone parent families and families with three or more children, have a higher than average risk of living in poverty.  Research has indicated that situations of disadvantage tend to be cumulative. In other words, children from poorer households are more likely to be in care or in trouble with the law.</P>
      <P>Second, although the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, have the potential to promote the rights of children in situations of disadvantage, there is no overall mechanism for the promotion of rights of children generally.  Third, there are no structural mechanisms to protect children's rights in relation to many public bodies and services, for example, education and health systems.  Thus, in many areas there is an absence of a structured complaint and appeals system in relation to children's rights.</P>
      <P>At its first annual general meeting in March 1995, the Children's Rights Alliance decided that one of its main concerns would be the establishment of an office of the ombudsman for children, which it felt could play a significant role in implementing the convention and ensuring that children's rights were respected.  A report published by Children's Rights Alliance in September 1996, under the title &ldquo;Seen and Heard &mdash; Promoting and Protecting Children's Rights&rdquo;, outlined detailed information on the mechanisms which have existed in a number of different countries to promote and protect children's rights.  It examined various options which might be considered for Ireland.  It concluded that the setting up of an independent office of ombudsman for children established on a statutory basis &ldquo;would be the most effective and appropriate mechanism to meet the circumstances of the Irish situation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the former Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who, in December 1996, announced a commitment to the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children.  This was also part of the present Government's programme <Col N="43" /> for Government.  However, on the numerous occasions I have asked the Taoiseach to respond on the Order of Business as to when the Government will introduce this measure, he has always been evasive.  It is obvious there is no commitment by the present Government to do so.</P>
    <P>Following its examination of the first national report on the implementation of the convention, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about: &ldquo;The lack of an independent monitoring mechanism such as an Ombudsman or a child's rights commissioner accessible to children for dealing with complaints of violations of their rights, and to provide remedies for such violations.&rdquo; The committee recommended that the Government should positively reconsider the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children to further the implementation of the convention in Ireland.  The Minister of State should respond clearly as to whether, or if, an office of ombudsman for children will be established in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>Public discourse with children has been minimalist in nature and is shown by the presence of all the principal education players in the 1994 National Education Convention, with the notable exception of children.</P>
    <P>The Constitutional Review Group, the Kilkenny incest team investigation and the report of the 1995 Kelly inquiry have all stated that the Constitution's strong emphasis on the rights of the family may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to children.  A constitutional clarification of children's rights would assist in the creation of a positive environment for a newly created statutory office of ombudsman for children. Consequently, serious consideration should be given to inserting a specific and overt declaration on the rights of children in the Constitution. This would involve the amendment of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman for children should be allowed to sit and monitor child protection standards, promote examples of good practice and inquire into serious failures of practice.  It is essential, in this context, that the ombudsman enjoys <i>locus standi</i> to take legal action in the event of a public body acting in serious breach of its obligations to children. The ombudsman for children, however, should not become involved in legal proceedings until internal complaints or appeals procedures have been exhausted.  Otherwise, there is a real danger that this office could become overloaded with individual cases.  An ombudsman for children should have a role in encouraging and monitoring local complaints procedures.  The primary objectives of the office should be to make the public at all levels aware of the rights and obligations created under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Ireland in 1992.</P>
    <P>If the ombudsman for children is to genuinely <Col N="44" /> promote children's rights, the office must engage in meaningful dialogue with children.  This could be facilitated through the use of representative surveys or free hot-lines, as are used by the Norwegian and Swedish ombudsmen's offices.</P>
    <P>I envisage the children's ombudsman playing an active role in shaping and influencing public opinion, primarily through the dissemination of opinions in the media.  Alternatively, the ombudsman could lobby for amendments to legislation, such as the recognition of children's needs in environmental planning.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman for children should also act in a consultative capacity in the drafting of legislation by issuing legal advice and information at the request of other public bodies.  He or she should also be able to request Government permission to take initiatives on issues pertaining to children's rights with the corollary that the Government could also allocate such responsibility to the ombudsman where it sees fit.  The</P>
    <P>Swedish ombudsman requested permission from the Swedish Government to tackle the issue of bullying.</P>
    <P>It appears the Government has abandoned its pledge to introduce an ombudsman for children in favour of a social services inspectorate.  I disagree with this development as the independence of such a body would be open to question.  The ombudsman for children should be subject to presidential appointment acting on the recommendations of the Oireachtas.  The expenses incurred by the new office in administering its statutory responsibilities should be met from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Frank Martin, lecturer in family law in UCC, recently wrote in the Irish Journal of Family Law that children are defenceless in society and should have additional protection.  He stated that children are a voiceless and vulnerable minority in society and claims that Irish children have inadequate political and legal power.  I am pleased the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Fahey, is in the House and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I will not bore the Deputy outlining the difference and its importance. We have to be careful with ombudsmen. We have had controversy in the insurance industry with regard to the effectiveness of the ombudsman.  They are not institutions which should be set up lightly.  Careful consideration must be given to such measures.</P>
      <P>We should have a more broadly based ombudsman dealing with the entire health care sector. This is long overdue and I support such a measure.  Such an office would not only look at the issue of children but the delivery of all health care services.  It would be a huge investment in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter will know that, like the US, Europe is drifting towards a more litigious society where people sue hospitals, consultants, surgeons and so on.  This is pushing up premiums.  An ombudsman would help prevent our health care system from becoming prey to the kind of litigation Deputy Shatter thrives on in his business practice.</P>

      <P>There has been a large hue and cry from the Opposition about the £32 million. I do not wish to go over that ground but the Deputy knows this money is a figment of the Opposition's imagination.  Health care budgets are being increased by 9 per cent this year and that is good news for everyone.</P>
      <P>The previous Government increased spending on children by £10 million in 1996.  The following year this figure was reduced to £5 million.  That is the record of Members opposite when in Government.</P>
      <P>If one is to judge from the OECD report, the health care system has been given a clean bill of health.  We run an efficient system at low cost to the taxpayer.  Some would argue that we do not spend enough on health and, on average, our spending is lower than many European countries in terms of the percentage of GNP and GDP spent in this area.  There may be an argument for fixing the amount spent as a percentage of GNP and working within certain parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an argument for this but it would have to be thought out in advance.  We should not move to such a system until we have an efficient system in operation.  To introduce such a measure at present would only add to the inefficiencies.  There is no point pretending these inefficiencies do not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all painfully aware that 50 per cent of <Col N="47" /> spending in the public sector goes on staff pay. This figure is higher in the heath sector.  This is a worrying development which has to be addressed. People are worried about waiting lists and the manner in which health care is delivered, which they pay for through their taxes.  The issue is how we make the system more efficient in a period when huge demands are being made on it.  It is important that we get the health care system in order, not just because the economy is forging ahead, but because the profile of the population is predominantly young and of working age which does not place a huge demand on the system. However, when the population begins to age after 2010, we will have greater pressures on the system and we should prepare ourselves for that demand.</P>
    <P>The payroll cost must be addressed.  People are not satisfied that they are getting an efficient service and this must be examined.  Recently, there have been a number of spectacular protest marches to Leinster House.  Members will remember the march organised by the farmers and in the past week the mentally handicapped have conducted a protest.  Yesterday, the physically handicapped protested outside the House. People believe that Ireland is now a land of plenty and while we should not be irresponsible with taxpayers' money, the Minister should do something for the physically and mentally handicapped. There is cross-party agreement that these people should be better looked after and I appeal to the Minister to take some action in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any special pleas on behalf of my constituency.  However, I hope the Minister will take a balanced view of the situation in Tallaght hospital.  It was established on a stringent timetable and since it came into operation it has provided an excellent service.  When the Minister sees the consultants' report I hope he will balance its findings against the stringent deadlines to which the hospital was required to adhere.  I appeal to him to bear in mind the extraordinary difficulties any management committee or executive would encounter when merging in a single site a number of distinct hospitals with different aspects to their care provision function. I hope he will be cautious, even lenient, in relation to the overspending which might or might not have occurred.</P>
    <P>However, it is important not to send the wrong signal.  Hospitals and health boards which go overboard in their spending should not be permitted to gamble with taxpayers' money in the manner which appears to have occurred in the Western Health Board.  Such a practice should be deplored and strongly discouraged.  It is not healthy for a responsible and accountable budgeting system that health boards can break their spending limits and land the taxpayer and the Government with a large bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, correctly, is making it clear that he will not be browbeaten or emotionally blackmailed by hospitals, consultants or other care providers <Col N="48" /> when waiting lists develop due to their inefficiency in planning the health services under their control.  If Deputy Shatter has any further questions, I will be happy to answer them later.</P>

      <P>I regret that the content, tone and delivery of the Minister's contribution to this debate bore none of the seriousness, urgency and gravity the subject of hospital waiting lists deserves.  As I watched the Minister gallop through his speech, checking the clock to see if he would complete it on time, I realised that he had no understanding that people are living in fear that they will not get the surgery they need. People are living in pain and distress and some are living in fear of dying.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke with the luxury of good health.  It is a pity he does not have an awareness of what it is like not be able to secure the health service one needs.  There are 36,500 people on the hospital waiting lists and there have been 1,400 bed closures in the latter months of this year. These statistics have been quoted many times in the House over recent weeks.</P>
      <P>However, the numbers are not just statistics; they represent people.  There are 36,500 people who are sick, in pain and distress but who have no medical service.  They have no choices.  There are also 1,400 people for whom there are beds available in the hospitals but which they are not allowed to occupy.  The sooner we stop talking about statistics and begin talking about people, the sooner the reality of the problem will dawn on the Government.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, the Irish Wheelchair Association marched to Leinster House to demand their rights.  What would be the response of the Government if the 36,500 people on the waiting lists took their case to the streets, provided, of course, they were well enough to so do?  I guarantee that money would be found from all directions, just as the pleadings of an Independent Deputy were answered by the same Government.</P>
      <P>Why must the management and financial problems of health boards be shouldered by patients? I accept that every Minister must manage finances.  However, this Minister is totally cost focused, not patient focused.  He has one priority, that health boards should live within their budgets rather than deliver an optimum service.  A good health board in the eyes of this Minister is the one that does not exceed the budget, irrespective of the resulting cutbacks in patient care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has he ever seriously assessed the situation of a person who is on a hospital waiting list, is out of work and is in pain while awaiting surgery? Does he realise that if the person is out of work <Col N="49" /> for six months, he or she has their salary reduced by 50 per cent?  If because of the waiting lists and the lack of a health service the person is out of work for one year, their salary ceases.  Imagine the trauma confronting a family in such circumstances. Not only is one of its members sick but it is also a family without financial means.  The Minister does not have enough personal understanding of the crises in which people can find themselves.</P>
    <P>My constituency is also suffering due to the Minister's lack of awareness.  Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel is facing the closure of 25 beds.  It already has a waiting list of 90 patients.  I urge the Minister to get his priorities right.  He must contact the health board and ensure that south Tipperary, which has suffered a reduced health service over the years, does not suffer further.</P>
    <P>The pain of waiting is only known to those who wait.  We have the resources to end that pain and I urge the Minister to listen to our pleas in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>People cannot understand why the health service is in its current state.  Why must there be bed closures while hospital waiting lists continue to increase?  At a time of economic plenty we should work to reduce the waiting lists and to keep hospital wards open.</P>
      <P>These beds were originally provided to meet the needs of the population.  Given the current growth in our population it makes sense to provide more hospital beds, not close existing ones. It is estimated that our population will grow to 4.5 million by 2006.  That population will require the facilities of the health services.  Given the existing situation, there will be an annual growth in the hospital waiting lists and not an annual decrease, as should be the case.</P>
      <P>In the past year the waiting list of public patients in the Southern Health Board area increased by 11 per cent.  Of these, almost 800 are on the waiting list of Cork University Hospital. Many have been on the list for more than 12 months.  These public patients are dependent on assistance over which they have no control.  They live each day knowing that their health is deteriorating, in many cases to a state beyond repair. They see this happening in a country which is going through the so-called &ldquo;good times&rdquo;.  The people on waiting lists are not numbers.  They are people with families, who are also suffering, who cannot live ordinary lives because they do not enjoy good health.</P>
      <P>A person waiting for a cataract operation suffers vision that deteriorates by the day as they wait for the call to the hospital.  When they hear of ward closures, they know that call will be greatly delayed.  For what have the people on the waiting lists worked and paid their taxes and health levies?  To wait for more than 12 months on a waiting list?  The trauma of this situation cannot be overestimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the 2,487 women waiting for gynaecological services?  Over 150 of those in the <Col N="50" /> Southern Health Board region have been on the list for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>These women could be waiting for hysterectomies. A decision to have a hysterectomy is not taken lightly and is probably taken following years of suffering, discomfort, pain, time off work and so on.  The decision to perform a hysterectomy having now been made, the woman must suffer for longer and all those around her share her suffering.</P>
    <P>In Cork 3,174 people are on the waiting list, many of whom are children.  Many of them have been waiting for more than 12 months.  Children waiting for tonsillectomies must undergo unnecessary courses of antibiotics and lose vital days in school.  Who can measure the economic effect of that?</P>
    <P>A measure of our concern about the health services and for the health of citizens is the way in which we fund the hospitals.  In Cork the teaching hospital, Cork University Hospital, is grossly under funded This is a major hospital with the busiest throughput of patients in the country, far in excess of most Dublin hospitals.  The capital budget for this hospital is much lower than that of any of the Dublin hospitals to the tune of £20 million in some cases.  I make no apology for being parochial in this because the facts speak for themselves.  I am looking for equality in the health services.  The range of services in this hospital is far greater than in any of the Dublin hospitals.  It is the major hospital in the Munster region providing a range and complexity of services second to none in the State.  In Dublin the various services are spread over a range of speciality hospitals.  In Cork no matter what the speciality it is provided at Cork University Hospital, whether it be ENT, cardiology, gynaecology, ophthalmology, plastic surgery or urology. The funding for this hospital is way below that of any Dublin hospital.  This is borne out by the figures.</P>
    <P>I will make one point to underline the lack of investment in the Southern Health Board region. I made an inquiry as to the appointment of a paediatric cardiologist.  It is the view of the Southern Health Board that there should be a Cork based service for the Munster province provided by a cardiologist with specific training in congenital and hereditary heart disease for both adults and children.  At present there is no such person in the Cork region but the health board is under the impression that a paediatrician in the region is necessary to ensure that children's needs could be prioritised on the basis of their medical condition. This should be initiated at the earliest opportunity. This is the reality.  These are children suffering from heart problems who must come to Dublin.  This is a further measure of the Minister's commitment to the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Members talking about caring for people.  In dealing with the care of people, we must understand that unfortunately <Col N="51" /> health has an insatiable appetite for funding and, irrespective of the amount of money put into it, there will never be enough funding to meet all the needs of people who want to avail of either community, hospital or other services.  Therein lies the dilemma.</P>
      <P>Former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his predecessor, Deputy Howlin, saw clearly that unless we introduced accountability legislation, the health services would not develop.  Every year it had been possible for every health board to exceed its budget and expect someone else to pick up the tab.  Generally the health boards and Members of the Dáil welcomed the fact that at long last some structure was being developed whereby health boards had to manage the budgets given to them.  Every year there is a significant increase in the budget given to each health board. Obviously it will never be enough and we must accept that fact.  However, we must learn how to manage budgets efficiently and effectively.  One must have cost controls while at the same time delivering the type of service which patients need, desire and deserve.</P>
      <P>In most instances this is happening.  There is a great danger in this ongoing debate about health boards, under the new accountability legislation by which a health board is cited as having exceeded its budget provision.  Compare the Galway situation with the other health board regions. Other health boards managed their budgets and managed to ensure they stayed within them while providing a commendable level of service.  We should consider what would happen if, for instance, the Minister for Health and Children succumbed to the demands in Galway to provide additional funding at the end of the year, when it is quite obvious that the health board's budget has not been managed like those of other health boards.  It would be a licence for the other health boards to spend over and above the provision given to them for next year.  If that happened, the type of accountability which that side of the House demanded when they were in Government would go out the window.  There must be some consistency in this area in ensuring that accountability is retained and is seen as important in the overall strategic planning for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the huge demand for health services. One of the obligations of the Minister's office under the accountability legislation is that there should be an ongoing review of the budget provision and the operations within the health boards to ensure they are living with their budgets. If there was a monthly report from each of the health boards, how come the Galway health board overspent?  It is important from the Minister's perspective that his Department be even handed in ensuring that each of the health boards remains within its budget.  The early warning signs would be the indicator to departmental officials that the health board would be in trouble at the end of the year.  Within the health boards' estimates everybody knows the pattern.  They know <Col N="52" /> there will be a major demand on the services in the early part of the year and another major demand on the services in the latter part of the year.  However, during the summer period that demand levels off.  One can always close beds without any great disruption to the overall system and we have always done so.</P>
    <P>It is important I refer to the acute hospital sector. Over the years there has been a significant increase in the amount of money provided to the acute hospitals.  Budget demands continue to rise and the amount of money given continues to rise on an annual basis.  With regard to the waiting lists, what level of accountability exists?  I am not making a political point, I want to ensure that we get value for money.  I want to establish that there are norms within the acute hospital sector.  Can anybody in any hospital or in the Department state the normal number of procedures which would be carried out by a consultant in the orthopaedic sector or cardiac services, for example? Should a consultant be in a position to carry out 100 procedures per year on public patients?  Does it differ from one acute hospital to another?  Is there a consultant in Dublin carrying out 150 procedures on public patients and another in Cork carrying out 50 procedures?  Are statistical data available to us on the relativities between various hospitals and various consultants as to the number of procedures carried out?</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago we had a major waiting list initiative in the orthopaedic sector.  Patients from Cork were flown to Belfast to have operations carried out.  However, I note the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery has increased dramatically.  What impact did the previous provision of funds have on this sector?  Obviously there is an increased demand in the number of people seeking orthopaedic services.  How often are reviews carried out in orthopaedics?  Does a person who has had a hip replacement return after three, five or seven years?</P>
    <P>There has to be accountability on all sides. That is why the report of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative is important.  In the event of any future review of waiting lists and the provision of additional funds, I urge the Minister to ensure there is productivity and that it will have a long-term impact on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>It is believed that 10 per cent of those attending accident and emergency departments need never be there.  Does that mean that people are referred to accident and emergency departments by general practitioners who could be adequately dealt with in the surgeries of these general practitioners? University Hospital Cork has a 60 per cent throughput in accident and emergency.  That means 6,000 patients have gone through the system who would never have been there, thus clogging the system.  Perhaps the time has come when the Minister should seek the co-operation of the College of General Practitioners, the accident and emergency departments, hospital managers and consumers.  One can imagine the frustration of the patient in the accident and emergency waiting <Col N="53" /> room, who often has to wait many hours. Much of this frustration could be avoided if there was a greater level of co-operation between accident and emergency departments, GPs and the patient and we might have a better and more effective system in accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same way as he is turning his back on the patients in Galway.  It is obvious he did not want to speak in advance of me because it would not take long for me to refute the misinformation he is putting out about this matter.  During the question and answer session I will question him.</P>
      <P>I welcome the concession to have this delayed debate on the health services.  I regret the Taoiseach did not concede this debate when we raised this matter on the Order of Business last week. Following several Adjournment debates he gradually conceded there should be statements by the leaders.  When I insisted on speaking on the matter, I was ejected from the Dáil, which I very much regret.  I welcome the fact that we are having a debate on this matter.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister of State from my constituency to listen to the debate with an open mind and not say they can do nothing about the problem when clearly they can.</P>
      <P>In University College Hospital, Galway, the health board management has decided to close a theatre, two wards and to lay off 45 nurses.  This has reduced the theatre capacity by 20 per cent. There is now the extraordinary situation where the four remaining theatres are working on a 24-hour basis.  What could be more crazy than to close one theatre and make the others work around the clock, without adequate time in which to prepare for the next procedure?</P>
      <P>The ward closures are causing concern in Galway to patients, families of patients on waiting lists, those on waiting lists and to doctors, nurses and staff who are working in a chaotic situation trying to fight the case.  I welcome some of the nurses from Galway to the Public Gallery today. They are trying to fight against closing wards and yet continue to do their legitimate duty providing nursing care in the hospital.  How can we allow this situation to continue?  The laying off of 45 nurses means that those competent, experienced nurses will be lost to Galway because they will get jobs elsewhere.  I have experience of this, given that one of my daughters is a nurse and she can get a nursing post anywhere in Ireland or in the world because of the demand for nurses.  Yet in Galway we are sending 45 nurses elsewhere. They will not be in situ next year, if and when we get the waiting list initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> I cannot understand the reason the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is turning his back on the situation developing in his own constituency.  The closing of theatre wards in University College Hospital, Galway, until 1 January will add an estimated 800 patients to the waiting list.  Already the waiting list in Galway has increased from 2,079 in June 1997 to 2,891 in June 1998 &mdash; a 38 per cent increase, one of the largest increases in any health board hospital.  Some 1,386 who were on the waiting list when this Government took office were still on the waiting list 12 months later.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will refer to this when replying.</P>
    <P>The money promised for the waiting list initiative next year will be required to deal with the backlog of patients not being dealt with now. How short-sighted can the Government be and what bad value for money that will be?  Despite what Deputy O'Keeffe has been sent in to say, the problem arises simply because an adequate budget has not been provided by the Minister to run the health services in our region.</P>
    <P>The additional increase in the Western Health Board budget this year &mdash; excluding non-pay increases and development funds, which are ring-fenced &mdash; was £835,000, an increase of 1.5 per cent.  With inflation running at 3 per cent and medical inflation running at more than 20 per cent, how in the name of God can we run our health services with that inadequate funding? That is the key to the problem.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to properly fund the health service, he would have a case for asking health boards to remain within their budgets.  The simple fact is we are not getting enough money to run a proper health service at University College Hospital, Galway.  This is typical of the discrimination by this Government against the west.  For example, the University College Hospital, Galway, budget at £45 million can compare to that of a similar hospital, St. Vincent's in Dublin, which provides the same procedures on a budget of £70 million.  This is evidence of the Government's discrimination. In the first instance the blame for the crisis in Galway rests with the Minister in not providing the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>I am amazed the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is turning his back on the situation in Galway. During the last general election, Senator Fahey, as he was then, conducted his campaign from the hospital.  Headlines in newspapers at the time read: &ldquo;Politics is all About People &mdash; Vote Frank Fahey of Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party&rdquo;&mdash; it did not say anything about the patients' party; &ldquo;Bertie Ahern Committed to the Highest Standards at Galway Hospital&rdquo;; &ldquo;Ten Thousand Leaflets on Trolley to Make UCHG an Election Issue&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy nothing positive to say about Galway?  He should say something about capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="55" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time he laid the blame at the then Minister's door.  However, he has changed his tune since becoming Minister of State and he has embarked on an attack on management. He said in the local media that the hospital is not being run as it should be, there is bad bed and patient management, there are fundamental management problems and that new management structures are not working.  I do not know if there is any foundation to these accusations, but if there is evidence of bad management, he should set up an investigation.  I will support him if he provides funding to keep the theatres and wards open.</P>
      <P>Credence is being given to the Minister's statement because the hospital and health board management have not publicly refuted it.  These are serious allegations and I am surprised they have not been refuted.  Perhaps the hospital management is afraid the Minister in his vindictiveness will reduce the promised capital budget if his remarks are refuted.</P>

When he was a Senator a year ago he conducted his election campaign from the hospital in co-operation with the hospital manager, whom he is now condemning. He conducted a radio programme from the emergency ward of the hospital and interviewed patients with the co-operation of the management. He is turning on the management in order to cloud the fact that there is not enough money for health services in Galway.</P>

If adequate funding is given, I will support any investigation.  The wards must be kept open because it is false economy to close <Col N="56" /> them.  It is false political economy for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, because the people of west Galway will be waiting for him at the next election.

      <P>Waiting lists have been a problem for many years.  I was unfortunate to have to visit the casualty department of Beaumont Hospital in January 1997 where I had to wait 12 hours.  I noted on that night that approximately 50 per cent of the people did not need to be there as they had cut fingers and minor injuries.  Only one doctor and nurse attended on that occasion, so this problem is not new.  The Minister recognises this and is taking the necessary action to resolve it.  Some £12 million was allocated this year for waiting lists, which is an increase of 50 per cent on the amount provided by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister provided £750,000 to extend the angiogram unit at Beaumont Hospital in my constituency. One would get the impression from listening to this debate that the Minister for Health and Children is playing bingo or is sitting on his laurels.  However, that is not the case. There has been an increase, not a decrease, in overall general expenditure this year.</P>
      <P>When the Minister took office last year he made it a priority to tackle the long waiting lists and times.  He undertook a number of initiatives aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of waiting lists.  As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said, accountability for performance related activities must be the norm.  It is not good enough to throw money at something which is breaking down as that will not solve the problem.  There must be accountability, proper structures and a means of measuring performance.</P>

      <P>We must tackle the issue of the rights of our older citizens who require home support and easily accessible services.  The number of older people will increase significantly over the next 15 years.  I am pleased the Minister proposes to allocate substantial funding to provide the necessary services for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of key areas need urgent attention, including home help, respite support, support for carers who often experience stress and hardship and services for older people with mental health <Col N="57" /> problems.  There is also a need for better community-based services, particularly care in the home.  Due recognition should be given to family carers who, in many cases, are prisoners in their homes and find shopping trips too difficult to contemplate. I have highlighted these problems to the Minister and he will make the necessary funding available to improve services.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for any public representative to make political capital out of the health services or people who are sick.  This Minister has done more for the health services, the elderly and the deprived people in our society than any other Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>During my discussions with the Minister he recognised, as did the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, the need to increase the level of support for voluntary organisations which care for the elderly in their homes and in senior citizen complexes.  I pay tribute to the great work done by those who work in voluntary organisations in my constituency of Dublin North-East and to those in Dublin Corporation who make life more enjoyable for many of our senior citizens.  People give of their time voluntarily to provide meals on wheels for the elderly in St. Anne's Court, Rosedale Court, Rosevale Court, Raheny Court and Greendale Court.  The wife of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, has done voluntary work in Greendale Court for many years.  Fianna Fáil has always been a caring party and has looked after the elderly.</P>

I am pleased to have this opportunity to spell out what the Minister proposes to do for those people and the programmes that are in place.  The provision of additional residential respite and day care services was outlined in Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap. There is also a document entitled An Assessment of Need 1997 to 2001.  An additional £25 million will be allocated for services for those people, which is more than double the additional funding allocated by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put in place a £30 million national capital programme to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need programme to provide the necessary infrastructure to support those services.  This is the first time such a programme has been provided and it allows for multi-annual planning to develop these services.  There is also a need to provide residential care centres.  Many parents of children with a <Col N="58" /> mental handicap have told me they are terrified about what will happen to their children when they pass away.  They are afraid their children will be put into institutions and forgotten about.  I made suggestions to the Minister on how to address the needs of those people and he has taken the necessary steps in that regard.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement of a £13 million capital project for St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane, funded jointly by the Department and the Eastern Health Board, is particularly welcome.  I am proud to be part of a Government which, for the first time, not only fully appreciates the need for this development but is prepared to provide the necessary funding to ensure it becomes a reality. Those are some of the projects about which I have spoken to the Minister and which he has taken on board.  He has also taken on board many of the suggestions made by other Deputies, including Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the debate, one would get the impression we do not have a Minister for Health and Children and that this is the first time there have been waiting lists, but one cannot argue with the facts.  The Opposition can try to make political capital out of this, but that is all it can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue because health issues have always been a concern for the public.  Everyone has cause to be concerned about his or her health and access to healthcare at some time during their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we were forced to have this debate, but I regret it has taken place so soon after the last general election.  The debate might be better structured around the Minister's political health rather than health issues.  There has been a sea change in his position.  Less than a year and a half ago when he was the main Opposition spokesperson on health he visited in-patient, out-patient and accident and emergency departments in hospitals around the country and explained all he knew about this problem to those he met.  He intoned kind, endearing and calming words and put across the message that in the event, unlikely as it seemed then, if he was given the opportunity to have responsibility for this area, he would resolve all their problems.  He walked into my local hospital as cool as a cucumber and intoned to all and sundry that when he was in a position to do something about the problem, there would be dramatic change.  He made one sorrowful mistake, which people often make when they theorise about something on which they do not have sufficient information.  He forgot that the people to whom he spoke took everything he said as being the gospel truth and that he would be able <Col N="59" /> to deliver on his promises.  He misread the position and did not assess it properly.</P>
    <P>We have heard him repeatedly state he has given more money to the health services than was ever given before, but that is not an argument.  It is not a reason for closing hospital beds and wards, for people sitting on trolleys awaiting examination, for people sitting in hospitals for two or three days before they are examined or for keeping people on waiting lists for hip replacement operations, cardiac and other surgery for three or four years.  That is not an excuse for low level to which our health services has degenerated.</P>
    <P>The Chair has as good a knowledge of the health services as anybody else and he will know what I said is true.  It is regrettable the Minister indicated to those on hospital waiting lists that if he had responsibility for health, all their sorrows would be over and they would be brought to the promised land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister, when he was the main Opposition spokesperson for health, had not created such hype, there would have been a much better understanding of the problem and he would have been in a better position to address it when he was given responsibility for doing so. It is time he moved to another Department to protect his political health and safety.  He should consider doing that to protect the health and safety of patients, hospital staff and the health services.</P>
      <P>It is fine to make promises in the run-up to a general election and to presume that if one is elected one will deliver on them.  Promises may be made in good faith, but it is tantamount to a crime to make promises to those who are vulnerable, to those with disabilities or to those waiting day after day to be called for surgical procedures, and not deliver on them.  We do not have the necessary time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We do not have time to detail the various categories of hospital and health services that are in need of an overhaul by the Minister and the Ministers of State responsible.  It may be fine to assume that in a few years' time we will be able to resolve these problems, but I do not believe that is possible.  The Minister has misread the position.  When he was in Opposition he failed to properly estimate the full degree of the requirements of the health services and he is now paying the price.  To ensure there will no further <Col N="60" /> damage to the health services and that no more vulnerable people on hospital waiting lists suffer, the Minister should move over and allow someone who knows something about the health services to take over from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing time.  During this debate the Minister and Government backbenchers have stated that this issue will not be resolved by throwing good money after bad.  Is that an adequate response to the people lying on hospital trolleys in Galway hospital and other hospitals?  Is it an adequate response to those who will be obliged to remain on waiting lists indefinitely?  Is it an adequate response to the people who cannot gain access to services they urgently require?</P>
      <P>The Government's statement that it will control non-capital expenditure within set limits is understandable.  However, if the health service continues to be adversely affected, there will be an obligation on the Minister of the day to intervene to provide adequate funding for basic services when and where the need arises.  No one, health boards or individuals, can budget for sickness, which means that there is always a need for flexibility and discretion.  The Minister and his Ministers of State have shown that they are not prepared to grant such flexibility or discretion. They have also shown a callous disregard for the people's needs in terms of the provision of health services.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that the management of hospitals such as University College Hospital, Galway, should be forced to close wards or to make 45 nurses redundant while elderly patients are obliged to remain indefinitely on trolleys in the casualty department.  Following yesterday's breakdown in talks, will administrative staff at the hospital, without the co-operation of nursing or medical staff, force patients to transfer out of certain wards in order that they can be closed?  That type of scenario is unprecedented and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The callous indifference of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, to the problems at University College Hospital, Galway, will rebound on him politically. When he served as a Senator in the Upper House, for reasons of political gain he highlighted the situation at the hospital. However, now that he has reached a position of power, he has turned his back on the staff of the hospital.  That is scandalous and I hope it will return to haunt him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise another issue of great concern to people in the constituency of East Galway.  The owners of Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, recently decided to withdraw from the provision of health services there and they offered the Western Health Board the opportunity to take over the hospital.  I pay tribute to the role the owners played in developing a magnificent hospital which has delivered an excellent service to Ballinasloe and its hinterland for many years. <Col N="61" /> Portiuncula is recognised by the Department of Health and Children as an efficient hospital and I hope it will be allowed to continue as such. However, I fear that this will not be the case if the hospital comes within the remit of the Western Health Board.  People have legitimate concerns about the hospital's being taken over by the health board, particularly in view of the situation which obtains at University College Hospital, Galway.  I hope that waiting lists and ward closures will never be necessary at Portiuncula.  Given that 40 per cent of the patients who attend Portiuncula Hospital come from the Midland Health Board area &mdash; in which the Minister's constituency is situated &mdash; will the Minister urgently investigate the possibility of maintaining the current level of services at the hospital?  I suggest that an independent management body be appointed to allow the hospital to serve the Western and Midland Health Board areas.  It would be a pity if the services provided by the staff of the hospital were lost.</P>

      <P>The Government increased the level of investment by 50 per cent in 1997, from £8 million to £12 million, and it is striving to reverse the increase in waiting list numbers from a low base.  The Minister outlined the initiatives that have been put in place.  I accept that waiting list numbers currently stand at approximately 34,000.  However, it would be naive of Members to forget that the numbers were allowed to increase substantially during the previous Government's term of office.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that a 50 per cent increase in funding has been provided and that waiting lists have finally stabilised, it is important to remember that a fundamental problem remains to be tackled.  The Minister for Health and Children has set about tackling it in a fundamental way.  As he stated earlier, in the forthcoming budget he will announce the implementation of initiatives based on the work carried out by the review group which will deal with waiting lists in an effective, proper, planned and long-term way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dispute in respect of the proposed closure of 57 beds and a theatre at University College Hospital, Galway, discussions unfortunately broke down yesterday at the Labour Relations Commission.

      <P>The provisions of the Act are clear and they apply to all agencies.  They were made clear to the Western Health Board by the Minister when he met its representatives at the end of last year and they were reiterated in subsequent correspondence from the Department of Health and Children in July and October of this year. The legislation places an imperative on health boards to deliver on their service plans within <Col N="63" /> budget and over the course of the year to take appropriate measures, where necessary, to achieve this.</P>
      <P>The legislation in question was drawn up by the parties opposite during their time in Government.

      <P>What the people of Galway want is to have the question of the closure of two wards and an operating theatre taken out of the negotiations currently taking place so that we can get on with addressing every other issue, including those mentioned by the Minister of State.  It is disappointing that the Minister of State and other Government speakers have not addressed the specific point made by Deputy Shortall when she spoke this morning.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996, which was passed during the period when I was in Government. There is nothing in that legislation to stop the Minister addressing exceptional circumstances. Specifically, section 5(3) of the main Act states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may amend a determination under subsection (1) by varying the maximum amount of net expenditure that a health board may incur for a particular financial year and, if the Minister so varies that amount, he or she shall notify the health board concerned in writing of the extent of the amendment as soon as may be and the determination shall apply and have effect as so amended.</P>
      <P>That was put in specifically to allow ministerial discretion.  It is a point that should be unemotively discussed because, if the baseline upon which the budget is calculated is inadequate, it will throw up problems like the ones we are experiencing.  The issue is a simple one.  Why does the Minister of State not take the powers in the Act under section 5(3) and address the issue? This would have the effect of eliminating the principal obstacle to the resolution of the difficulties that arise at present.</P>
      <P>It is a complete confusion to suggest that the labour relations consultations which broke down yesterday have any capacity to deal with this problem.  It is beyond the capacity of those talks to answer the fundamental problem.  We are now faced with a fundamental point.  There are 3,494 people on waiting lists at University College Hospital.  It has been stated by those who are in charge of administrative decision-making that there was a demand during the summer when demand was expected to fall.  It has also been pointed out that there are additional costs associated with capital development.  There is ample scope to consider giving, by way of supplementary allocation, such sum as would relieve the current problem.  That is what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the time in three minutes, nor <Col N="66" /> have I the inclination, to start going back over the long history of Deputy Fahey in relation to the hospital.  I find it appalling that the hospital, its needs, its patients' needs, the structure of its staff management, are made a political football.  If, as has been pointed out by Deputy McCormack and others, there are management difficulties that require intervention, our support is forthcoming for the resolution of these.  What the public wants, what the community wants, is the taking of the closure of the wards and the operating theatre out of the equation.  It is time for the hypocrisy to end.</P>
    <P>I was a member of Government.  I have stated what was in the 1996 Act.  It does not preclude additional funding.  When we were in Government people used to say they wanted the Government to act.  Now that we are in Opposition it is suggested that it is a problem for all of us.  We accept that but it is the Government that is responsible for decision making.  The Minister has the capacity to act under section 5(3) of the 1996 Act.</P>

      <P>The manner in which the Government has sought to tackle the crisis in the health service is scandalous.  For years the catch-cry was that there was not enough money available to provide the services required.  Although the Minister and the Ministers of State have sought to deny it, a sum of £32 million made available in the 1998 Estimates remains unspent.  As a result 70 staff are to lose their jobs in Galway.  I agree with Deputy Higgins.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from making additional funds available to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>It is now easier to gain entry to the Connacht final, a livestock mart or to get out of a traffic jam than it is to be admitted to hospital.  When on this side of the House a week did not go by without the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, having some story about University College Hospital, Galway, for <i>The Connacht Tribune.</i>  With his ministerial colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, he had all the answers, but they have made a hash of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided on the first day of winter that two wards would have to close.  This runs contrary to the trend in every other country in the civilised world.  For many years the Minister of State and I worked hard on behalf of the Western Health Board to ensure the provision of a clean air theatre which would be available throughout the summer. For whatever reason it was closed this summer. It is the responsibility of the Minister of <Col N="67" /> State to solve the problem at University College Hospital, Galway in the next six weeks.  What he appears to be saying is that people should not get sick before New Year's Day.</P>

      <P>The slogan was that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  Yesterday four patients from County Mayo were admitted to University College Hospital, Galway, at 1 p.m. Beds did not become available until 8 p.m. Yet, it is proposed to close two wards and an operating theatre.  It is a disgrace that the Minister who takes no prisoners and is not afraid to stand up for what he believes allows £32 million to remain unspent.  Earlier this week the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, described the problems at the hospital as minor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are all aware of how serious are the problems.  There are 34,331 people on hospital waiting lists.  At a time of unprecedented growth in the economy and Exchequer returns &mdash; there is a budget surplus of £1.3 billion &mdash; one would expect a Government to provide the additional funds required to ensure patients receive the care and treatment they require.  In what can only be described as a sick joke the Government has decided to close hospital wards and lay off nursing staff.  This is cruel and heartless. It is alarming that the Government is showing such callous disregard for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there are 1,700 patients on the waiting list at Tullamore General Hospital, it is proposed <Col N="68" /> to lay off 17 nursing and administrative staff.  This is scandalous.  Something has gone seriously wrong.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, spoke of a quick fix solution by throwing money at the problem.  That is reminiscent of what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said. That is not the solution.  We are dealing with human beings, people of all age groups, who continue to suffer.  Much is said of the economic boom and the Celtic tiger.  The manner in which the Government is dealing with people on hospital waiting lists would put Shylock to shame.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure additional funding is provided immediately.  We are witnessing uncalled for and wasteful expenditure of Government funding while people are on hospital waiting lists.  Something must change and the Government must provide the necessary finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise a number of issues regarding the health service. The Minister will undoubtedly refer to a new allocation of money to the health service next week but he must live with the fact his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, obtained an additional £91.5 million for his Department.  Those on hospital waiting lists for hip replacements and other operations are asking if the Minister for Health and Children is aware of the crisis, if he is hiding behind the legislation he claims he is bound by, or if he is prepared to obtain the necessary funds at this time of the so-called Celtic tiger to ensure people do not continue to suffer as they do at present.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, was and the current Minister, Deputy Cowen, is committed to the programme for the North-Eastern Health Board region, especially the proposal to upgrade Monaghan General Hospital.  That is an absolute necessity and the Minister should make clear in his next proposal that it will be funded.  I realise it cannot be upgraded in one year.  Since there is a three year programme for the health service, I have no doubt he can find the necessary funding to provide the extra theatre and beds for the hospital. There are excellent consultants there but that has created its own problem.  When they are on duty, there is complete chaos in terms of car parking. It is urgent that it be tackled if a serious crisis is to be averted.  Ambulances and other urgent and necessary services cannot get through.  Security is also an issue.  A number of us met senior executives of the North-Eastern Health Board who assured us the problem will be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Navan Orthopaedic Hospital is another serious matter.  It has given a great service to our constituency over the years.  Unfortunately, it seems the beds are not available to provide the level of service specialists working there wish to provide. A pensioner, who is required to stay in a home in Northern Ireland paid for by the health board, has been on a waiting list for ages to enter Navan hospital although there is a bed for him in a health board facility in Monaghan town were he <Col N="69" /> able to use it.  However, he cannot do so because of a serious orthopaedic problem.  A handicapped 25 year old has been on a waiting list for a year and this has caused enormous problems for his family.  A 90 year old needs a small operation but cannot get a date.  The surgeon wishes to carry it out but does not have the facilities available to him.  Another person requires an operation on a joint.</P>
    <P>I received a letter the other day from a lady in Monaghan town who asked why her appointment had been cancelled.  She had been on a waiting list for two years to receive treatment in Omagh hospital when she received the following letter:</P>
    <P>Dear Patient</P>
    <P>I am sorry to inform you that your admission for Monday, 26th October 1998 has been postponed.</P>
    <P>We have been instructed by the North-Eastern Health Board in association with Sperrin Lakeland Health &amp; Social Care Trust that no further operations will be undertaken until further notice for patients from the Cavan/Monaghan area.  You will be given a new date as soon as [possible]</P>
    <P>It is possible in conjunction with our friends across the Border, both in Omagh and Belfast, to reduce waiting lists.  The Minister has an opportunity to provide the funds to give people their rights.  As his party said some years ago, the poor, sick and handicapped should not be discriminated against at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: It was a nauseating spectacle to witness the trading of insults in the Dáil a half hour ago between senior Deputies in Fine Gael representing the west and Fianna Fáil Ministers of State also representing the west.  It was particularly so when one considers it happened on the backs of people in Galway and throughout the country who face serious problems. The policies of both parties and their actions in recent years have been equally culpable for the current crisis.  It is extreme cynicism for both parties to pretend they have fundamentally different policies in the area of health services and the provision of proper health care for all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both parties underpin the philosophy which dominates this society in its economic choices and structures, where the profits of individuals, corporations and powerful vested interests come strictly before the desperate needs of people on hospital waiting lists.  The scandals revealed over past years show the priorities of those who form the establishment in this society.  There was the revelation of the massive rip off of taxation by powerful interests such as the banks.  We do not know the full amount involved, but it would, had it been properly investigated, undoubtedly have amounted to hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  Imagine the difference that would have made if, instead of going into private pockets and offshore accounts, it was invested in <Col N="70" /> health services to relieve the suffering so obvious at present.  Similarly, there was a huge tax amnesty introduced by a previous Government which wiped out hundreds of millions of pounds which could and should have been invested in the health of our people rather than going into the pockets of the super rich.</P>
    <P>It is nauseating to see the health service and the health needs of our people used as a source of profiteering by private interests.  I find it objectionable to see private insurance medical companies muscling in to the health service.  I also find objectionable the advertisements they use to try to do this in which health care becomes a product to be marketed in the same way as soap powder and patients become clients to be exploited rather than human beings to be treated and cared for.  We need a comprehensive public health care policy to meet the needs of our people and to end the two tier structure that currently exists in our health care system.</P>
    <P>Private consultants take a disproportionate share of resources.  Pharmaceutical companies, powerful multinationals, make enormous profits from health care products, medicines, etc. Resources, which should be put towards the provision of better care, are being soaked up by these vested interests.  Those resources could be and used to eliminate hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The controversies of recent weeks have again highlighted the suffering of those on the hospital waiting lists.  Senior medical physicians are now speaking out.  One doctor, in an article on the Mater Hospital in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> said that the shortage of space meant he had been virtually unable to admit any patients, many of whom require urgent attention.  He went on to outline the case of a man from Ballymun who is suffering severely from a prostate gland problem.  The would-be patient, who is racked with pain, urgently requires surgery but there is nothing he can do to admit him to hospital.</P>
    <P>This crisis has come about as a result of the false priorities of the main political parties that have dominated Government for decades.  As a result of political decisions taken we are now experiencing this crisis.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 November, Dr. Miriam Wiley, head of the Health Policy Research Centre at the ESRI, states:</P>
    <P>The proportion of GDP devoted to health in Ireland ranked joint fifth relative to other member-states in 1985, and 11th in 1990.  Since 1993, the only EU member-states to spend a smaller proportion of GDP on health are the UK, Luxembourg and Greece.</P>
    <P>That is a categoric indication of what was allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, referred to food safety in his contribution.  Many people are concerned that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has utterly failed to move on one aspect of food safety.  In Opposition, Fianna Fáil had a clear position on <Col N="71" /> food safety.  It stated that current scientific knowledge is inadequate to protect the consumer and the environment from the unpredictable and potentially disastrous effects which may appear immediately or at any time in the future.  Fianna Fáil said it will not support what amounts to the largest nutritional experiment in human history with the consumer as guinea pig.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has already spoken and probably will not get an opportunity to respond, but it is shameful that a Fianna Fáil dominated Government continues to sit on the sidelines while these products are sold to consumers as part of what it referred to as the largest nutritional experiment in human history.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to voluntary groups like Genetic Concern, two members of which &mdash; Clare Watson and Quentin Gargan &mdash; have been on a vigil outside Leinster House for the past 24 hours to draw attention to the negligence of the Government in this regard.  Pressure must come from ordinary people because it is obvious the Government will not move on its own.  We must have legislation on these dangerous products and prevent the powerful vested interests and multinational companies turning our people into guinea pigs for the sake of their profits, as they have done with the health service as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  I welcome the debate.  I am a member of the Mid-Western Health Board which has focused on the waiting list issue at many of its meetings.</P>
      <P>Another area of major concern is the ophthalmology waiting list in the Mid-Western Health Board area which increased by 17 per cent from December last year to the end of September this year.  A total of 766 people are now waiting for ophthalmology services.  Many of those on the list are elderly people who need cataract operations. I raised this issue recently with my health board because it is important for older people to be able to read a newspaper, but there is a considerable waiting time before a person is called for a cataract operation.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board, in its budgetary submission, will signal its concern in this area and seek additional funding for associated theatre costs.  I hope those concerns are reflected in an increased budget for that area because if resources are provided, results are achieved.  That was highlighted by the success of the Orthopaedic Hospital in Croom where there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of people waiting for hip and knee operations.  A fifth orthopaedic surgeon was recruited and an extra operating theatre opened.  More needs to be done, but I wanted to highlight the positive action that has been taken in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ear, nose and throat waiting list is increasing and is a major cause of concern because young people cannot attend school if they have a <Col N="72" /> hearing impairment.  That problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>We must also address the problem of what has been called the invisible waiting list, the people waiting to get an appointment with a consultant. We all know constituents who require serious operations.  It is interesting that the health boards do not have statistics in this regard.  I would have liked to say more on this topic, but I will pass over to my colleague, Deputy Reynolds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A person to whom I spoke last week told me that in 1970 there were 95 administrators in the Eastern Health Board area. The figure for 1998 is 7,500, which represents an enormous increase.  How much of the total health Estimate is spent on administration in all the health board areas?  The crisis we are currently experiencing in the health area is due to the fact that much of the money is being spent on administration, not at the coal-face.</P>
      <P>I come from the North-Western Health Board area which has been held up as an example for other health board areas.  In Sligo General Hospital, however, waiting lists have increased by 47 per cent in the past year and a half.  If that is the most efficient health board area, I would not like to know what the least efficient one is doing. How much money is being provided for the administration of the health service rather than the provision of services?  If the Minister and Ministers of State are courageous they will try to resolve this problem and spend money where it is most needed, on the people waiting for operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The key outcome from the fourth conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which concluded in Buenos Aires last week was the adoption of a Buenos Aires plan of action.  This establishes deadlines for decisions in the year 2000 on the mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol for achievement of emission targets, such as emissions trading, joint implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.  Work programmes on compliance issues and for co-operation on policies and measures were also identified to enable operative decisions to be taken immediately after the Kyoto Protocol enters into force.</P>
      <P>The conference also made progress on a number of issues including the transfer of technology, where a process was agreed towards overcoming the barriers to the transfer of environmentally sound technology to assist developing countries. In addition, it was decided to provide further support from the Global Environment Facility, including support to developing countries vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, with legally binding emissions targets for the countries of the developed world, was a very significant stage in the global effort to combat climate change.  By adopting the Buenos Aires plan of action the key aim of maintaining the momentum of Kyoto was achieved.  While Ireland's position in common with that of the EU throughout the negotiations was to press for maximum progress, the outcome is a balanced reflection of the differing concerns and positions of the many parties involved in climate change negotiations.</P>
      <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol Ireland's target is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2000-2012.  A number of measures are currently in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in detail in Ireland's second national communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change.  Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there has been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia,</i> address climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of preparing a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto protocol, a consultancy study, Limitation and Reduction of CO 2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland, was published by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise in June 1998 as a basis for public consultation.  On 28 October 1998, the two Departments held a discussion forum for interested bodies, organisations and <Col N="74" /> individuals who made submissions to the report. The submissions made and the wideranging discussion at the forum will be utilised in the development of the national strategy.  This is being prepared for Government approval at the earliest possible date.  The strategy will provide a framework for achieving Ireland's Kyoto commitment, building upon existing measures and developing additional policies and measures for implementation in all sectors in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner.</P>
    <P>In relation to current emissions, inventories prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency based on official Government data such as national energy statistics and other activity data show that the net increase over the period 1990 to 1996 for the greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol was 3.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Regarding proposals to raise funds for less industrialised nations, Ireland as party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is committed to the provision of new and additional financial resources to assist developing country parties comply with their obligations under the convention and to support sustainable development in less developed countries.  The Global Environment Facility, GEF, is the means by which the financial obligations of developed countries parties to the convention are met.  This is the principal international environmental fund and it provides grants and concessional funds to developing countries for projects and activities aimed at protecting the global environment.  In Buenos Aires it was agreed that assistance provided under this mechanism to countries which are vulnerable to the effects of climate change would be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Ireland has pledged approximately £3.8 million for the period 1998 to 2000 to this fund.  This represents an increase of £2.1 million or 124 per cent over the period 1994-97 when we contributed £1.7 million to the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is outrageous of the Minister to take these three questions together because they deal with three different and very distinct aspects of very important issues.  It is deplorable that the Minister should produce an answer which skims over all the issues without dealing with any one in detail.  Will he give three or four examples of the measures in Ireland's communication, to which he referred, which are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country?</P>
      <P>Will he give three or four examples of measures which are in place and which are specifically designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to moderate the rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions?</P>
      <P>Will he indicate if he believes the funding being made available under the Global Environment Facility will make a significant impact on climate change problems in developing countries?  It seems to me that the amounts of money involved are pitifully inadequate to meet the problems being faced in such countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Has any progress been made with suggestions that funding be increased by the kind of measures I referred to in Question No. 1 such as global energy taxes and global energy use taxes which could be used for the kind of work the Global Environment Facility is intended to do?</P>

The policies and measures in the second national communication in relation to the question of climate change included intensified energy efficiency and conservation programmes by the Irish energy centre, the establishment of an energy advisory board by the Minister for Public Enterprise to advise on energy efficiency, renewable energy and related research, the implementation of the EU SAVE programme, demand side management in the ESB, significant alternative and renewable energy programmes, AER 1, 2 and 3, the promotion of combined heat and power, the improved efficiency of electricity generation and distribution, the operational programme for transport which is the investment programme to improve efficiency in transport, the implementation of the Dublin transport initiative and the establishment of the DTO, the national afforestation programme and codes of good practice for fertiliser use in agriculture, all of which are or have been implemented.  Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol we have implemented a number of other measures including the revised technical guidance documents which accompany the building regulations and the waste strategy which I launched in October.  Wind farm development and other forms of renewable energy are continuing apace and the Deputy will be aware that some incentives were given for these in the last budget. The Deputy asked for three or four examples and this list is considerably longer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement reached on the amount paid into the funds is negotiated.  I agree with the Deputy that if more funds were made available and if the parties to this framework convention <Col N="76" /> agreed, developing countries would welcome more funds.  The EU, and Ireland as a member state, took a lead position on this at the conference. We wanted all parties to the convention to go further than they did in all areas.  However, the Deputy, who has some experience in this matter, will know that in international negotiations one generally gets so far and one must then make a value judgment as to whether one can achieve anything by pushing further, or whether one must settle for what one has.  This is not the optimum position as far as Ireland or the EU are concerned. We will try to give the lead in this area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to global sources of funding and there was a suggestion that a global tax on aircraft fuel could be used to augment the funding for developing countries.  It was not possible to reach agreement on that proposal at the conference, but the matter will be considered in the context of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  It was also suggested that an adaptation tax, which would apply to the flexibility mechanisms to which Deputies referred, would help developing countries meet their adaptation costs.  It was agreed that would be negotiated further at the next two conferences, COP V and COP VI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that most of the measures he instanced as being designed to reduce the rate of increase in our greenhouse gas emissions are either ones that would have been in places for other reasons &mdash; such as the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which was not even partly designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions &mdash; demonstration measures, such as the AER 1, 2 and 3 or encouragement measures?  We have advisory organisations to beat the band, but none of these measures is of a constraining nature.</P>
      <P>As long as we maintain an approach based on measures of that kind, it is likely to have very little effect.  That has been amply demonstrated by one simple fact.  My colleague, Deputy Clune, tabled a question today about a waste management strategy, which was refused this morning on the grounds that there is no ministerial responsibility for it.  That is something I would like to take up with you separately, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>When a key part of environmental policy, which can impinge on greenhouse gas emissions, is a matter for which there is no ministerial responsibility, will the Minister agree that I am right to feel sceptical about the seriousness of our efforts to reduce such emissions?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that some of the measures &mdash; but only some &mdash; I mentioned earlier are not specifically designed to reduce emissions.  There is no argument about that.  He highlighted a number of them but the waste management strategy and technical guidance documents were drawn up having regard to our future commitments following the Kyoto protocol.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to go into great detail on climate change now because of a forthcoming question on the matter, there seems to be some misunderstanding about it.  We have not yet adopted a climate change convention because we are in the process of developing a strategy.  I hope we will reach the later question that deals with the matter.  I accept we must do more.  A &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; scenario would mean an increase of 28 per cent on 1990 emission levels, while our target is 13 per cent.  I accept what Deputy Dukes said about strategy and the need to make decisions.  We are trying to do that nationally on the basis of discussions with people, as we did internationally at Kyoto.  We have had submissions and a conference on this matter which included interested parties.  We now intend to undertake further discussions to try to publish an abatement strategy early in the new year, to which everybody will be obliged to subscribe.  A variety of measures need to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more specific and concentrate on transport, which has out-stripped electricity generation as the fastest growing contributor to emissions?  How will we reduce our emissions to 13 per cent when car numbers far outstrip any projected increases?  Are cars imported from Japan, which fail emission tests there after three years, contributing to our greenhouse gases?  What is the Minister prepared to do about this matter?</P>
      <P>The Minister said he has had discussions with the Minister for Public Enterprise, but what about the Department of Agriculture and Food? He mentioned a code of good practice regarding fertilisers, but that has not been effective in reducing the amount of fertiliser we are using. Fertilisers are contributing to our methane emissions, as are land fill dumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I tabled earlier concerned the suggestion that super dumps would be located around the country.  Where do such dumps tie in with the Minister's waste management strategy?  I <Col N="78" /> have read his statement which projects wonderful recycling targets that I would like to see met, but all I can see are more and more super dumps. What is the connection between the reduction in land fill and these super dumps that are appearing around the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport is one of the main contributors to emissions.  It will have to be dealt with by a number of means, including investment in public transport and more stringent restrictions on emission levels from cars.  A number of European directives under the auto-oil programme include recommendations in that regard.  There may be a need for further measures in this area. The abatement strategy refers across the board to issues including agriculture, energy, tourism and so on.  All of these areas will be catered for.  We may have a chance to discuss this issue later.</P>

      <P>The referral of matters to the Law Reform Commission rests with the Attorney General.

Why has it taken so long for the Minister of State's Department and other Departments to take this matter to the Law Reform Commission?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 10 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Assessments of local authority housing needs in accordance with section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, are carried out every three years.  I have directed that the next assessments be carried out at 31 March 1999.  The assessments will provide details of the extent and nature of housing needs in each local authority area.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive guidelines have issued to local authorities in a memorandum in relation to carrying out the assessments of need for housing accommodation and sites for travellers, and of the number of homeless persons.  Copies of the memorandum have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Details of the assessment of housing needs carried out in March 1996 for each local authority are given in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for 1996 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I expect that about 3,500 houses will be completed or purchased by local authorities in 1998. These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable some 9,500 households to be catered for in 1998.  This figure should increase to 10,000 households in 1999.</P>
      <P>Social housing programmes have been the main beneficiaries of the increased resources devoted to housing in the Estimates published last week.  Having regard to increasing needs and reflecting the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to the local authority housing programme, I have secured greatly increased resources for the provision of local authority housing for 1999.  A capital provision of almost £230 million will be available to local authorities.  This is an increase of almost £35 million, or 18 per cent, on the 1998 provision of £194 million.  This substantial increase provides for the expansion of the local authority housing programme from 3,900 to 4,500 starts in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure which will contribute to meeting social housing need is the increase which I have secured in the level of assistance available under the capital assistance scheme for voluntary housing.  From 1 December, the limits for single or two person units will be £44,000 in cities and the greater Dublin area and £37,000 elsewhere, increases of 63 per cent and 37 per cent respectively <Col N="82" /> since this Government took office.  The equivalent limits for family type housing are £55,000 and £47,000, increases of 67 per cent and 42 per cent respectively in the same period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities will be notified shortly of their programme of authorised starts for 1999.  It is a matter for local authorities to respond to housing needs in their areas by developing the full potential of the various measures available to them.  I will remind them that the traditional means of meeting social housing needs through the provision of local authority housing should continue to be supplemented by the range of other social housing measures.  I expect that the greatly enhanced provision for the social housing programmes for 1999 will considerably improve the capacity to meet social housing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State referred to social housing, what is his position on the establishment of a housing commission?  Last May in the House he stated that he rejected the proposal. During the summer he told the Society of St. Vincent de Paul he was amenable to the suggestion. What is his view?  Is it similar to his position on gazumping, that is, to wait one or two years before taking action?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State think it appropriate and correct to immediately introduce an emergency assessment of housing need, given that the last assessment took place in March 1996?  Why must we wait until March next year for an assessment?  Is it not the case that since this Government took office housing lists nationally have increased by more than 50 per cent?</P>

I received those suggestions during another recent meeting and they are currently being examined.  I will respond to them in the near future.</P>
      <P>There is a statutory requirement under the housing Acts to conduct a major comprehensive assessment of housing applications in each local authority every three years.  That is the assessment being carried out.  All local authorities have access to information on their housing lists and I have been in contact with them to assess the situation in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  I cannot get the exact and comprehensive information a housing assessment would provide but I can get a rough indication of what is happening.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in 1998, 148 houses were built for Dublin Corporation?  Is he aware that in 1989 the number was nil, in 1990 it was 25, in 1991 it was 74, in 1992 it was 80, in 1993 it was 71, in 1994 it was 277&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was prefacing the question and I had almost finished.  In 1995 the number was 366, in 1996 it was 310 and in 1997 it was 181. The estimate for this year is 230.  Is the Minister of State further aware that this figure compares with a high of more than 1,700 houses per annum built for Dublin Corporation in the early 1980s?</P>
      <P>Does he agree that local authority housing stock as a share of total housing stock is shrinking and is down from 20 per cent in the 1960s to less than 9 per cent today?  Does he also agree that it is one of the smallest local authority housing stock shares in Europe and is the fastest declining?</P>
      <P>Would he, therefore, agree that it is time to examine, first, the option of creating a common housing list for all local authorities in Dublin and, second, the possibility of building houses &mdash; on the scale of those built in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown &mdash; for Dublin Corporation in other counties, while providing the necessary infrastructure to bring people to and from the city and putting in place a good social mix from the beginning to avoid later problems?  Is it not time to examine that approach to dealing with the problem?</P>
      <P>If there is a massive local authority house building programme, it will remove the pressure from the private sector and give people an opportunity to purchase houses, an opportunity they do not have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a need for a substantial increase in the provision of new local authority housing.  I succeeded in securing additional funding to ensure that an extra 600 local authority houses will be started in 1999. Allocations have not yet been made as to where the extra starts will be located.</P>
      <P>When looking at the housing funding being provided by the Government, one must take into account existing housing stock in the Dublin area. There is a great deal of old housing accommodation which is not suitable for habitation in this day and age.  The Government is committing substantial sums of money towards the regeneration of these old housing estates to ensure that the people who live there will have a better quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Estimates, the Government has committed itself to a programme which will cost £90 million over a period of five years to regenerate approximately nine blackspot local authority housing areas in Dublin city.  That is a major commitment <Col N="85" /> to ensuring that local authority tenants can live in comfortable surroundings.  This Government has also taken the initiative in providing for the removal of older apartments and flat complexes which, in themselves, were causing major social problems for their inhabitants.</P>
    <P>The regeneration of Ballymun is ongoing.  A total of £20 million is being provided for it in this year's Estimates.  The previous Government talked about regeneration but did not provide one penny towards it.  This Government is providing the funding and the programme is under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal is being done.  A sum of £19.5 million is being provided for remedial works other than the two projects I mentioned. When the extra 600 houses are being allocated, I will bear in mind Deputy Mitchell's comments on the needs in Dublin.</P>
      <P>However, it is worth emphasising that there are other options through which local authorities can work with the voluntary housing agencies to increase the number of homes that can be made available for people who currently qualify for the housing lists and for others with medium incomes. I am not satisfied we are achieving the level of output that should be achieved from the assistance being provided through the capital assistance and the rental subsidy schemes.  The two schemes have great potential.  There is also the low cost sites scheme which has largely not been availed of by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There are a number of schemes in the system which should add to the overall output of public housing but which are not being availed of to the optimum level.  I am working on creating greater awareness among the members and officials of local authorities about the potential that exists.  I am also trying to ease difficulties or obstacles that might have created problems for housing authorities in achieving higher output levels under the schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that more and more people are being added to housing lists because private landlords are selling property?  There are many instances of this in my constituency.  There was the example which I raised here of Crampton Buildings in Temple Bar.  As a result of the booming economy, landlords will make a great deal of money from selling these properties.  In response to various questions which I tabled to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have been told that this is a constitutional problem.  We cannot provide security of tenure for tenants because we afford such huge rights to property owners in the Constitution.  If we are to move towards a European model where people live in rented accommodation, will the Department co-operate with the Department of Justice, Equality <Col N="86" /> and Law Reform and whoever else necessary to amend the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>I am in discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to ways in which tenants could be given greater security of tenure.  Those discussions are ongoing.  This is a complex area, particularly taking into account what the Deputy stated about the Constitution.  I hope that out of that may come some positive proposals which we could implement to make it more attractive for people to take the renting option.  The rented sector has a major part to play in providing homes for people.  The vast majority of Irish people aspire to owning their own home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Does the Minister agree that a home is one of the most urgent human needs and, therefore, an affordable home for all is a fundamental human right?  In view of that, does he agree that 600 extra starts in 1999 is pathetic as an alleged measure to end the suffering of people on the waiting lists &mdash; the over-crowding, the tensions, the worries and the distress which public representatives see on a weekly basis?  In Fingal County Council alone, in the year to last month 1,400 extra people joined the housing list.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the rule of profiteering which has seen house prices rise by 107 per cent in the new private market in four and a half years is immoral and outrageous, and that the political parties of this and the previous Government which have not taken on the profiteers should be condemned?  Will he agree that an emergency investment programme is crucial now so that in a three to five year period the waiting lists can be addressed and everybody can be accommodated?  Will the Minister agree that the expected £90 million which will be given this year to private landlords by health boards is a scandalous subsidisation of those who have contributed to the housing crisis, and that instead those funds should be used, for example, to finance a major investment programme?  Up to £1 billion of bor-rowed money could be financed by £90 million per year.  That would go a substantial way towards providing permanent homes for those people who are at the mercy of the private landlord sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has allocated £521 million for housing in the Estimates for next year.  The provision of homes for people is a top priority with this Government.  With the amount of taxpayers' money which is being provided to assist in the provision of the housing programme, I and many others would be of the opinion that we could achieve a much higher number of housing units were it not for the fact that building prices and land prices are so excessive, and they are excessive because of the supply problem that exists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a schizophrenic approach <Col N="88" /> on the part of people who support the need for public housing and to tackle house prices and on the other hand oppose the zoning of land for housing and the implementation of higher densities on lands where it is appropriate and which could be achieved with good result.  If we continue to keep a limit on the amount of land on which we are prepared to allow houses to be built, then we are perpetuating high prices for building land.  The overall housing problem is one of supply and demand.  The only way in which it can be tackled is to increase the supply and bring it into equilibrium with the demand.  We must start with the availability of land for building.  If that is maintained artificially low, then the price will be high.</P>
      <P>One must take all those factors into account. We are not getting good value for the sum of more than £0.5 billion which we are making available. I am approving public housing tenders and contracts for amounts which are grossly in excess of what was required two or three years ago. Therefore, I am getting a poor return in terms of the number of houses for the huge increase in taxpayers' money which the Government is committing to this problem.  We are looking at every possible angle to see how we can increase the supply of land, the supply of services to land and the supply of houses.  It is only by increasing the supply to equilibrium with the level of existing demand that we can bring some sense and reason back to house prices.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a change in the shared ownership scheme?  This scheme has more or less ground to a halt because it no longer takes into account the serious increase in the price of houses even in rural areas.  If it was changed to allow a lesser amount of the house purchase price to be borne by the purchaser, it would be a means to enable more people to buy second hand houses.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership scheme, which I was the first to advocate in this House many years ago, is one of the ways in which we should be able to achieve a substantial increase in the housing output.  Not enough use is being made of the shared ownership scheme.  I increased the income limits for a single person to £20,000 last year &mdash; the Minister introduced it in the Finance Bill, 1998.  We are looking at the shared ownership scheme to see how it can be adjusted further to make it more attractive.  Many people are not aware of the shared ownership scheme but if encouraged would avail of that <Col N="89" /> option.  I am considering the possibility of an advertising campaign rather than relying on local authorities to advertise the availability of these schemes.  Also, I am working with the local authorities to ensure the eligibility procedures for shared ownership are simplified, where possible, to make it more attractive for people to use it.</P>

      <P>There are two items of legislation involved here &mdash; a planning Bill which comes under the auspices of my Department and a National Inventory of Architectural Heritage Bill under the auspices of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  An additional £5 million is being provided for the combination of grant schemes &mdash; £4 million will go towards the scheme of grants being put in place, £300,000 will go directly to local authorities to enable them employ people to do this work and £800,000 to the Department for the preparation of the inventory and other associated tasks.  The terms and conditions of the scheme which will be transparent are being drawn up. This group will take into account the provisions of the 1982 Finance Act.  It is hoped the scheme which is being worked on by a group representative of my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Heritage Council and the City and County Managers Association will be announced before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The green network of Government Departments, originally established in l994, was relaunched last May, at senior management level, with a wide-ranging brief to deepen cross-departmental awareness of the environmental agenda.  The network is chaired by my Department and has had two meetings so far this year. It is working within the overall framework of An Action Programme for the Millennium, under which one of the major objectives of Government is to make concern for the environment central to all policy decisions, and against the background of Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, which also identified integration of environmental considerations into Government decision-making as a key mechanism in the pursuit of sustainable development.</P>
      <P>To date, the network has focused its work in a number of specific areas, in particular to bring environmental and economic perspectives to the complex task of integration.  It has reviewed relevant experience in Europe, and is developing a pilot system for the eco-auditing of policies in Ireland.  It has agreed &ldquo;task management&rdquo; arrangements to lead and report on the detailed measures necessary to implement the national sustainable development strategy.  It has reviewed the European Commission Communication on Partnership for Integration and Eurl conclusions, from June l998, prioritising integration at EU level in the areas of transport, energy and agriculture. It has also considered necessary preparations for a forthcoming OECD environmental performance review of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition, the network provides a forum for ongoing emphasis on the internalisation of environmental considerations across Government Departments, and for discussion of cross-cutting issues including climate change policy, economic instruments for environmental protection and green housekeeping.</P>

      <P>The Minister has touched on a number of issues.  Does he agree it is vital to have co-operation if we want to make an impact on such a huge and complex topic as climate change? The Minister promised to look at eco auditing prior to the election.  What progress has been made on this vital issue?  He managed to win support from the green lobby through election promises, but many of these people are disappointed with what has happened.  Is the Department of Finance the stumbling block?  The Minister mentioned interdependence and co-operation.  If we want a sustainability strategy, we should have eco taxes.  The green taxation committee is up and running, although I do not know what progress has been made.  Is the Department of Finance not playing ball on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak about eco auditing in the context of a range of policies, legislative measures, etc.  I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this green network and of integrating policies and environmental considerations <Col N="93" /> and concerns across Departments.  The green network of Departments is focusing on eco auditing and trying to bring forward a model for all Departments.  They are discussing this together to ensure there is a formal procedure for identifying the environmental impact of sectoral policies across the board, including legislative measures, plans, programmes, policy statements, etc.</P>
      <P>When preparing the original policy document, I thought this aspect would be a lot more simple than it is, particularly when it came to identifying what needs to be done in terms of eco auditing policies.  We are looking at systems in other countries and the best example we have seen is in Denmark.  The eco audit will address significant positive or negative impacts on the environment, alternative policy options in certain cases, measures which will eliminate or mitigate harmful effects and identification of environmental standards or licensing arrangements which will help the environment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about green taxes.  I will pursue an agenda for the budget which will include a green tax system.  We made a small start in the motor tax system earlier this year.  We must be conscious at all times of CPI, for which the Department of Finance has responsibility. Departments and Ministers accept the need to move in this direction, but I would like to see them moving a little faster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the analysis of Mr. John FitzGerald of the ESRI that the only way we can tackle CO 2 abatement is through the imposition of energy taxes?  As regards eco auditing, it is important that we look at sustainability indicators and that we do not measure our progress only on the basis of the Celtic tiger, but also on the quality of life.  Eco auditing goes hand in hand with sustainability indicators.  What progress has been made on that?</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister supports green taxation. How long will we have to wait before it is introduced? I do not want to sound alarmist, but we are facing serious global problems and each country must play a role and face up to its commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that sustainability must be addressed and it is being addressed by the green network of Departments on an ongoing basis.  Sometimes progress is a lot slower than we would like.  Comhar, the new sustainable development partnership forum, in consultation with the task managers we have set up under the green network of Departments, will agree a timetable on the progress being made by the task managers in the implementation of the sustainable development strategy.  I hope this will not only be discussed and advanced in the green network of Departments, but that it will also have a public face in the partnership forum.</P>

That is the analysis of the ESRI, although other commentators might have a different view.  I want to know where the Minister stands on this issue.  Does he support the transfer of CO 2 credits or the imposition of energy taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards meeting our commitments, we must look at a range of measures.  I do not agree with the ESRI analysis, but I have no problem expressing the view that we must introduce environmental and energy taxes to attain the targets we have set ourselves for 2008 to 2012. The sooner people in industry and agriculture realise that, the better.  That is why we are going through this process at present.</P>

Does the Minister agree with recent newspaper reports that Europe will impose punitive measures on us for exceeding our levels of CO 2 emissions?  If we introduce energy taxes, we will not be competitive in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not avoid the issue of energy or green taxes, but discuss their merits or otherwise.  That is why the ESRI report and one or two other reports are helpful.  Competition is an issue.  However, people who say it will make Irish industry less competitive should look at the examples of Denmark and the Scandinavian countries which have energy taxes but are no less competitive.  It is a question of how one introduces the tax.  When we speak about energy or green taxes, we should not focus only on energy. There are other mechanisms we should discuss in a positive manner.  We could discuss clean technology, energy conservation and sustainability and more efficient use of existing technology to reduce the existing level of waste.  We should not focus on any particular set of measures because we will have to adopt a range of measures to ensure we meet these targets.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter Deputy Clune raised, it is the subject of a later question.  We are using 1996 figures in this regard.  We have no means of verifying the figures in the newspaper article to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <Quest>when he will approve the revised proposals for the Dungarvan sewerage scheme, County Waterford, and allow<Col N="95" /> Waterford County Council to proceed to prepare contract documents and seek tenders for the scheme.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24134/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1993, Waterford Council, in association with Waterford Foods plc. , appointed consultants to prepare a preliminary report and an environmental impact statement for a joint wastewater treatment plant to cater for Dungarvan's domestic and industrial and wastewater needs.  The environmental impact statement was certified in January 1996.</P>
      <P>Following the merger of Waterford Foods with Avonmore, the company decided to close its operations in Dungarvan.  This decision had significant implications for the design of the proposed wastewater treatment plant.  Accordingly my Department requested the council to review the preliminary report and the council's response was submitted to my Department in February of this year.  Following examination of the council's submission, the council was requested to consider a number of technical matters and to submit a supplementary report.  This report was submitted to my Department on 19 October last and is at present being examined technically.</P>
      <P>The scheme, which has a current estimated cost of over £10 million, is included in the current water services investment programme to be advanced through planning.  I am not yet in a position to say when approval may issue to the revised preliminary report for the scheme.  I expect the local authority will be in a position to further progress the planning of the scheme, including the issue of obtaining the necessary foreshore licence in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  The proposed scheme is included in the programme to be advanced through planning and provided there are no delays because of technical problems, the proposal will not be held up in the Department for financial reasons.  That might be the assurance the Deputy wants.  I cannot give him a precise date as to when the scheme will go to tender because there may be a delay in regard to the foreshore licence, but I can assure him the proposal will be moved forward and there will be no undue delay in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the provision of such a scheme is pivotal to the industrial development of Dungarvan town?  The scheme is badly needed because the town has lost Waterford Foods and we want to attract replacement industries, but we need the proposed sewerage <Col N="96" /> scheme to facilitate the location of such industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is well aware of the impact on the town of the loss of that company. It might have been easier to say the proposed scheme is no longer as urgent as it once was, but we regard it as being more urgent because of the need to facilitate change in the town.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>if he will amend the planning laws to make health and safety plans mandatory in any planning permission application in view of the level of accidents and deaths in the construction industry.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21149/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Health and safety plans are mandatory for most construction sites under the Safety, Health and Welfare At Work (Construction), Regulations 1995 (S.  I. No. 138 of 1995).  This is an independent statutory code.  Site safety is not an appropriate matter for regulation under planning legislation.</P>
      <P>While the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs has responsibility for worker safety, in view of my overall responsibilities in relation to the construction industry I have repeatedly expressed my deep concern about the unacceptable level of fatal accidents and injuries on building sites.  The report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry, Building Our Future Together, published in June 1997, contained important recommendations to relation to site safety.  In October 1997 I established a Forum for the Construction Industry to oversee and advise on the implementation of the almost 90 recommendations contained in this report.</P>
      <P>In August l998 I asked the forum, as a matter of urgency, to furnish me an interim report on improving the health, safety and welfare of construction workers.  I understand that interim report is nearing completion and will be submitted to me next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply he is not considering any change to planning legislation in the context of the proposed planning legislation which will come before the House in the next six months and, if so, will he reconsider that?  It would be a good idea to make a health and safety report mandatory in any planning permission application.  Until we focus the mind of the construction industry on this issue in the context of the planning permission process, there will not be a reduction in the number accidents and deaths that have increasingly occurred on building sites in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have made the position <Col N="97" /> clear.  Such plans are mandatory for most construction sites, but they are not mandatory under planning legislation.  Such legislation is not particularly suitable for the inclusion of that type of code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with enforcements.  If provisions on specific activity have to be adhered to in respect of a planning permission application, builders will be more conscious about implementing such provisions when a building is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that is true.  I tend to take the opposite view.  It is better to include such provisions in specific legislation on health and safety rather than include them under the planning code.  The Deputy will be aware from his experience at local level that planning enforcement officers are put to the pin of their collar trying to enforce the planning regulations. It is better to maintain the focus on this area where it is at present.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, recently recruited an additional 13 staff to this specific area and that should assist us in improving the position.  I share the Deputy's concern, but I do not consider it is appropriate to include such provisions in planning legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 85 together</P>
      <P>It is open to local authorities to utilise existing housing landbanks, or to acquire land, to make housing sites at low cost available for the purposes of assisting persons in housing need to provide their own housing.  Such housing may be provided either individually, with the help, if necessary, of the other social housing measures, including shared ownership, local authority house purchase loans and the mortgage allowance, or collectively, through the voluntary housing schemes, special group shared ownership projects or housing co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The provision by local authorities of low cost sites, either serviced or unserviced, to people in need of housing is a long standing social housing option.  I and my Department regularly encourage local authorities to be creative in their response to the social housing needs of their areas and to avail of the full range of options available to them, including the provision of sites.  I regard the provisions of low cost sites by local authorities as an important element in their response to the housing needs of their areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not present earlier when I said I am not satisfied that adequate use is being made of the various housing options by local authorities and others.  Proper use of those options could help us to achieve a much greater housing output.  I referred to the low cost housing scheme which I consider to be a valuable instrument and which is not being utilised to the greatest possible extent.  This scheme could bring about enormous benefits.  It is disappointing that in the last full year &mdash; 1997 &mdash; for which figures are available, 191 sites were sold by local authorities under the scheme.  I instigated a review of this matter and discussions in respect of it are ongoing.  I hope to achieve a substantial increase in the local authorities' use of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to local authorities, if they wish, to acquire land by agreement or by compulsory purchase order for their housing functions.  Loans from the housing finance agency and other sources totalling £3.7 million were authorised this year for the specific purpose of housing land acquisition.  Applications from local authorities for loans to acquire lands are readily approved by the Department and I encourage them to make such applications.  Local authorities can dispose <Col N="99" /> of land to voluntary and co-operative housing bodies under the low cost housing scheme and, as already stated, the price can be as low as £100 per site.  Authorities may reclaim from the Department the original cost of sites so disposed plus interest charges for up to five years and less receipts in respect of the sites.  In 1998, £2 million was provided for the low cost sites scheme which represents a substantial increase on the 1997 figure of £857,000.  This housing option is not being fully availed of by local authorities and I am anxious to see positive action taken in respect of it.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I have discovered a reluctance on the part of the management of local authorities to increase the holdings in their land banks.  The latest figures I obtained from the combined local authorities indicate that in total they hold approximately 4,500 acres.  However, the bulk of these lands are not situated in areas of highest demand.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the order of the House of today, the Minister for Health and Children will now take questions on the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Minister for Health and Children the extraordinary approach taken earlier today by the Minister of State at his Department.  I presume the Minister is aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, when discussing the state of waiting lists and the difficulties experienced by hospitals, referred to everyone playing a part in the difficult decisions that often go with trying to match immeasurable demands with measurable resources.  Regardless of differences which exist between us, I am sure the Minister will agree that, in the context of the health area, to some degree there will always be demands which cannot be met.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to reconcile the fact that the Minister of State can state one thing in the House and something different in his constituency? It appears that Deputy Fahey roars like a lion in his constituency and squeaks like a mouse when in the House which is a phrase used by the late Deputy Kemmy to describe another Member of the House on a different occasion. Has the Minister seen the <i>Connacht Sentinel</i> of Tuesday, 10 November which carried the rather elaborate headline &ldquo;Fahey tells meeting: &lsquo;Hospital cuts fault of top management&rsquo;&rdquo;?  In dealing with the situation in Galway, is he aware that the Minister of State is quoted as saying that the closure of two wards and a theatre would only save £200,000 and that this would not solve the problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is normal practice for Members to stand during their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Chair's pardon.  I had assumed the rules to be less formal, given that we are involved in a question and answer session.  Is the Minister aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, criticised Billy Moran, chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, by stating &ldquo;The closure of two wards and a theatre are only going to save £200,000.  This is not going to solve the problem.  I am satisfied it was not necessary to do it this way.&rdquo; The Minister of State also said that he would ask Mr. Moran not to proceed with the closure of the two wards and the theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how the approach taken by the Minister of State in his constituency can be reconciled with what he told the House earlier about playing a part in the difficult decisions to which he apparently wishes to be a party in this House but placed apart from when <Col N="101" /> outside it?  Will the Minister discipline Deputy Fahey for his attack on a public servant who was not present to defend himself?  Will he also indicate to the House the steps Deputy Fahey, as Minister of State, has taken within the Department to try to ensure that beds do not close in Galway and to ensure that the theatre which has been closed for the past three weeks will be reopened?</P>

      <P>It seems we will spend the next hour playing political games.  Deputy Shatter wishes to make a personal attack on the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Fahey, and I understand such attacks were made earlier by Deputies McCormack and Ulick Burke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State said the same thing in his constituency and in the House he would not be the subject of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's view and obviously he has political reasons to state it.  Let us stop playing games.  Additional funding will not be provided for the hospital services.  Since last December, everyone was aware of the nature of the outlined strategy and the purpose of the accountability legislation.  Members will be aware of this because several of them, including Deputies McCormack and Shortall, have served on health boards.  I have no problem explaining that we will not go back to the situation that obtained up to recently when we had to plan and develop health services on the basis of allocations made long after the start of the financial year and deputations trooping into Ministers mid-year to bid for more moneys because expenditure was above what was targeted for.  In the interest of greater transparency and accountability, the policy of successive Governments since 1993, when historic deficits, totalling £120 million, were eliminated, has been to bring forward prompt payment legislation to ensure small suppliers to the health services do not have to wait ten or 12 months for payment because budgets in the health sector are way out of line.  That legislation had the support of everybody in the House and everyone accepted it had to be done.  We introduced the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996, the purpose of which is to make sure we deal first with situations where people get allocations and letters of determination prior to the start of the financial year, to give an opportunity to the health agencies to draw up a service plan, not three or four, during the year, based on the allocation made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these legislative frameworks is to bring some semblance of planning into the health service.  Now they are on the Opposition <Col N="102" /> benches, the Deputies opposite say we should not mind that, but put more money into the health service willy-nilly and we will have a better health service.  If that were the case, we would have a better health service, because that is what has been done up to now.  That does not work.  I have made a political decision, with which people in this House may wish to disagree.  It has been my contention since I became Minister for Health and Children that the capital base, valued at more than £4.5 billion, the infrastructure which we use to try to deliver a health service, requires major capital investment.  We cannot have a situation where equipment is replaced only if it breaks down, paid for with money taken out of revenues. We have to put forward a designated capital budget for that purpose.  I have decided on a £10 million re-equipment budget every year to bring more capital investment into the health service so that we can improve morale in the service which has not seen a capital investment programme worth the name for years.  Those are the facts. If we want to improve morale in an organisation perhaps we should put more money into the physical environment in which people work.  The only way to do that is to enhance the capital programme. If people say this is being done at the expense of day-to-day expenditure in the health service, my reply to that is that last year the increase on day-to-day expenditure was 9 per cent and in 1999 it will be 9.5 per cent.  Leaving aside our political differences for a moment, if we all agree there is a finite amount to be spent on the health service during a year, how can we plan for the development of the health service if we then say the service plan drawn up at the beginning of the year means nothing.  That makes no sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between us is simply that the last Government refused to draw up a capital investment programme worth the name for the health service and put money on the revenue side.  I have decided on a much increased revenue allocation &mdash; 9 per cent this year, exceeding £3 billion for the first time on day-to-day expenditure, and 9.5 per cent next year on the revenue side.  I have an enhanced capital programme to deal with the underlying problems. The underlying cause of the difficulty in delivering a quality health service is that we have not had a capital investment programme worth the name for years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, should not interrupt across the floor.  Let us try to have an orderly question session.  The purpose of question time is to elicit information.  If Members do not want to ask questions, that is fine.  It is a matter for the Members.  I will hear Deputy McManus now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions for the Minister.  The first relates to the legislation he has been citing and which I believe he is hiding behind.  That is particularly the case in relation to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.  Will the Minister confirm that there is nothing in the 1996 Health (Amendment) Act which precludes him <Col N="104" /> from making additional funding available to health boards?</P>
      <P>Second, in relation to the allocation, the Minister makes much play of the fact that health boards draw up their service plans, the budget is provided and they have to live within that.  I do not deny it makes absolute sense to have clear legislation in place which obliges health boards to live within budget.  The point I would make is that we are in a unique situation this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If at the end of Question Time Members have not had an opportunity to ask questions, it is because people are making repetitive statements.  This morning we had statements from Members.  This is Question Time.  While I would like the Minister to give Members an opportunity to ask questions and curtail his remarks, the Chair has no responsibility or control over the Minister.  The Chair does have control over Members, and I will insist, because there was an opportunity for statements this morning, that Members ask questions.  There are a number of Members offering, and I want to ensure that as many of them as possible have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in a time of plenty, when we have a budget surplus in excess of £1 billion, it makes sense to invest a proportion of that huge surplus in our health service to relieve the huge pressures that exist, and that if we do not do that in a time of plenty, we will never do it?</P>
      <P>My third question relates to the increase in the gross health Vote of 9.5 per cent.  How much of that 9.5 per cent is likely to be taken up, first, with medical inflation and, second, with pay increases already agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the questions as briefly and as quickly as I can.  In relation to the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, we are introducing a Supplementary Estimate precisely to put more money back into the health boards, for example, in relation to demand-led schemes.  If the question specifically asks whether I will use Supplementary Estimates to put more money into the hospitals, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The reason suggested in the statements of Labour Party speakers this morning &mdash; the idea that section 5 provides an automatic bail-out at any time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that the legislation asks that a serious effort be made to work within budgets.  It does more than that, it places a statutory obligation on agencies to work within their allocations.  It is not a question of making a serious effort and reverting half way through the year to the old system under which they were bailed out if they were over budget. That is the implication of what the Deputy said. The purpose of the legislation is to provide for better planning and financial management to build a better health service.  It does not ask that agencies make their best shot at it or state that extra funds will be made available by way of a Supplementary Estimate if problems arise.  If that definition was accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My position is consistent and clear. No one was under an illusion at the meetings I had with health boards, including the one of which Deputy Shortall is a member, before the letters of determination were issued.  It was made clear that service plans should be implemented in accordance with the terms of the legislation. Because of increased resources they were in a position to provide for increased levels of activity. Leaving aside the question of whether more money should be provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the crucial question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first year in which more than £3 billion has been provided.  Because of better financial management of the economy we can plan improvements in public services next year. A total of £920 million will be available for this purpose, of which £354 million will be allocated to the health service.  The Deputy is suggesting that some of this money should be spent this year. That nullifies the purpose of the exercise.  The <Col N="106" /> service plans for 1999 will provide for these improvements.  The pay-related elements account for £200 million of the figure of £354 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that where income exceeds expenditure the excess should be spent on the provision of treatment for those in urgent need of an operation?  Income from the health levies exceeds the amount included in the 1998 Estimates.  This is under-standable because of changed conditions.  In such circumstances people find it difficult to understand that wards are being closed and patients have to wait for major surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. The health service is funded from two sources, the Exchequer grant and Appropriations-in-Aid. It has been suggested that if there is buoyancy in Appropriations-in-Aid, one is off the hook and can increase the level of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is irrelevant whether the funds are provided by way of the exchequer grant or Appropriations-in-Aid, health agencies have to operate within the authorised level of expenditure. For reasons of political mischief, the Opposition is continuing to suggest that £32 million is being held back from the health service but, as things stand, the authorised level of expenditure will be exceeded.  It is nonsense to suggest, therefore, that money is being held back, even allowing for buoyancy in Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The priorities were set at the beginning of the financial year.  Economic policy provided for a net increase in public expenditure of 4 per cent.  The Department of Health and Children was granted an increase of over 9 per cent.  It has been granted an increase of over 9.5 per cent for next year.  The reason for the increase is that I have been able to negotiate an enhanced capital programme to deliver the quality of service the people are demanding.  It is estimated, as things stand, that the £3 billion barrier will be breached this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is irrelevant whether the funding ratio is 90:10, 89:11 or 88:12 because the authorised level of expenditure remains the same for health agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a virtue out of his consistency.  Does he accept that the approach he is adopting only confirms the public's view that we have a hospital service governed by the concerns of accountants rather than of <Col N="107" /> patients?  Does he accept that there is an inconsistency in his approach to hospital budgeting and budgeting in the Department in the sense that a Supplementary Estimate is being prepared to provide for extra spending of £75 million?  The public find this difficult to swallow.  Does he accept that there is an inconsistency also in relation to the commitment in the programme for Government to tackle waiting lists?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the Minister of State who appears to think that there is no problem in patients accessing consultants at an early stage on the pathway through the acute hospital service or does he agree with me and Professor Muiris Fitzgerald, an eminent consultant, that there is a major problem which is creating difficulties for him in spending money to reduce waiting lists?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister by way of a parliamentary question regarding the level of increased hospital activity, which the Minister periodically promotes as positive, especially the increase in inpatient and day services, what proportion of that increase had been directed towards private and public patients.  It is an important question because there is a danger of a streamlined service being provided for private patients and of public patients being pushed further down the queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>First, none of the Supplementary Estimates is for my Department.  They are for drugs schemes administered by the health boards, for PRSI and superannuation overruns, etc. Second, the Deputy's view of what the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, said is different from mine.  Deputy Shortall suggested non-consultant hospital doctors were examining patients without consultant cover.  In the interaction which occurred in the House for which I was present, the Minister of State suggested there was back up in terms of senior house officers and registrars. That was his only contribution.  He did not suggest there was easy access to consultants.  He simply made the point that, in instances where non-consultant hospital doctors examine patients and must make medical decisions, a back up service is available from senior house officers and registrars when the consultant is not present.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister of State said.  What the Deputy suggested he said is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will address the point that the hospital service is being run by accountants.  I will introduce an initiative shortly to try to bring clinicians into management.  With the type of high technology hospital service available as we approach the 21st century and the regional and tertiary centres being developed around the country, a greater partnership is needed in the management process. The old hierarchical system and stereotypical view of how hospitals are run &mdash; the general surgeon <Col N="108" /> and the administrator and a case of never the twain shall meet &mdash; is an unfair assessment of how matters stand.  However, that is not to suggest we do not have a sufficiently integrated service in terms of management.  In some hospitals, such as St. James's and Cork University Hospital, I have seen multidisciplinary teams of executive management and clinical directorates working together.  That is in line with best practice and is needed throughout the hospital system as it would benefit both managers and clinicians.  The idea would be that clinicians would be in charge of budgets as well as patients.  That brings its own disciplines and challenges and both sides have their reservations.  However, everyone involved in the pilot schemes agrees it is a better system of management and that they would not revert to the old system.  That is in train and should be accelerated in the interest of good patient care, if nothing else.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the hospital service is being run by accountants for the reasons I have given and because of the thrust of our policy.  If we revert to the historical position of deficits and allow budgets for health services to become irrelevant, the logical conclusion reached &mdash; and quickly because of the costs involved &mdash; is that hospitals will not be able to deliver core services.  That is the reality if there is no reference to budgets.  I accept management of the health service is a difficult process because a huge number of personnel is involved.  We provide a very good service compared to many.  It has many problems but we will continue to work to solve them.  However, the experience of the late 1980s and up to 1993, when the historical deficits were cleared, showed that such deficits in such difficult years seriously arrested the development of the health service. This was because of the overhanging debt on health boards and the consequent debt repayments which had to be contended with.  This was at a time when health boards were already working on tight budgets and when there was less economic growth and strength.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to plan the service and successive Governments have annually increased its funding.  A significant difference in my approach is that I insist on an enhanced capital programme.  If the position is adopted that budgets do not matter in the hospital system, although they account for 52 per cent of the health budget, and it is allowed persist, with more being paid than was agreed, other services will be placed at the back of the queue, such as those for the mentally handicapped and physically disabled. If there is a finite amount of money and hospital services are <i>sui generis</i> within the system, other community based services will suffer if budgets are not adhered to because their allocated budget will be eroded.  We cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>I am trying to ensure the message is sent to all that everyone plays on the same pitch, that service plans are drawn up in line with allocations and that, on the basis of working with that <Col N="109" /> budgetary discipline, there will be an enhanced capital programme of investment in areas where historically there was none, for example, district hospitals and community-based hospitals where the elderly are cared for.  I have been in such places and many of them have not had walls painted for years.  There is a need to deal with psychiatric services and inappropriate placement in mental hospitals.  I am proud that St. Ita's in Portrane is proceeding.  We are making that a priority and providing £13 million for it to provide a service for those people.  No general hospital in the country has to contend with that. It has been a priority of the Eastern Health Board for 30 years.</P>

From 1995 to 1997 the social, progressive, left wing, flavour of the month Government of which the Deputy was a member allowed public hospital costs to increase by 13 per cent and private patients using public beds did not have to pay extra.  I increased private patient contributions by 9 per cent last year and by the same amount this year.  What effort was made by the rainbow Government to give public patients greater access to public beds?  None.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt anybody. Will the Minister accept that for health boards to stay within their budget, the budget would have to be adequate in the first place?  Will the Minister further accept that he can legally introduce a Supplementary Estimate if he had the will to do so?  I do not want rhetoric.  During Question Time yesterday the Minister acknowledged he had the £32 million and said he would not return it to the Department of Finance.  Is he aware that less than 3 per cent of that £32 million would keep two wards and a theatre open at University College Hospital, Galway, and prevent 45 nurses being laid off?  Judging by his performance here today, does the Minister intend to ride rough shod over this crisis, in the hope that it will go away, at the expense of hospital patients and those on waiting lists throughout the country?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I have since approved a total of £120 million for what will be practically a new hospital for Galway.  It is important the Deputy takes note of that because along with a capital investment comes increased revenue implications year on year which will address some of the problems he is seeking to resolve.  Because of an enhanced capital programme there will be an increased revenue stream coming into that hospital.  We will provide a greater range of services.</P>

      <P>I have three brief questions for the Minister which are inter-related.  Does the Minister accept that closing the Adelaide, Harcourt Street and Meath hospitals in my constituency of Dublin South-East was a major mistake given the demographic change and the fact that <Col N="113" /> more young families and children are living in the area?  Will he accept we need more acute hospital services in the south inner city?  Will the Minister confirm that accident and emergency admissions at Tallaght Hospital are 30 per cent ahead of the aggregate of the three hospitals to which I have just referred?  Finally, when will the Minister publish the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Tallaght Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the Deputy's last question yesterday during Question Time.  I realise the Deputy cannot be everywhere at one time.  In relation to the accident and emergency service at Tallaght, a matter raised by the Deputy earlier today, I would remind him that of the three hospitals Tallaght replaced, only the Meath Hospital provided adult accident and emergency services.  In planning for the move to Tallaght, it was estimated that adult accident and emergency attendances at Tallaght would be greater than at the Meath by up to 40 per cent.  In fact, accident and emergency attendances at Tallaght have not reached this level of increase.  Accident and emergency attendances increased by approximately 19 per cent between the opening of the accident and emergency department at Tallaght in June and the end of August.  In September and October, adult accident and emergency attendances were up by 17 to 18 per cent as against the comparable 1997 figures for the Meath Hospital.  Significant additional resources have been supplied for accident and emergency services at Tallaght, including the most modern X-ray facilities in Europe, on-site laboratory facilities which were not available at the Meath Hospital, additional staffing and the newest accident and emergency department in the country.  Accident and emergency admissions at Tallaght show an increase over the rate of admissions at the Meath, but these admissions are still at a rate below that of other comparable hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, since the move to Tallaght, 35 non-acute beds have been provided for the exclusive use of Tallaght at the old Meath Hospital.  These beds are provided by the Eastern Health Board and do not impact on the resources of the hospital in Tallaght.  I do not agree that the move should not have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, in the context of his acknowledging that there has been a dramatic increase in the waiting lists, that closing 912 beds in December at a loss over the next six weeks of 16,000 bed days makes no economic sense and, in the context of patient care, is indicative of a lack of insight into the needs of patients? Will he confirm that when it comes to bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the House, the Minister, at his discretion, has available to him the possibility of making whatever financial decisions are necessary in the context of what he <Col N="114" /> regards as an essential priority?  Will he acknowledge it is an essential priority to keep these beds open in December in the context of the estimated waiting list at the end of the year being in the region of 38,000 patients?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to the central question about the adequacy of the allocation.  In a time of major economic buoyancy we are simply not spending enough on our health services. What is the Minister's view of the fact that we are close to the bottom of the EU league in terms of spending on health as a percentage of GDP?  This is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister still intent on closing two wards in University College Hospital, Galway and, following the breakdown in talks yesterday, is he aware that administrative and management staff will force patients out of St. Mary's and St. Pius's Wards and transfer them to other overcrowded wards?  Does he intend to allow a spectacle never before seen in the country to develop?  In view of the ongoing negotiations in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, will the Minister recommend that the Western Health Board take over that hospital?  Will he comment on these matters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the expression &ldquo;we can plan&rdquo; and I presume he is planning for 1999.  In the Mid-Western Health Board region the waiting list for ophthalmic treatment has increased and an application has been made to the Minister for an increase in theatre costs associated with the three ophthalmic surgeons. Do the Minister's plans include one to bring this list under control in 1999?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Shatter's point, one way to bring about greater efficiency would be to deal with the 150,000 bed-days where there are inappropriate placements.  This would give us the opportunity of dealing with some of the problems being discussed today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister not deal <Col N="115" /> with that problem?  Why are there empty nursing homes?  The Minister should resign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

While I appreciate that the suggestion was made in a constructive spirit and I do not dismiss it out of hand, it has some important drawbacks which have received insufficient attention.  One need only recall how routinely economic forecasts are shown to be inaccurate to realise that economic growth is difficult to predict over the medium term.  Variations in economic growth would lead directly to swings in the level of resources devoted to health over a number of years.  If health spending is pegged as a proportion of GDP, what plans do the Opposition have to avoid serious dislocation of services during a downward economic cycle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Department of Agriculture and Food makes up the rules as it goes along.  This environmental scheme came like a bolt from the blue.  It is widely believed that many hills are over-grazed but this scheme is a very blunt instrument.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not here this evening to hear what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The scheme applies to hill sheep farmers but a number of lowland sheep farmers received letters this week telling them they too must dispose of their flocks.  Farmers are being asked to shed 30 per cent of cull ewes.  Many of these ewes have been in lamb for some considerable time and it is most insensitive to ask farmers to kill ewes when they are heavy in lamb.  Why did the Department not announce this scheme six or eight weeks ago?</P>
    <P>Next year, under the framework programme, it will be authoritatively decided whether each hill is overgrazed and farmers will be told exactly what stock they may carry.  The Minister has given an undertaking that farmers who are obliged to cull 30 per cent of their ewes under the current hill ewe scheme will be allowed to increase their stock if next year's framework programme decides they may carry a larger stock.  However, I do not think any farmer will ever see the return of a quota once it has been lost.</P>
    <P>A grant of £10 is being made available for every carcase condemned by veterinary inspectors at the factories.  Once more, factories will make most from this arrangement.  Factories will receive £3 for killing each ewe categorised as a boning-out ewe and farmers will receive the commercial value of the carcase.  Most farmers will want their carcases to be placed in the condemned category rather than in the boning-out category.</P>
    <P>The 30 per cent figure is based on the 1998 quota for hill sheep farmers.  I was briefed on this matter by the Department on Tuesday.  However, I read in today's <i>Farmers' Journal</i> that the Department is changing the ground again.  It is now saying that if some sheep were sold in the intervening period between the time one received the quota in 1998 and now, that will be taken into account.  I accept that, but farmers cannot expect that this is the final word on the matter.  It is obvious that the Department is changing its mind every day.</P>
    <P>We talk about environmental purpose and I am as much an environmentalist as anybody else, but there is a price for all this.  A farmer in Tour-makeady, County Mayo, in County Kerry or anywhere else with 300 ewes who has built up his flock and handling facilities will lose 100 sheep in the coming weeks.  He will receive £10 each for them and the remaining 70 per cent, so he will get £2,000.  Next year, however, he will lose the ewe premium, which is worth £20 a head and £10 headage on the 100 ewes that have gone.  Therefore, he stands to lose £3,000 every year.  He cannot be too happy about that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, or Deputy Healy-Rae in County Kerry will handle this matter.  Someone should get back to the Minister for Agriculture and Food about those issues, however, because the hill sheep farmers are not happy.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this matter.  I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced last week that interim arrangements had been agreed between their respective Departments to put a national framework plan in place for commonage areas.</P>
      <P>This measure is necessary to address the problem of commonage areas which have become degraded because of overgrazing by sheep.  This interim plan is being put in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans and will incorporate the main environmental measures in the agri-environmental programme already agreed with the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Under the national interim plan ewe premium quota rights of farmers with any commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry will be reduced by 30 per cent from 1998 levels.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this measure, farmers who farm commonage land will be able to apply under the new rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, which provides for an annual payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres.  These enhanced payments will be available to any farmer with commonage wishing to join REPS and indeed to farmers with commonage already participating in REPS.  The average payment for an existing REPS participant with 80 acres of commonage will increase from £4,960 to £6,400 annually.  The maximum payable will increase from £6,200 to £9,400 annually.  An alternative compensation scheme will be made available by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for farmers who do not wish to join REPS.  Application forms for the new REPS measure may be obtained from the Department of Agriculture and Food's local offices where copies of the revised scheme document and specification will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>All sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry on their 1998 area aid application have been identified and have been written to by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  They are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  Arrangements have been made with the meat export slaughter plants to dispose of the ewes concerned between now and 4 December at no cost to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1999 ewe premium entitlement of the farmers concerned will be limited to 70 per cent of their 1998 quota and 1999 sheep headage entitlement will be limited to 70 per cent of the 1998 entitlement.  The farmers concerned are <Col N="118" /> already entitled to a payment of up to £300 under the winter fodder scheme for farmers with mountain breeding ewes.</P>
    <P>In order to assist sheep farmers who are subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quota, the Minister for Agriculture and Food is now making arrangements to pay an additional £10 per ewe on the 70 per cent balance of their quota.  It is expected that all of these payments will be made during December.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of this measure together with weather related schemes announced earlier will be £18.75 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I speak on behalf of a substantial group of people, about 12,000 in all, who must rank as the most exploited section of workers in this State.  A majority, if not all of them, are female workers.  I refer to home helps employed by health boards.  In all health boards, without exception, pay levels for home helps are scandalously inadequate.  The Southern Health Board, however, pays the most shameful rates of all.  That health board now pays its home helps £2 an hour, up a glorious 30p from the £1.70 of one year ago.  Even that epitome of exploitation, the multinational hamburger peddlers McDonalds, who are infamous for their low rates of pay, would blush at these rates.</P>
      <P>Home helps provide an essential service to people in acute need in a great diversity of ways, yet along with exploitation wages, they receive no holiday pay and no sick leave.  Sometimes, they have to travel miles at their own expense to their patients.  Home helps deal with patients who would otherwise be institutionalised.  Many of the people they care for are sick and disabled or elderly and enfeebled.  One example was drawn to my attention of a young woman with small children who was seriously ill.  Her husband goes to work for a low wage.  The home help gets the children out to school and then does the washing and cleaning.  She cares for the ill woman but if that patient is taken into hospital for a period the home help receives no pay.  That leaves her and the family in a situation of emotional trauma.</P>
      <P>Families and home helps get close to each other emotionally.  Thus, the home help is put under emotional blackmail by this scheme to work for free because she does not want to see the family suffering even more.  Home helps are homemakers, cooks, dishwashers, child-minders, nurses, counsellors and much more.  All that for £2 an hour.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, who was in the House a few minutes ago did not remain to deal with this Adjournment matter.  A year ago in the House, he described the home help service as &ldquo;a community based good neighbour scheme which attracts people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This trick was used for generations to blackmail <Col N="119" /> general nurses.  They were called angels of mercy who were always to be there when needed, but they were grievously exploited.  They are still angels of mercy but now they are recognised as crucial professional workers who are beginning to receive pay rates accordingly.</P>
    <P>Like nurses, home helps are not an optional extra.  They are a crucially necessary part of health care, which is not something that can be left to chance, as the Minister seems to think.  If home helps were not there, the institutional care they provide would still be necessary and would be massively more expensive, thus making the hospital waiting list crisis far worse.</P>
    <P>I extend my solidarity to home helps around the country, particularly in the Southern Health Board region.  Home helps as a group, spearheaded by the Cork home helps, have launched and are vigorously pursuing a campaign for just rates of pay, conditions and recognition of the crucial role they play.  Public representatives, be they councillors or Deputies, who have gone along with this shameful exploitation should hang their heads in shame.  We must end this shameful exploitation by recognising home helps for the crucial service they give and the angels of mercy and the carers they are.  They should receive a minimum of £6 per hour and their roles should be fully recognised as an essential component of the health service. I hope the Minister of State will recognise this and begin to put the situation right.</P>

      <P>The home help service is widely recognised as a key service in supporting dependent people in their homes. However, it is generally accepted that there are a number of problems relating to the organisation and development of home help services which need to be addressed to realise the full potential of this service.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Ireland, under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be submitted to me and published shortly.  It is my intention that the recommendations of the report will be fully considered with a view to early implementation.</P>
      <P>Although not within the terms of this study, I understand the question of payments to home helps has been referred to.  I acknowledge that the system of remuneration of home helps, both in relation to the rates of payment and standardisation across health boards, needs to be addressed. My Department is currently examining how this might be achieved in the context of the availability of resources.  Due regard will also be given to the recommendations of the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential repairs grant scheme as operated by Kildare County Council deprives people of payments if the grant is sought for repairs to kitchens and bathrooms with flat roofs. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Houses, especially rural houses, in the 1950s and 1960s did not have toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities.  This problem was overcome when families built kitchens which, in almost all cases, had flat roofs.  These roofs are now causing major problems as they leak and are in poor condition. In almost all cases, these houses are occupied by the elderly who cannot afford to make repairs.</P>
      <P>These people cannot use vital facilities such as bathrooms, toilets or kitchens.  The idea was that such facilities would be provided for them but the council is saying the opposite.  It is claiming that the essential repairs grant cannot be paid and they must move back into the original house.  This is a joke.  These people have no money to make their houses habitable yet they are being refused a miserly £2,000 to rectify the problems so that they could use their houses for the rest of their lives.  They are living in deplorable conditions.  In one instance, an old age pensioner is living with a 36 year old mentally handicapped son.  They cannot use the toilet as the roof is falling in.  The council says it cannot give an essential repairs grant in this case.  Another pensioner has to sweep rain water on to the street through the front door.  This suffering is taking place despite the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
      <P>In this time of economic boom, I appeal to the Minister of State to instruct that such repairs be carried out under the essential repairs grant scheme.  We are not talking about a large amount of money &mdash; £2,000.  In almost all cases, that money would cover the cost of the repairs necessary. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should instruct local authorities to issue grants to these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue.  The essential repairs grant scheme is a long established social housing option.  It is a modest but very worthwhile measure as it enables people in accommodation which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic repairs carried out to their houses so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.  The scheme is generally used to secure essential repairs to dwellings occupied by elderly persons, often in isolated rural areas and, in 1997, local authorities paid out 896 grants to the value of more than £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is administered entirely by local authorities within the policy framework set out in the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993.  My Department's main role in the scheme is to provide financial assistance in respect of grants paid.  Half of <Col N="121" /> each grant paid by local authorities is recouped by my Department subject to a maximum recoupment of £900 in each case.</P>
    <P>Essential repairs grants may, in accordance with the statutory regulations, be paid where: the occupier is approved for local authority housing; the house cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost but the repairs proposed will prolong the useful life of the house; there would be no continuing demand for local authority housing at the location of the house in respect of which a grant is paid.</P>
    <P>The grant by the local authority may be the full approved cost of the repairs, subject to a maximum, which is adjusted in line with the house building cost index, and currently stands at more than £5,500.</P>
    <P>The structure under which the scheme operates confers a degree of flexibility on local authorities to enable them to deal appropriately with individual applications in the light of local circumstances. In view of the nature of the scheme, the best interests of grant applicants may not be served by an undue level of uniformity in its operation. Successive Governments have pursued a policy of devolving appropriate functions to local authorities.  Real devolution means handing over responsibility for decision making.  The essential repairs grant scheme which is devolved to the authorities, requires local authorities to take and be accountable for their decisions.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Deputy Wall has a particular concern about whether an essential repairs grant may be paid in respect of repairs to flat roof extensions to houses.  I confirm that the statutory regulations would not, in general, preclude the payment of a grant in respect of the repair of a flat roofed extension to a house and I suggest that he take up the matter with Kildare County Council on this basis.  In the circumstances, I will also have my Department make contact with the council in this aspect of its operation of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  My request is straightforward, that the Government amend the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, to ring-fence moneys seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau for areas worst affected by the drugs epidemic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I asked some weeks ago, the Minister informed me that in excess of £8 million has been seized since the legislation to establish the Criminal Assets Bureau came into effect in 1996.  There is a five year injunction on the spending of that money by the courts.  If £8 million has already been secured following the implementation of that legislation, there can be no doubt that the sums seized will continue to grow.  When the injunction ceases to apply in 2003, the Government will be able to tap into a considerable resource as a result of the <Col N="122" /> establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It is unfortunate that the money is frozen until then.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government to ring-fence the moneys which the State has succeeded in clawing back from crime bosses and drug traffickers to benefit the communities worst affected by the drugs problem.  It would have been preferable if, when the proceeds of crime legislation was going through the Houses, a provision was included to provide that the moneys seized be vested either in the Cabinet sub-committee on social exclusion or in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation rather than in the Department of Finance. The Minister will be aware that moneys in the Department of Finance can sometimes get lost in a type of financial black hole.  It is crucial that in this case the moneys are ring-fenced for the communities which are worst affected by the drugs epidemic.</P>
    <P>No greater success could emerge from this endeavour than if it is explained to these communities that the moneys seized from the godfathers of crime by the Criminal Assets Bureau will be returned to them.  The money can be used to build community projects and facilities in their areas.  We should loudly boast that the money which was stripped from those areas for too long will be redirected back to them from the pockets of the godfathers of crime.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply.  I hope he will be constructive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau was established in 1996 as part of an overall Government response to the problem of drugs and organised crime.  The bureau is a multiagency statutory body that draws its staff from members of the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>In the relatively short time it has been in existence, the outstanding performance and success of the Criminal Assets Bureau is hard evidence of what can be achieved when governments and statutory agencies put their heads together in a determined manner to hit the drugs barons and other serious criminals where it hurts most &mdash; in their pockets, bank accounts, fancy houses and fast cars.  The bureau's use of the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, has been most effective to date.  At this point it might be useful to reflect on the primary features of the 1996 Act which empower the High Court to make an interim order freezing property for 21 days, an interlocutory order freezing property for up to seven years and a disposal order once the property has been frozen for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of these provisions as applied by the Criminal Assets Bureau can be clearly seen. For the period from 15 October 1996 to 31 December 1996, the bureau obtained six interim orders to the value of £2.1 million and five interlocutory orders to the value of £2 million.  In 1997 the bureau obtained 22 interim orders to the <Col N="123" /> value of £2.3 million and 13 interlocutory orders to the value of £1.5 million.  The bureau has also demanded tax with interest in the amount of £8.65 million and has made a number of social welfare determinations resulting in overpayments assessed in the amount of £0.219 million.</P>
    <P>If and when a disposal order is made, the property or the proceeds of disposing of the property will be vested in the Minister for Finance to be realised for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Accordingly, the Minister has no discretion in the use of any funds transferred to him under this Act. Therefore, while the case made by the Deputy is worthy in terms of the visual impact of such a gesture, it would be contrary to standard public accounting procedures to transfer particular revenues to particular purposes.  All revenues are taken in by the Exchequer and such allocations as are necessary are made through the normal Estimates process.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that any funds that are necessary for dealing with the drugs problem in areas such as those referred to by the Deputy will be provided for in the normal way through the relevant Votes.  If the approach suggested by the Deputy was adopted, it would mean that the treatment of victims of the drug problem would be financed, in part at least, by uncertain and variable revenue sources.  In addition, under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, it could be up to seven years from the time that illegal assets are seized before any funds are transferred to the Exchequer.  Therefore, I firmly believe that current Government policy for dealing with the drugs problem, funded through the normal channels, is the correct way to proceed.</P>
    <P>This policy is essentially a two-pronged approach to deal with both supply and demand. On the one side, there are tough enforcement measures backed up by the necessary legislative requirements, for example, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the operations of the Garda national drugs unit and operations Dóchas, Mainstreet and Cleanstreet.  On the other side, there is a multi-agency response to deal with the demand element of the problem.  This two-pronged approach is vital since efforts to cut the supply of drugs which are not backed up by measures to address the reasons people become addicted in the first place will ultimately prove futile.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the Government has <Col N="124" /> adopted an integrated and co-ordinated approach to tackling all aspects of the problem.  This involves the combined efforts of statutory agencies and community and voluntary groups.  One of the most encouraging aspects of this strategy has been the emergence of these groups as a real force in dealing with the drug problem in their own areas.  Their efforts and dedication are now being fully recognised and supported by the Government and statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>Local drug task forces have been established in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  These task forces represent a new partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors. These groups are supported by flexible, responsive structures at central level which include a Cabinet committee on drugs and social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach and of which I am a member, and a national drugs strategy team comprising key personnel from my Department, the Garda Síochána and other relevant Departments, statutory agencies and community and voluntary groups.  Of course, and this is of direct relevance to the issue raised by the Deputy, these new structures are underpinned by the commitment of the necessary financial resources.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved funding of £10 million to support the implementation of the service development plans which have been drawn up by the task forces, and this is currently under way.  Another reflection of the Government's commitment to tackling the problem is the young people's facilities and services fund under which £30 million has been allocated to support the development of a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas, in particular, those areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  This is hard evidence of the Government's commitment to providing the necessary resources to deal with the scourge of drugs in our communities.</P>
    <P>While the sentiments behind the Deputy's proposal are worthwhile, the current structures to fund the Government's anti-drug policy are working.  I assure the Deputy and everybody else concerned with this problem of my total commitment to ensuring that everything possible is done to ensure the success of the policies we are pursuing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the article referred to which claims that Ireland will face a substantial bill to purchase carbon credits in order to meet our Kyoto target.  Ireland's position, in common with the EU, is that emissions trading should be supplemental to domestic action as the main means by which parties will meet their targets.  It is not possible to estimate at this stage whether, and to what extent, Ireland will be a participant in the trading market, and at what price emissions will be traded.</P>
      <P>The article in question appears to assume that no action beyond business as usual will be taken at domestic and EU levels to meet Kyoto targets and, to this extent, its cost estimates cannot be regarded as reliable.  I am developing a national strategy to meet our target in the most economically and environmentally advantageous manner, including by intensification of existing policies and measures and the identification of new policies and measures.  As part of this process, I am also establishing an advisory group to examine greenhouse gas emissions trading, to advise on the options for Ireland, both domestically and in the context of developing EU and international requirements, and to offer advice towards the Irish negotiating position on international trading as required.</P>
      <P>In relation to Ireland's current levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the strategy to limit future emissions, I refer to the reply to Priority Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23, 26 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Growth in transport demand in recent years, which has closely followed economic performance, has resulted in increased peak hour congestion in the major urban centres.  Outside Dublin, problems of urban traffic congestion are being addressed primarily by the local authorities concerned in association with other relevant agencies. Funding has been approved, under the technical assistance programme of the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99, for land use and transportation studies in Galway and Limerick with a view to guiding appropriate strategies and solutions.  Consideration will also be given in the context of the next national development plan to the transport investment needs of major urban centres.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, the Dublin Transportation Office has recently published a transportation review and short-term action plan to respond to the growth in traffic in the area in advance of the completion of the major DTI infrastructural projects such as the Luas, the port tunnel and the remaining elements of the C-ring.  The action plan is designed to accelerate the implementation of those elements of the DTI strategy which can be completed in the period up to end 2000.  Accordingly, it focuses on public transport enhancement, traffic management, parking policy and the provision of cycling facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has endorsed early implementation of a wide range of measures in the action plan.  These include accelerated implementation of the original 11 route QBC network and the provision of a QBC serving Ballymun; provision <Col N="128" /> of increased capacity in the Dublin Bus service through fleet additions &mdash; 150 new buses will be provided giving increased capacity of 9,450 passenger trips; scrapping of 70 old single deck and 50 old double deck buses and their replacement by 120 new double deck buses, increasing capacity by 2,450 passenger trips; provision of additional rolling stock for DART, 8x2 railcar sets, while CIE has 10 DART railcars on order for delivery in 1999 &mdash; the new rolling stock will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, along the DART extensions to Malahide and Greystones which will be operational in 1999; lengthening of 12 outer suburban and key DART station platforms; upgrading of the Maynooth to Clonsilla rail line; and substantial completion of the Dublin cycle route network &mdash; a further 100 kilometres will be provided.</P>
    <P>Following the success of operation freeflow in previous years, I will launch, with ministerial colleagues next week, an enhanced operation freeflow for the Christmas and new year period.  For the longer term, the DTO has begun the process of updating the original DTI strategy.  This will lead to the publication of a revised and updated strategy for the period 2000 to 2016 and a detailed investment and implementation programme for the period 2000 to 2006.  The intention is to complete this updating work by end 1999, with an interim report not later than mid-1999 to assist the preparation of the new national development plan.</P>
    <P>In the context of the mid-term review of the current community support framework, it was agreed at the request of the European Commission that a study of road pricing and related issues should be carried out with reference to the Dublin area.  This study is now under way and is expected to be completed early next year.  The conclusions of the study will be taken into account in the ongoing development of transport policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the reference of the gazumping issue to the Law Reform Commission, I refer to <Col N="129" /> Priority Question No. 4 on today's order paper. As recommended in the Bacon report and accepted by the Government in &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo;, I raised the question of formulating a code of practice to deal with gazumping with the Irish Home Builders Association. The response of the association has been positive and I understand that they hope to be in a position to finalise and formally approve the code shortly.  I will continue to pursue the matter with a view to ensuring the early implementation of an effective code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Comprehensive information on house prices for the first half of 1998 in Dublin and the rest of the country is contained in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the June quarter, 1998, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Preliminary figures for the September quarter to be published in the next few weeks suggest a significant slow down in the rate of new house price increases.  The rate of increase in new house prices has reduced in the Dublin area from 10.6 per cent in the June quarter to less than 3 per cent in the September quarter and, for the country as a whole, from 4.7 per cent to less than 2 per cent between the same two quarters.  The rate of increase in second hand house prices has also reduced but to a lesser extent &mdash; in the Dublin area from 13.3 per cent to about 10 per cent and, for the country as a whole, from 11 per cent to about 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority in the Government's Action on House Prices was to curb overheating in the housing market while, at the same time, putting in place measures to ensure an adequate supply of housing into the medium and long term.  It will take time for some of the measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, to have full effect.  However, apart from the figures I have quoted there are other indications that the measures taken to curb overheating are having a positive impact.  For example, market sources also report some easing of the house prices situation, that investors are no longer pricing first time buyers out of the market and that the number of secondhand houses on the market has increased following the significant reductions in stamp duty rates on the sale of existing houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority in the period ahead is to maximise the supply of housing.  That is essential to meet the unprecedented increase in demand, which is the principal underlying factor in house price <Col N="130" /> increases.  Considerable progress is already being made in increasing housing output.  The record level of housing output in 1997 is expected to be surpassed again this year, with completions likely to exceed 40,000.  The measures in Action on House Prices are designed to secure the continuation of this trend and alleviate bottlenecks or constraints on housing supply.  In particular, the significant additional Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure to open up extra land for housing should yield in the region of an additional 100,000 housing sites over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Increased residential densities is a further key element in the Government's strategy to increase housing supply.  Planning authorities have been advised to promote higher residential densities at appropriate locations.  Consultants have been engaged to undertake a study and prepare draft guidelines on housing density which will be published early in the new year in draft for full public consultation.  The reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for the next four years to encourage faster sales of land for housing development is also helping to increase the supply of land for housing.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the Government's Action on House Prices and monitoring of its effects is a priority for my Department in order to ensure that all measures have maximum impact as quickly as possible.  I have no proposals to attempt to impose artificial administrative controls on the price of houses which would, in practice, prove inappropriate and ineffective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also responsible in so far as activities <Col N="131" /> licensible by the agency are concerned, and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes and the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment.</P>
    <P>The EPA water quality report for 1991-1994 indicates that the bulk of Irish surface waters are of good quality.  The report draws attention, however, to a growing tendency towards eutrophication, that is, the enrichment of waters beyond natural levels by nutrients, mainly phosphorous. While inputs from sewage and, to a lesser extent, industry contribute to this, discharges from diffuse agricultural sources are largely responsible for the upward trend, overall, in the incidence of slight and moderate pollution.  Phosphorus losses from agriculture come from farmyards where waste management practices are inadequate and from leaching and run-off from land, particularly following the spreading of slurries or the use of chemical fertilisers containing phosphorus.</P>
    <P>My Department's catchment based strategy against eutrophication, launched in May 1997, provides a clearer focus on, and a more systematic approach to, the problem of eutrophication caused by phosphorus inputs to waters.  Several actions have been taken at national level as part of the overall strategy to reduce inputs of phosphorus to our waters.  My Department is financing major investment by local authorities to upgrade sewerage networks and waste water treatment facilities throughout the country.  This investment programme is substantially supported by the EU Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>A code of good agricultural practice was launched in 1996 to protect waters from pollution. As part of the ongoing implementation of the strategy, I made regulations last July prescribing statutory standards for phosphorus in rivers and lakes.  In August, the Department issued guidelines for nutrient management planning on farms. The development of a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association to reduce the amount of phosphorus in household detergents is also at an advanced stage. I am committed to the full implementation of the measures for which I am responsible in the strategy.</P>
    <P>In regard to Lough Derg and Lough Ree, current data indicate that both lakes are eutrophic. A catchment monitoring and management system is being developed over a three year period for these lakes.  Expenditure on the project, which is due for completion in July, 2000, will be approximately £2.3 million, and 85 per cent co-financing is being provided by the European Union Cohesion Fund.  An interim report on this project, which was published in September 1998, outlines progress during the first year.  The report describes water quality status and proposes water quality objectives for the rivers and lakes, and key environmental indicators against which progress may be gauged.  It is primarily intended as <Col N="132" /> a consultative document that will provide a firm basis for ongoing participation by interested parties towards the development of the monitoring and management system.</P>
    <P>The project provides a mechanism to implement, in relation to Lough Derg and Lough Ree, the catchment based national strategy to which I have already referred.  A substantial programme of investment is also under way in the catchment to upgrade sanitary services facilities. Applications for Cohesion Fund assistance for an integrated catchment protection scheme for Lough Derg and Lough Ree were submitted to the EU Commission in 1994.  Stage I of these projects, as approved by the Commission, provides for the planning and/or construction of improved sewerage schemes at 17 locations in the lake catchments at Ballinasloe, Birr, Moate, Tullamore, Roscrea, Nenagh, Portumna, Monksland and Athlone, west bank and Clara in the Lough Derg catchment and at Ballyjamesduff, Roscommon, Boyle, Ballaghdereen, Ballymahon, Granard and Longford in the Lough Ree catchment. Work, which includes the provision of phosphate removal facilities where necessary, has been substantially completed on a number of these schemes and is continuing on the planning/construction of the remainder.  Work is also continuing on Banagher and Dromod sewerage schemes which were not included in the Cohesion Fund approval.</P>
    <P>I also refer to the reply to Question No. 51 of 13 October 1998.</P>

      <P>I am assessing how best to fulfil the Government's commitment to the establishment of an Irish eco label with due <Col N="133" /> regard to developments on the issue at European level.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has presented proposals to amend the European Eco label scheme &mdash; Council Regulation 880/92 &mdash; and streamline its operational procedures.  These proposals are currently being discussed by EU member states. Key objectives of the Commission proposals include the prioritisation of product groups which are widely traded in the EU market and measures to minimise variation in criteria and labels for the same products across the EU.  Taking account of the ongoing developments on these proposals, I will be asking Comhar, the new National Sustainable Development Partnership, on its establishment shortly, to consider and report to me on the options for and best approach to eco labelling in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, good progress is being made, under the existing EU scheme, in increasing the number of product groups for which ecological criteria are set.  To date, criteria have been agreed for 13 product groups and over 200 products across the Community &mdash; including in Ireland &mdash; carry the label.  In the coming months, my Department, in collaboration with the European Commission and NSAI, the competent body for eco labelling in Ireland, will be undertaking promotional measures to increase awareness of eco labelling amongst producers, consumers and the general public.</P>

The 1999 baseline amounts were also increased to take full account of changes in the treatment of the proceeds of pre-1993 house sales schemes which will arise in 1999; these proceeds will be fully available for capital purposes from 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocations in recent years have included an initial and preliminary attempt at equalisation. A pilot study into the needs and resources of local authorities is at present being conducted by Galway County Council in conjunction with my Department.  It is intended that this study, which is planned for completion in mid-1999, will <Col N="134" /> produce a model that will be capable of application to all local authorities and will provide a more objective distribution of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also responsible in so far as activities licensable by the agency are concerned and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes, and for the creation and maintenance of databases of information on the environment.</P>
      <P>The EPA water quality report for 1991-94 indicates that the bulk of Irish surface waters are of good quality.  The report draws attention to a growing tendency towards eutrophication, that is, the enrichment of waters beyond natural levels by nutrients, mainly phosphorous.  The EPA, which will publish an updated report this year, identifies the main sources of pollution by phosphorous as agriculture, sewage discharges and discharges from industry.  In 1997, my Department published a comprehensive national strategy &mdash;<i>Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes</i>&mdash; to tackle eutrophication.  A copy is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It is a matter for the relevant local authorities to identify the sources of water pollution in their particular areas and to initiate appropriate remedial action.</P>
      <P>A major investment programme is under way to improve sewage treatment and collection facilities. Since 1994, over £258 million has been spent on major public sewerage schemes.  A further £185 million has been provided in my Department's 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme which, <i>inter alia,</i> will fund the improvement and expansion of sewage treatment and collection infrastructure.  The programme will be significantly expanded in 1999 as a result of the capital provision of £268 million included in my Departments Estimates for 1999 &mdash; an increase of 45 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the record levels of funding and the commencement of management, monitoring and infrastructural investment programmes at the level of the major river and lake catchments, I am satisfied that the threat of pollution to surface <Col N="135" /> waters from sewage discharges is being vigorously and systematically tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of workplace health and safety, including construction site safety, is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 clearly sets out the duties and responsibilities of both employers and employees in relation to the provision and maintenance of a safe working environment.  This Act applies to all places of work and to all employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Construction Regulations implement a European Union directive specifically addressing safety and health standards on construction sites.  These regulations constitute one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one sector.  They introduce the concept of a chain of responsibility thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion, and they place very specific obligations on all the participants, that is, clients, designers, contractors, employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Legislation, however, needs to be enforced in a targeted and structured manner if it is to be really effective in improving safety standards. Earlier this summer, I launched a new Construction Action Programme, drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority, which is the State body responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of health and safety legislation.  Under this programme a dedicated team of construction inspectors has been set up within the authority.  This team is now operational and the inspectors have been targeting unsafe building sites.  I have also written to all my Government colleagues asking them to ensure that where public sector construction contracts are being awarded, the firm or contractor in question has a safety statement, as required under the 1989 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority's Advisory Committee on Construction Safety &mdash; on which the key players in the construction industry are represented &mdash; is also actively seeking to improve safety standards in the sector.  It has produced a code of practice and video on safe work with scaffolding which will be launched shortly.  It is also in the process of establishing sub-groups to consider the whole <Col N="136" /> issue of consultation in the construction industry and to draw up improved guidelines for clients on their responsibilities for safety on their sites.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also met with trade union and employer representative bodies in order to discuss my concerns on construction site safety. At these meetings, both sides outlined to me the extent of the activities which they have undertaken to improve safety standards.  What I have emphasised to all concerned is that I would like to see a stronger promotion at individual site level of the approach to safety which is espoused by the national representative bodies of the social partners.</P>
    <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally good legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety.  It is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority and is complemented by the commitment and activities of the social partners.  It is through this continued commitment from all sides that we can bring about real improvements in safety standards.</P>

      <P>I recently met a number of multiples to discuss <Col N="137" /> the growing concern among consumers at the perceived failure of the retail trade to reduce the price of meat on the shelves to reflect the historically low prices paid to farmers.</P>
      <P>I made it clear to the multiples that the Government is particularly concerned about unnecessarily high meat prices on supermarket shelves.  Profiteering at any point in the supply chain, either at retail level or at the processing stage, is wholly unacceptable to me as Minister for Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>I also made it clear that the multiples must move quickly to restore consumer confidence in the value they are getting for meat and demonstrate clearly that they are pushing prices down.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the multiples stated that prices had come down to some extent.  I said I would be monitoring the situation very closely to see tangible proof that prices were on the way down. The bottom line is that the customer is entitled to consistent and lasting reductions in prices in the current environment.</P>
      <P>As regards price control, it is Government policy to encourage competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers.  I had already drawn the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement to a recent debate in this House on the issue of food prices and I have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am raising the role of the processing sector with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I will be exploring with him the extent to which the processing sector can play a role in ensuring a fair deal for consumers.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has in relation to reducing the cost of public liability and employers' liability insurance for small and micro businesses; and her views on the importance of doing this to curb the black economy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland found that smaller companies, in general, pay higher premiums for liability insurance cover.  Insurers calculate liability premium rates on the basis of their underwriting experience of business firms and the level of risk represented by different classes of business.  In that regard, small firms are perceived by insurers as lacking sophisticated safety management procedures and as representing a higher risk class than larger firms. Smaller firms are therefore charged higher premium rates for employers liability and public liability cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address this insurance cost problem for small companies and its contributory causes, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended that <Col N="138" /> small businesses should join affinity groups to strengthen their collective bargaining power with insurers and that they should seek to improve their risk management procedures through greater awareness of and compliance with health and safety standards.  A number of special affinity schemes have already been successfully established by, among others, the Small Firms Association of IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation and by publican, restaurateur and farmer groups.  A new affinity scheme for the services and self-employed sector of ISME was launched in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition to affinity schemes for purchasing insurance cover, I recently launched a voluntary code of practice aimed at reducing the cost burden, including insurance costs, of injuries in the workplace which has been developed by a workplace safety group representative of, among others, IBEC, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and the insurance division of my Department.  The object of the safe working and accident prevention code is to seek to ensure that injuries, where they occur in the workplace, are dealt with in the best way possible by management and that the employee is given every assistance and encouragement to return to work.</P>
    <P>Voluntary participation in the code of practice commits the employers to: make safety an integral part of their business operations and make accident prevention a top priority; develop a safety culture through a partnership approach and with employee involvement; consult with employees and safety representatives on health and safety arrangements; provide, either through internal or external advice, requisite competence and appropriate health and safety training for all levels of employees, both on the job training and general health and safety training.  Where appropriate, have information on hazardous substances, including material safety data sheet; provide a safety statement and ensure implementation though communication with all staff.</P>
    <P>For their part the participating employees undertake to: exercise care for their safety and that of others through their actions and safe work practices; participate in safety measures including safety training; use their initiative and take a responsible approach to accident prevention in their workplace; support the safety policy and familiarise themselves with the company safety statement and the arrangements, information and procedures therein; and co-operate with safety arrangements.  The common objective for employer and employee is to address health and safety matters in a non-adversarial climate of consultation and partnership.</P>
    <P>As the representative association for employers liability insurers in Ireland, the Irish Insurance Federation has indicated its full support for the voluntary code of practice.  It particularly supports the co-operative approach proposed which recognises the shared responsibilities of employers and employees.  The adoption of the code of practice is seen by the Irish Insurance <Col N="139" /> Federation as a very positive step in building a safety culture in the workplace and it envisages that compliance with the provisions of the code on accident prevention, accident investigation and treatment of occupational injuries will help to reduce the frequency of accidents in the workplace. This, in turn, will help to control the costs, including insurance costs, associated with accidents at work with resulting benefits to employers in the calculation of liability premium rates.</P>
    <P>I regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice in safe working and accident prevention as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace and the related cost of liability insurance cover.  With regard to the black economy impact, the high cost of employers liability premiums for small firms is not necessarily an incentive to engage in the black economy as employers liability insurance is not compulsory. The major benefit of reducing the cost burden, including insurance costs, on small businesses of accidents in the workplace will be to reduce overall labour costs and thus make it economically efficient for employers to increase employment levels.</P>

      <P>Community employment is the main manpower intervention in respect of those who are long-term unemployed and others who are experiencing difficulty in accessing the labour market.  Its objective is to provide temporary part-time work experience and training that would enhance their prospects of obtaining a job in the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since April 1996 the programme has consisted of the following two distinct options.  The part-time integration option, 30,000 places, is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining a job would be enhanced by participation on the programme.  Under this option participants are generally engaged for a 12 month period.  However up to 10 per cent of participants may be granted an extension for a further period provided such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available, <Col N="140" /> or where the participants employment prospects would be enhanced by an additional period on the programme.  The option is open to: those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit (UB) or unemployment assistance (UA) for at least 12 months; those over 21 years and on one parent family payment (OPFP) for over 12 months; and special categories such as those referred by the NRB or travellers on the live register or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>The part-time job option, 11,000 places, is aimed at older long-term unemployed people with fewer employment prospects, i.e. those over 35 years and more than three years unemployed. These participants have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, but may have their contract renewed for up to three years.  The option is open to: those over 35 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA) or unemployment benefit (UB) for over three years; those over 35 years and on one parent family payment (OPFP) for over three years; special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above criteria, married unemployed people can swap their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.  In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer entitlement to his or her spouse, who is unemployed but not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation on community employment.</P>
    <P>Also, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension or deserted wife's benefit can apply to transfer to one parent family payment to become eligible to participate in community employment.</P>
    <P>Participants are recruited by sponsors who are free to take on any person who fulfills any of the criteria outlined above and no recruitment quotas are imposed on sponsors in respect of National Rehabilitation Board referrals, lone parents or those coming from the live register.</P>

      <P>The land parcel identification system was developed in 1995 to fulfil an obligation under the EU regulations, governing the payment of grants from the EAGGF.  The land parcel identification system has at present a graphical representation of over 132,000 farms and the 800,000 or so parcels of land that make up those farms. All of this information has been captured from the information supplied by herdowners who submit area aid application forms.</P>
      <P>The digitising process is only one aspect of the overall operation which is implemented each year in the area aid unit in order to process the 132,000 applications which are received.  The registration of all applications is first completed in order to issue receipts.  This involves a bar-coding system with each individual application being bar-coded by the unit's staff.  Applications are then scanned to provide a register of digital images for on-screen retrieval.  As well as capturing and interpreting the specific handwritten and printed data, this process is necessary to facilitate easy access to the application and immediate copying as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The digitising aspect of the operation is undertaken on foot of maps received from farmers who indicate a change to their holding.  In 1998 Mallon Technology was contracted to carry out the required digitising.  Over 35,000 farmers submitted <Col N="144" /> maps with their applications in 1998.  On processing the applications, however, it transpired that this did not reflect the full extent of 1998 applications that required digitising.  A further 2,300 applicants who indicated a change in their holding over the previous year failed to enclose a map or maps identifying the additional land. These applicants have since been requested to submit the outstanding maps.  In addition, some 10,000 applicants were involved in instances of overlaps and dual claims on land parcels, two or more farmers claiming entitlement to the same land.  Again these applicants had to be contacted and appropriate arrangements made to establish the correct position.  These difficulties have also arisen in previous years and in entering the 1998 scheme, a backlog was carried forward from 1997. It is my intention that the 1998 scheme will be finalised well before the 1999 scheme begins.</P>
    <P>The level of digitising error is low and of itself would not be a significant factor in the clearance of applications.  All of the situations outlined above have, however, implications for the digitising process.  The identification and resolution of such problems is one of the reasons the EU provided for the introduction of such a system.  It is clear, therefore, that the digitising process could not be completed within a short period of receipt of the area aid applications.</P>
    <P>There are currently 44 people engaged by Mallon Technology in the 1998 digitising process.  It is not possible to give an accurate value of the contract at this point as the work in general is paid for on a per unit basis and much of it will extend into the preparatory phase for next years scheme.  To date, £400,000, including VAT, has been paid.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, as I announced last week, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  This means that the farmers concerned who are already in REPS or who join, on the basis of the national framework plan, can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for milk producers with special difficulties under the super levy system were set out in a notice published in the national newspapers on 17 November 1984.  One of the categories eligible to apply for additional quota under this scheme was that of producers whose deliveries in 1983 were seriously affected by animal disease.  Eligible producers in this disease category were confined to those who had at least 10 per cent of their cows affected by brucellosis, tuberculosis or leukosis and whose deliveries of milk to a purchaser in 1983 were less than deliveries in either 1981 or 1982.  The closing date for receipt of applications from these special category producers was 14 January 1985.  No application was received from the persons concerned at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> An application was made to the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal on 26 June 1990 and a small quota allocation was made.  A subsequent application was made to the tribunal on 27 June 1992 but was unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>It will be open to the persons in question to apply to the tribunal for an allocation of quota on hardship grounds when application forms for the 1999-2000 milk quota year become available.</P>

      <P>In relation to the application of the levies to pensions, it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  Treating old age pension payments as income for tax purposes, including levies, is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>However, the current arrangements in respect of the health levy and the employment and training levy are more favourable to many pensioners than most taxpayers because the levy is not applicable to their social welfare pension.  The total income of medical card holders and recipients of social welfare survivors and widows pensions, lone parents allowance and deserted wives benefit-allowance are exempt from the levies. Furthermore, the low income exemption threshold for the levies now stands at £207 per week, £10,750 per annum, following the last budget. Therefore the levies will apply only where income from other sources is in excess of £10,750 per annum.  The existing arrangement ensures that most pensioners on low incomes are exempt from the levies.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the campaign for a reduced rate of betting tax and of the practice of tax free offshore betting, which has already been raised in the House and is the subject of very active lobbying by bookmakers.  My officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners are monitoring this closely.  However, I am glad to point out that there has been no falling off this year in Exchequer receipts from betting.  The receipts to end of September are £40.1 million, which is an increase of 16.7 per cent over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>A report commissioned by the Allied Betting Shops' Association, which was presented to me recently, indicates that telephone betting currently constitutes a little over 7 per cent of total turnover.  The implications for the Exchequer of a growth in such betting is a matter which I will keep under scrutiny.  As any examination of the tax rates applicable to betting is a matter for consideration in the context of the preparations for the budget, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any campaign for a review of this tax.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination <Col N="151" /> of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review the medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department is continuing to have discussions with the health board chief executive officers regarding their views on these issues.  I expect to make a decision about these matters shortly.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for those who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are presently 61 consultant orthopaedic surgeon posts in the public hospital system, which <Col N="152" /> is a ratio of 1 per 59,000 population.  The number of posts has more than doubled over the last 20 years.  I understand that in 1989 the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommended a short-term ratio of one consultant orthopaedic surgeon per 65,000 population to improve gradually to a ratio of one per 50,000, namely, about 70 consultant posts.  The institute is now recommending a ratio of one per 42,000 population.</P>
    <P>Orthopaedic surgery services have been developed on an ongoing basis over the years as the increase in the number of consultant posts illustrates.  A regional service exists in each health board area.  In the context of competing priorities at health board level and as resources allow this process of ongoing development will continue in future years.  The Government's strategy for the provision of acute hospital services generally is based on the principles of regional self-sufficiency; equity of access; and the redressing of regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>Towards implementing this strategy, a network of general and local hospitals is being developed throughout the country, which will enable the continuation of the provision of high quality hospital services for general medical and surgical facilities.  Part of this development is the establishment of improved, co-ordinated working arrangements between hospitals in individual health board areas, primarily through the establishment of joint departments and joint appointments, designed to respond to the acute hospital needs of local populations and to optimise the effectiveness of the resources allocated.  The network of general and local hospitals is supplemented by larger regional hospitals and by a small number of highly specialised tertiary or supra-regional units, serving much wider catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made in recent years in the development of the acute hospital infrastructure and the provision of specialities to meet local needs and I intend to continue with this, with particular reference to regional self-sufficiency and equity of access.  Toward this end, I am investing an increased level of funding in capital developments in the health services in the current capital programme, a large proportion of which is going towards the development of acute hospitals.  The capital programme for the next two years will amount to £155 million in 1999 and £165 million in 2000.  Continued implementation of the cancer strategy and the cardio-vascular strategy will also result in the provision of critical services at local level, thus obviating the need for persons to travel long distances to receive treatment outside their regions.</P>

It should also be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major development project for the Mater Hospital has been under discussion for some time.  Consequently, I was pleased to be in a position to approve the development of phase I of the project in November 1997, at a cost limit of £25 million.  In May 1998, I approved the appointment of the design team for the development.  Its initial task will be the preparation of a development control plan &mdash; DCP &mdash; for the entire Mater site, including the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, followed by phase I of the development. Phase I will include the following: accident and emergency department; out patient department; hospital sterile services department; and operating theatres.</P>
      <P>Surveys of the site and of existing buildings are currently being carried out.  Completion of the DCP is scheduled for the end of this year.  I would hope that the detailed planning of phase I will be completed by autumn 1999 and that construction work would proceed without delay.</P>

      <P>I have approved a multi-million pound investment programme to support the re-organisation and re-development of the BTSB nationally.  The primary objective is to ensure that the BTSB is resourced to provide a transfusion service in line with best international standards.  I am making significant additional resources available to the BTSB to support the following programmes: a new national headquarters at a cost of approximately £25 million; the introduction of new technologies to improve the safety of the blood supply, at a total annual cost of £4.7 million; additional staff appointments.</P>
      <P>Additional medical consultants will be recruited including consultant support to be located at the Cork centre.  My Department has also approved the recruitment of four additional quality assurance staff, two of whom will be at the Cork centre.</P>
      <P>The total additional costs of the development programme, excluding the capital funding, will be approximately £6.5 million 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> I am also providing a total of approximately £4 million to replace the existing IT system to ensure Year 2000 compliance.  These resources will ensure the accelerated implementation of the new IT system which involves the Cork centre in particular. Five technical staff at the centre have been released on a full time basis on this project. Resources have been made available to backfill these five posts, one person has been released full time on the IT project at the Dublin centre and that position has also been backfilled.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is licensed by the Irish Medicines Board to collect and process whole blood and human plasma for the use in the manufacture of medicinal products. The BTSB is not a manufacturer of blood products. It collects plasma for fractionation abroad, which is used for the production of blood products such as albumin and plasma-derived factor IX which are used in Irish hospitals.  The Irish Medicines board is a statutory independent body and is the regulatory authority for the BTSB. Accordingly, the regulatory requirements specified by the IMB must be met by the BTSB in order to retain their licence.  The manner in which these requirements are met is a matter for the BTSB, provided it meets with the approval of the IMB.  For my part, I will ensure that the BTSB is sufficiently resourced to ensure regulatory compliance.</P>
    <P>The BTSB's current manufacturing licence covers the period 1 August 1998 to 31 October 1999.  There are four conditions attached to the licence as follows: validation of the existing computer system for control of donations and components at the Dublin and Cork centres; the new computer system to be installed in both centres is to be fully validated; a construction and validation timetable is to be provided in relation to the new national headquarters; replacement of the area for the processing of donations at the Cork centre.</P>
    <P>Considerable work has been completed to date on the validation of the existing system, and additional work is on-going.  The IMB's validation requirements for the new system (which is currently being installed and will be operational before the end of next year) will also be met.  The new system is one which is in use in a number of European and American blood centres.</P>
    <P>As regards the requirement for capital investment in the Cork centre to meet regulatory requirements, a number of options have been considered by the BTSB.  The options include the upgrade of existing buildings and/or replacement of existing buildings on site, or a move to a new site and the construction of a new centre.  In November 1997, the BTSB commenced evaluation of these options, including evaluation work on a new centre.  The BTSB also undertook a substantial capital investment programme at the Cork centre which involved the provision of: a new components processing laboratory; a new compatibility testing laboratory; a new product storage <Col N="156" /> area; an upgrade of the donor clinic; and new office accommodation.</P>
    <P>The resources to complete this programme were made available by my Department at a total cost of £464,000, with an additional £60,000 for equipment.  The BTSB has advised my Department that the new components processing laboratory which is referred to in its licence is now among the best of its kind in Europe, and that, at a recent inspection by the IMB, the level of compliance was considered acceptable and in accordance with the EC Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice.  My Department has been given to understand that at a meeting on 3 November 1998 between the BTSB and the IMB, it was agreed that a review of the proposals involving the Cork facility would take place after the current inspections have been completed on 27 November. The BTSB has also advised my Department that it has identified a number of areas at the centre which require improvement or replacement, including storage and accommodation for equipment validation.  The BTSB will discuss these matters and the implementation of any recommendations of the IMB arising from its inspections at both centres.</P>
    <P>The BTSB is fully committed to ensuring that the Cork centre continues to meet the requirements of the IMB.  For my part, further capital investment in the centre will be dictated by the requirements of the IMB and any additional resources necessary for this purpose will be made available.  Furthermore, proposals submitted by the board of the BTSB for capital investment which are over and above those necessary to ensure regulatory compliance will also be considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1994, it is a function of local authorities to make proper arrangements for the management, custody, care and conservation of their records and archives, and to provide public access to their archives.  In order to support and encourage local authorities my Department, with the assistance of the National Archives, put in place a strategy for the development of archives services.  The measures introduced on foot of this strategy include the following: (a) a survey of the records and archives held by local authorities was conducted in 1995 by the National Archives on behalf of my Department; (b) a detailed survey result together with guidelines on the development of the local authority archives service was published on foot of the survey; (c) a subsidy scheme was established whereby local authorities may recoup 50 per cent of the salary of an archivist employed by them provided the archivist is employed on a regional basis; (d) local authorities may also qualify for up to 50 per cent subsidy in respect of leasing accommodation for the purposes of processing archives; and (e) archives storage facilities have been funded as part of some library projects.</P>
      <P>Prior to these measures, local authorities had employed only four archivists.  However, there are now nine archivists covering 15 local authorities throughout the country, and it is proposed to appoint two further archivists covering four or more local authorities in due course.  In addition, my Department has provided funding for archive accommodation to two local authorities, and has proposals on hands from four others.  I will continue to promote these measures, and to keep the terms of the scheme under review, where appropriate.</P>

      <P>The current draft of the EU Water Framework Directive, on which common understanding was reached at the Environment Council in June, proposes that member states shall take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services in accordance with the polluter pays principle.

The current draft of Article 12 of the directive takes account of the view that it should be a matter for member states to determine charging policy in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.  I stated my intention at the June Council to continue to exempt domestic water services from water charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources specifies a limit of 50 mg/l, milligrams per litre in respect of surface freshwaters and groundwaters.  This limit represents a threshold for the designation of vulnerable zones and the establishment of action programmes in respect of such zones.  The measures required under such action programmes are designed to reduce pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources in designated vulnerable zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> Under the terms of the directive, an extensive programme of monitoring was carried out by local authorities in 1992 and 1993 to establish a baseline for assessing and combating nitrate pollution problems.  The results of this monitoring showed that, in general, nitrate levels were well below the standard of 50 mg/l identified in the directive.  As a consequence, there was no basis for designating vulnerable zones under the directive in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In January 1997 local authorities were requested to carry out a one-year repeat programme of monitoring of nitrate levels in surface waters and groundwaters, as required under the directive.  Reports on this monitoring programme have been received by my Department from nearly all relevant local authorities and are being assessed.  These assessments will include a review of the need for designation of vulnerable zones.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the requirements of Directive 80/778/EEC relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption, the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, specify a maximum admissible concentration of 50 mg/l in respect of nitrates in drinking water.  The Environmental Protection Agency publishes annual reports on the monitoring of drinking water supplies, including details in relation to nitrate levels in public, group and small-private supplies throughout the country.  Copies of these reports are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to Question No. 25 of 11 June 1998, I outlined the results of a survey carried out by my Department in 1997 in relation to the amount of zoned-serviced land in local authority ownership available for residential purposes.  My Department is carrying out a more comprehensive survey, in conjunction with the local authorities involved, in relation to the availability of zoned and serviced building land, in local authority and private ownership, in the Dublin and <Col N="164" /> mid-east regions and also in relation to the Cork and Galway areas.  I expect the results of this survey to be available shortly.  The compilation of similar information for all local authority areas in respect of 1998 and subsequent years will be undertaken in the context of my Department's annual planning statistics publication.</P>
    <P>The provision by local authorities of low cost sites, either serviced or unserviced, to people in need of housing is a long standing social housing option.  I and my Department regularly encourage local authorities to be creative in their response to the social housing needs of their areas and, in particular, to avail of the full range of options available to them, including the provision of sites. I regard the provision of low cost sites by local authorities as an important element in their response to the housing needs of their areas, including the needs of first time home seekers.</P>

      <P>A range of options are available from local authorities to assist potential house purchasers on lower incomes, including: the shared ownership scheme which is available irrespective of income to certain households such as approved applicants for local authority housing, and to other households in need of housing, subject to an income test which equates to £20,000 in the case of a single income household; house purchase loans to a maximum of £50,000 generally and which are available on the same basis as the shared ownership scheme; the mortgage allowance scheme which is available to local authority tenants and tenant purchasers and rental subsidy tenants who return their house to the authority or voluntary body which provided it and who purchase a house for their own occupation, and the low cost sites scheme under which serviced or unserviced sites can be made available by local authorities for as little as £100 to people in need of housing.</P>
      <P>I have secured increased funding for these housing options in 1999 and I do not, therefore, expect funding issues to inhibit local authorities in their operation.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements were introduced to the terms of the shared ownership and local authority housing loan schemes last April under the Government's Action on House Prices package.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the significantly increased commitment of State expenditure in recent years aimed at systematically improving our non-national roads. Total State allocations of non-national roads has increased by 18 per cent in 1998 over 1997, in relation to initial year allocations.  For 1999, a total of more than £242 million in non-national road grants will be provided, mainly through the new local government fund which I have established; this will represent a further annual increase of 18 per cent.</P>

    <P>The Government is committed to providing sufficient moneys to enable the restoration programme to be completed over the ten years originally envisaged.  As firm evidence of this commitment, I provided more than £118 million in restoration grants in 1998 as compared with £93.3 million in 1997.  This has accelerated the programme and has allowed county councils to undertake almost 90 per cent of their 1999 restoration improvement schemes in 1998; by the end of the year a total of more than 5,200 road <Col N="168" /> schemes will have been financed across the country, with some 8,400 kilometres of road benefiting from the expenditure involved.  Since mid 1995, when the restoration programme was launched, to the end of 1998 more than 14,800 schemes will have been completed with over 24,000 kilometres or 27 per cent of the network benefiting.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State who are aged 66 years or over.  It is also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in the main in receipt of social welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are also available to low-income pensioners, including public and semi-State pensioners, who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means-test.  The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is currently £83 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £88 for a recipient aged 80 years or over; plus £30; plus any increases for dependants or for living alone.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the free schemes, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted people who satisfy this condition.  This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal, which would have cost implications, will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>Globally, alien species have been identified as the second largest threat to biodiversity after habitat degradation.  They may also cause environmental and economic loss.  Conversely, alien species may also bring economic benefits.  It is also the case that many species now established in Ireland, and regarded by many to be native, are in fact introduced species.  It must also be borne in mind that once alien species have been introduced and become established, it is generally very difficult to eradicate them.  Neither is it always possible to prevent the introduction of non-native species, particularly where such species are accidentally introduced.  However, preventing the introduction in the first instance of potentially damaging non-native species is amongst the most effective means of countering the threat such alien species pose to native species and habitats.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that existing wildlife legislation, including the Wildlife Act, 1976, provides me with powers to take certain measures to counter problems in respect of alien species.  In particular, under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, I may, in consultation with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, where appropriate, by direction prohibit the introduction into the wild of any non-native species which pose a threat to natural habitats or to wild native fauna or flora.  I have, however, been reviewing this issue and will be bringing forward enhanced legislative proposals in the context of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill to help deal with the potential threats that alien species may pose to native wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that a number of international conventions and agreements include provisions for dealing with the problems posed by alien species.  For example, under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which <Col N="173" /> has been ratified by Ireland, the issue of alien species is being actively addressed with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, developing guiding principles for the prevention, introduction and mitigation of impacts of such species.  Furthermore, I propose to introduce in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill the necessary amendments to allow Ireland to ratify the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA), another international agreement which includes provisions concerned with alien species.  It would be my intention to arrange for ratification of AEWA as soon as possible after the enactment of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of children with hearing impairment enrolled in mainstream primary schools in County Mayo is not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>Children with hearing impairment have access to a range of special education services.  In some cases, the severity of the impairment may be such that placement in a special dedicated school or a special class is the most appropriate response.  In other cases, the child may be capable of functioning successfully in an integrated setting with an element of special support.  Such support may take the form of the resource teacher service or the visiting teacher service.  My Department also provides radio aid equipment for children with hearing impairment in first and second-level schools.</P>

The nearest such facility would be three special classes based in Galway which currently cater for 21 hearing impaired children.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in the provision of special education services. A key element of this initiative is the introduction of a formalised system of special support for children attending school on an integrated basis who have been assessed as having a special need.

      <P>Arising from the PCW agreement on teachers' pay and conditions, approximately 500 new assistant principal posts were created in vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  The PCW agreement did not provide for a specific additional teaching allocation to be made to school authorities arising from the creation of assistant principal posts.  However, while these posts could result in a notional loss of four hours class contact per post, I have met with representatives of management, teacher unions and parents to discuss this matter.

      <P>The position is that arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement.  The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of the work of payment has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits <Col N="177" /> of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering phone queries between 10 and 12 in the morning in the case of secondary teachers and between 2.30 and 4.30 in the afternoon in the case of primary teachers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before the end of the year.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due by the end of the year, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>

      <Quest>the reason undergraduates receive support grants for third level courses held abroad which are available here while postgraduates receive no assistance towards courses held abroad which are not available here; his views on the matter; and the measures, if any, he will take to remove the injustice and anomaly and allow fees and other expenses incurred abroad on educational courses to be offset against income tax paid here by students or their parents.</Quest>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants for students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration, in a university of third-level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds, in another EU member state. Students studying abroad do not receive any assistance towards their tuition fees under the schemes.  Postgraduate studies abroad were not covered in this extension.  I should point out to the Deputy that any extension of the student support schemes in relation to grants can only be considered in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996 (as <Col N="178" /> amended by the Finance Act, 1997) provides for tax relief at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years.  The tax relief provisions do not extend to postgraduate courses.  Nor is tax relief available on fees paid for courses abroad.</P>
    <P>The question of extending tax reliefs is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that assessment services, remedial provision and guidance on educational choices are available to children with dyslexia and their parents, as in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5; and the plans, if any, he has to improve these services.</Quest>

      <P>A wide range of special support is available to children with special educational needs, including those with specific learning disability (dyslexia).  In addition to the range of special schools and special classes dedicated to children with more serious conditions, children participating in the education system on an integrated basis are supported by the remedial and resource teacher services.</P>
      <P>The precise nature of the required response in any individual case will depend on the needs of the individual child.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.  A total of 1,302 remedial teachers are currently in place in the primary system. The advice of my Department's inspectorate is also available to schools catering for children with specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>In certain cases, teachers may require further advice from a psychologist.  My Department provides an educational psychological service at present to more than 700 primary schools.  The psychologists service advises teachers and parents and, if necessary, carries out assessments of individual students, as the resources of time and personnel allow.  I understand that the school attended by the child in question is among those served by my Department's psychological service. I will arrange, therefore, for the relevant psychologist to investigate the child's needs.</P>
