      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach let us know if legislation will be introduced soon to deal with the taxi problem?  The forum he set up &mdash; to delay making a decision &mdash; has only had two meetings and the problem of getting a taxi in Dublin is increasingly difficult.  I hope the Taoiseach will not continue to put this matter on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it will require legislation but I share Deputy Bruton's concern that this issue needs to be resolved.  The problem is not so much getting a taxi as the difficulties of the regulations between cosies, hackneys and taxies.  A large number of vehicles are in operation but they are governed by different regulations.  The question of the provision of taxies for the handicapped is creating difficulties also.  I hope the forum will deal with these matters and that whatever conclusions its reaches will be speedily implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that this forum is operating under the Taoiseach's own aegis and that it has only met twice?  Given the urgency of the issue, this is a degree of latitude on the part of the forum that is not acceptable, given that the Taoiseach and his Department are leading on this issue.  Can the Taoiseach not insist that the forum increase the pace of its work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's recent association with the drugs awareness programme following the press conference in Ballyfermot, does the Government plan to bring forward new <Col N="1278" /> legislation to strengthen the fight against drug addiction and criminal trafficking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the objective of a number of Bills brought in recently by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other legislation introduced in recent years.  The recent Criminal Justice Bill has wide powers.  We must ensure now that all of the legislation passed by this House is fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is fairly well addressed in legislative terms because of the combined action of this and the previous Government.  The real problem arises for those addicts who come off drugs.  They need specific help to get decent employment.  Are there any legislative proposals to ensure they get the kind of employment that will stop them going back to their habit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the health boards received additional resources to assist in the rehabilitation programme.  The Minister for Health and Children recently announced regulations governing the dispensation of methadone, and I hope these measures will help to deal with the problem.  A major problem still exists, however, and a recent survey indicated that the number of addicts is approximately 10,000; the figure was 6,000 only 18 months ago.  In the light of that we must continue our efforts at every level to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the International War Crimes Tribunals Bill, 1997, will be brought before and approved by the House?  Has the Taoiseach noted the dire warning from the President of Russia that an attack by the United States on Iraq would result in a world war?  What steps is the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs taking, through the European Union, to persuade the United States to continue to seek every possible diplomatic solution to the problems with Iraq?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the remarks made by President Yeltsin yesterday.  I would not ignore comments by a world leader.  The Deputy can take it the Department of Foreign Affairs, given its involvement in European matters, is closely following all that is being said on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question regarding legislation on the Order of Business yesterday and I understand from the Taoiseach's Department that it will communicate with me during the day.  I am grateful for that information.  I wish to raise the urgent matter of an extradition case being taken today involving a women who could face the death penalty in Connecticut.  I understand an undertaking has been given to the State that she will not face the death penalty if we allow her extradition.  Will the Taoiseach during the course of the morning arrange for the relevant Department to communicate with me about the nature of that undertaking?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If legislation on this matter was before the House I would have an opportunity to raise this matter.  As the woman concerned will be brought before the courts today, I ask the Taoiseach to communicate with me about the nature of the undertaking given so that we can be sure she will not face the death penalty if she is extradited to Connecticut.  I raised this matter yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm media reports that it is the Government's intention to amend the Electoral Act by deleting the more unpalatable aspects of it?  Will he agree that we need to be careful before we tamper with legislation that has enhanced the democratic process, levelled the playing field and increased transparency and openness?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of removing unpalatable parts from any legislation related to the Electoral Act.  The Whips are trying to make sure that the legislation enacted is workable, in conjunction with the commission, to make sure that we comply with the core principles of that legislation.  That is all that has been suggested.  I am sure the Deputy would be one of the first to subscribe to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if it would be possible to produce a separate sheet on promised legislation which would indicate the Bills that would be referred to various committees at heads stage for debate prior to publication?  It would be useful if he could indicate what Bills would be referred to committees for discussion before publication.  The committees have power to discuss the heads of a Bill before the Government produces a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, I must express some concern about the dearth of legislation in the health area, given that no new Bills were introduced in the last session and only one new Bill is promised for this session.  I am concerned about two particular Bills that are urgently needed and long overdue.  They include the Bill to reorganise the Eastern Health Board and the mental health Bill.  Will the Taoiseach explain why there has been such a delay in introducing those two Bills?  Will he guarantee they will be introduced before the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some ten or 11 Bills at various stages of preparation by the Department of Health and Children.  The mental health Bill has more than 100 heads and I understand it will be ready by the middle of the year.  The draft heads were approved by Government during the summer and sent to the parliamentary draftsman for drafting.  That process of drafting has been ongoing involving the usual discussion between the Department and the parliamentary draftsman.  It is expected the Bill will be ready mid year.  The legislation on the reform of the Eastern Health Board will be ready later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he told the House on 19 November that the mental health Bill would be ready in the spring of this year?  Now he says it will not be ready until the middle of the year.  Will the Taoiseach give us an explanation for the slippage from what he told the House on 19 November?  Will he let us know the position on the private third level bonding Bill?  The Minister, Deputy Martin, when in Opposition raised that matter several times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be some time before the bonding Bill will be ready.  As Deputy Bruton will recall, that was the first Bill he promised to deal with in 1995, but it had still not been dealt with&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to table a question to the Minister for Education and Science, he can outline the position for the Deputy.

On 29 January the Minister said in reply to a question I asked him that he had no details of how that group was transacting its affairs and refused to give any information on that group.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have a unique education system of which we can be very proud.  Historically, it has been through education that people have sought to progress and there is no doubt that the quality of the education provided throughout our schools has given us not only our literary and academic reputation, but also our considerable economic success.  What is particularly noteworthy about our system is how it has developed organically, without the overwhelming central control exercised in so many countries.  This is not to say there has been no central control in important areas, but there has been a freedom of choice and diversity absent in many countries.</P>
      <P>We should recognise that the role of legislation in providing for education is a complex question; it is not possible to simply pass a law and expect every problem in the education world to disappear.  Resources will always be an issue, and we will have an extensive opportunity to discuss the funding of education when we consider the Estimates over the coming months.  I believe that the basic role for overall legislation like this is to provide an enabling framework; one which protects valuable traditions and allows for the further development of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little need for me to speak at length of the great achievements of the Irish education system.  They are visible all around us in the prosperous, sophisticated and confident society we have created.  The statistics are also impressive. The most recent statistical report of my Department records that in that school year there were over 478,000 first level students in 3,317 publicly funded schools which had 21,052 teaching posts. At second level over 370,000 second level students in 768 publicly funded schools were taught by almost 21,000 full-time teachers, with <Col N="1286" /> additional part-time teaching.  Almost one third of our population, therefore, are at present engaged in education at first and second levels alone.  While these are statistics to be proud of they also pose challenges and they certainly should not induce complacency &mdash; there is still much to be done.</P>
    <P>Against the background of an education system which has operated without any statutory basis and which is by any measure a success, the most obvious question is why the Oireachtas should now seek to legislate for it.  There are many reasons for this, including developments in society, legal and constitutional imperatives and the requirements of accountability and transparency in modern administration.</P>
    <P>The structure and administration of the present education system at first level derives from a letter written in 1831 by the then Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Stanley, to the Duke of Leinster who was to become the chairman of a new Board of Commissioners for National Education.  The second level system, outside the vocational education sector, has its origins in legislation enacted in the latter part of the last century.  The absence of comprehensive legislation enacted by the Oireachtas relating to first and second level education has long been the subject of critical comment by commentators, the courts and most recently the Constitution Review Group.  There has long been unease that the administration and regulation of a complex system are conducted through a process of administrative circular.  This Bill will fill the legislative vacuum and complement the constitutional provisions relating to education.</P>
    <P>On a social level, the consensus which previously operated and which facilitated the operation of the education system in our schools through an alliance of Government and school owners needs formal articulation in a legislative context. The other partners in education, notably parents and teachers, wish to see their role given formal recognition.  Parents in particular increasingly want to exercise in a meaningful, practical way their constitutional rights and duties as the primary educators of their children.  Furthermore, the interest which the wider community has in the quality of its schools and the scope for the community to contribute to the mission of the schools is recognised by most objective observers.  A key objective of this Bill is to provide, on a legislative basis, for the respective roles and functions of all the partners in the education system.  Anyone who has observed the process leading to this Bill will be aware that it has grown not out of the view of any individual or small group, but from a consideration and distillation of the views of many.  There has been a very lengthy process, stretching back to my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, leading to the publication of this Bill. The publication of the Green Paper on Education in 1992 marked the beginning of a process of widespread consultation and discussion on how the education system should be reformed to meet <Col N="1287" /> modern challenges and the demands placed upon it.  The Green Paper noted the unsatisfactory position that:</P>
    <P>Ireland is probably unique among European countries in the degree to which it administers an education system without a comprehensive and up-to-date legislative structure.</P>
    <P>It also noted a continuing concern about the lack of openness and the relatively minor role played by parents in the system.  There has been widespread debate on these and other matters since 1992 and on my immediate predecessor's proposals.</P>
    <P>I have sought to address the many issues raised over the past five years in a spirit of inclusive dialogue informed by a simple, overriding premise; we need legislation that ensures that the education system is as responsive, effective, efficient and accountable as possible in meeting and responding to the rapidly changing demands for high quality education into the next millennium. Since I came into office I have undertaken an extensive process of consultation with the partners in education on a range of matters, but most particularly on the contents of an Education Bill. I have taken into account the concerns of the education partners in drafting the Bill now before this House.  In all, this has amounted to the largest ever consultation process carried out in my Department in advance of the publication of a Bill.</P>
    <P>Rather than going through the Bill section by section, I propose to outline some of its principal features and explain the rationale behind them. Because of the level of debate in recent years on the establishment of regional education boards, I will at this stage briefly refer to them.  The Bill does not involve the establishment of these boards, a move which has been welcomed by most groups.  Many inflated claims were made for the boards about how they would solve problems in a range of areas and would, somehow, bring education closer to communities.  The concept of these boards was fundamentally flawed on a number of levels, but most importantly educationally and financially.</P>
    <P>We should be clear on what these boards would actually have done.  At base, they would have been a vehicle for the massive extension of State control of schools and would have increased greatly the levels of bureaucracy.  Rather than devolving power from the Minister, they represented a vehicle for making it more comprehensive.  In nearly every area the proposal made clear that decisions would be made centrally by the Minister, with the boards acting merely as clearing houses.  In this, they represented a damaging departure from the very characteristic of our system which has been so successful &mdash; local autonomy.  This &ldquo;Statist&rdquo; model has been discredited in many countries and it would be extraordinary if we were to move towards it at the very time others are trying to discard it.</P>

      <P>Some of the great stereotypes of departmental control are well out of date.  An important example of this can be seen in the primary capital area where I will this year, for example, allocate more than £10 million to schools for them to spend on minor capital projects at their own discretion, subject to proper accounting.  I accept the need for reforms and am committed to further practical action, but this must build on, and not undermine, the strengths of our system.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in extending my control of the system.  I am interested in working in partnership with all those involved in education.  As a result, I have not included in the Bill a range of new powers which it was previously proposed should be given to the Minister.  Leaving aside that the proposed boards would have extended bureaucracy and would have made little or no educational contribution, their cost would have been unjustifiable.  I spent many months in Opposition attempting to get the previous Government to tell the House what the boards would cost, but to no avail.  I have since discovered that a 1995 estimate stated that they could cost up to £40 million a year to run and that no credible plan was drawn up for their establishment.</P>
      <P>I can think of no circumstance where the expenditure of £40 million on creating a new layer of bureaucracy should take precedence over using scarce resources where they are needed most &mdash; in the classroom.  The approach outlined in the Bill directly fulfils promises contained both in our election manifesto and in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>One of the central objectives of the Bill is to promote and give statutory recognition to partnership as a principle which underpins the operation of the education system.  That system cannot be managed and administered by a small elite.  It must be one the management of which is open to all the stakeholders and which is operated for the benefit of students.</P>
      <P>The principle of partnership is underlined early in the Bill in the Long Title.  It is reinforced in section 6(e) which sets out the objects of the Bill. It is to be found time and time again in the many provisions which require the consent of or consultation with the education partners and is emphasised in section 14, which places the establishment of a board of management in schools firmly within the context of the requirements of partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership implies that the partners act together through seeking common ground and consensus, rather than any one of them seeking to impose a particular view.  It implies a process of discussion and negotiation, rather than coercion, and it implies a tolerance, perhaps even encouragement, of diversity rather than uniformity.  The letter and spirit of this Bill is consistent with the principle of a partnership among equals <Col N="1289" /> in matters central to the governance and management of our schools.</P>
    <P>The success of our education system fundamentally rests on the skills and dedication of the more than 40,000 teachers who work in our schools.  We should not only recognise but celebrate their role.  I have included a specific section concerning teachers.  Section 22 recognises that, in general, teachers are responsible for the instruction provided to students and contribute to their education and personal development. It further recognises the differing roles they may play within the school.  Their vital role also permeates the remainder of the Bill.  An example of this is the right of teachers to be consulted on a range of issues at both school and national level, including appointment and appeal procedures and school planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill also recognises the pivotal role of principals, particularly as the instructional leaders of the school community and it outlines their various areas of responsibility.  The principal of a school is the leader of a unique community, not readily comparable to other spheres of activity, such as business or commercial life generally.  I have already established a specific review group to examine the role of principals.  The Bill provides a solid framework within which they will complete their work.</P>
    <P>One of the features of our education system at first and second level is the degree of autonomy enjoyed by our schools.  There was always a danger that in seeking to legislate for schools some of that autonomy would be sacrificed in the interests of legal certainty and uniformity.  I am happy to inform the House that the autonomy of schools is enhanced by this Bill.  The Bill gives specific statutory recognition to the patrons of schools.  This person or, in some cases, a body of people, normally establishes the school out of a desire to educate students in a particular environment.  This environment, which the Bill refers to as the &ldquo;characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo; may relate to language, religion or religions, a particular teaching method, an emphasis on a particular skill, be it musical or sporting or a combination of any or all of these.  Whatever it is, the Bill gives statutory support to the right of anyone to establish a school according to a particular characteristic spirit and to receive public funds, subject only to meeting certain requirements relating primarily to viability and educational criteria.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically provides in section 7 that the Minister for Education and Science must at all times have regard to the right of a school to manage its own affairs in accordance with its charters or other such instruments.  The importance of these instruments, through which schools were established or which are agreements entered into with parents and teachers, is also underscored in section 15 which requires boards of management to act in accordance with the terms of such documents.  As a further recognition of the traditional autonomy of schools, the Bill also requires the Minister to have regard to <Col N="1290" /> the practices and traditions relating to the organisation of schools or groups of schools which exist at present.  These provisions are aimed at preserving the autonomy of and diversity among schools, qualities which have served the education system well.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of schools is further supported by other measures.  The recognition of schools will be conducted in a transparent way in accordance with statutory requirements.  Schools will be funded in accordance with statutory criteria and schools and their boards of management will have specific statutory roles and duties.</P>
    <P>In section 14 the Bill supports the involvement of all the education partners in the management of schools and gives statutory support to the principle of partnership in school management.  In doing so, however, it is my objective to avoid prescriptive provisions which limit the autonomy of schools and which rely on coercion rather than consensus for enforcement.  For that reason the Bill emphasises the requirements of partnership in placing a duty on patrons, wherever practicable, to appoint a board of management.  The phrase, &ldquo;wherever practicable&rdquo;, is intended to address situations where there are objectively sound reasons for a board not being appointed.  I am confident, however, that such is the widespread recognition of the benefits of the involvement of all the stakeholders in the management of schools that within a short time of the enactment of this Bill the majority of our schools at all levels will voluntarily implement the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>Already at primary level there is clear evidence of the potential for such consensus.  Parents, patrons and teachers have already agreed a model for boards of management which will apply in such schools.  I was pleased to have been able to help the reaching of this consensus last year and elections to boards of management of primary schools have been taking place throughout the country since then.  The position at second level may be more complex because of the diversity of school types.  However, I know that the model of co-operation which worked so well at primary level will work again at second level, while retaining the diversity which is a hallmark of those schools.  I and my Department will do all we can to assist the partners reach appropriate agreements.</P>
    <P>Those who pay for public services and those who use them increasingly demand that the providers of those services are accountable for their actions and that their operations are transparent to ensure there is meaningful accountability.  This assertiveness by the public is a relatively recent development and is probably due in part to the success of the education system in producing more aware and proactive members of society. The Education Bill addresses issues of accountability on a number of levels.</P>
    <P>Schools are required to be accountable to parents.  They must keep proper audited accounts; they must establish procedures for informing parents <Col N="1291" /> of matters relating to the performance of the school; they must prepare and circulate the school's plan to parents; they must ensure that parents have access to records on their children; they must establish a grievance procedure for students or their parents and they must facilitate and give all reasonable assistance to parents' associations.  Many of these requirements also apply as regards the accountability of schools to their students, depending on their age and experience.</P>
    <P>Boards of management are required to be accountable to the patron on whose behalf it manages the school.  Schools, through their boards, are required to be accountable to the Minister in respect of financial matters and the conduct of the school in accordance with the Bill and regulations.  The Minister in turn is accountable to the schools in that requirements for funding and recognition must be transparent.  The Minister is accountable to the community through their elected representatives in this House.  The Bill, therefore, constructs a framework within which each of the stakeholders has both duties and rights in relation to accountability.</P>
    <P>Catering for children with special needs has rightly become a major focus of education policy since the establishment of the Special Education Review Committee by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, during her time as Minister for Education.  Most of the core principles are clear and I am conscious of the level of need and the fact that resources will continue to be the major issue.  It is not the case that simply establishing a series of committees will deal with this area, as suggested by some.</P>
    <P>In the Long Title to this Bill a specific reference is made to children with special needs and section 7 outlines that the Minister will have to ensure that an appropriate level and quality of education is made available to each person.  This is further added to in other parts of the Bill and establishes the key principles.  I have already held positive discussions with the Irish Council of People with Disabilities and have received a number of suggestions from it which I will consider on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier some statistics relating to the education system and I indicated that, while they were impressive, there was no room for complacency.  Notwithstanding the many achievements of our society and especially the economic achievements in recent years, there remain significant numbers of our citizens who, because of disadvantages, are at risk of being marginalised.  I am conscious of the important role which education has to play in overcoming disadvantage. Education is a crucial factor in breaking the cycle of inter-generational disadvantage and in reintegrating into society and the workforce those at risk of becoming marginalised.  My Department currently provides a wide range of programmes targeted across the continuum of educational provision <Col N="1292" /> to meet the needs of the educationally and socially disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The Government has identified social inclusion as the major challenge for the years ahead.  In areas such as early intervention, provision for the needs of early school leavers and providing a quality adult education service, further action will be needed and a commitment to action is contained in the programme for Government.  The achievement of these goals is a vital priority in ensuring that the continuing expansion of the economy will be balanced by growing social inclusion at all levels of society.  I am pleased to have already been able to implement initiatives in these areas in the months since my appointment and I will announce further initiatives in the near future.</P>
    <P>When enacted, this Bill will provide a statutory framework which will complement the many initiatives already operating.  It will do so through a combination of aspirational and practical provisions which have as their objective the elimination of educational disadvantage.  The opening words of the Long Title to the Bill convey directly what we are about.  It states: &ldquo;An Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the education of every child in the State.&rdquo;. This theme of education for all is carried through in the first stated object of the Bill in section 6 which is to provide, as far as practicable and having regard to resources, that each person in the State has available to him or her an appropriate level and quality of education to meet his or her needs and abilities.  That section goes on to state as an object of the Bill the promotion of equality of access to and participation in education and the promotion of adult education.</P>
    <P>In addition to these guiding principles for the implementation of the Bill when enacted, the Bill also provides two specific measures aimed at disadvantage.  In section 12 it is provided that the criteria for funding of schools may allow for the payment of additional moneys to schools having regard to the level of educational disadvantage. Section 32 provides for the establishment of a committee, the remit of which will be to advise on strategies to be adopted in tackling disadvantage.  The Bill makes clear that this committee will not be merely an intellectual talk shop; up to half its members must be drawn from bodies involved in relevant work.  In this way the marginalised and those who work closely with them can have a direct input to policy formation in this crucial area.</P>
    <P>The place of the Irish language in our schools curricula, its role in our education system and its place in the cultural and social life of our country have long been matters of debate.  There are those who would dismiss the language as a leftover of history, but they are a minority.  In general there is widespread affection for the language and a sense that its teaching should be encouraged.  In more recent times there has developed through the gaelscoileanna movement a more confident and proactive approach on the <Col N="1293" /> part of parents and teachers to the teaching of Irish and teaching through Irish.  This is arguably the most exciting and positive development in decades in the long struggle for revival of the Irish language.  The level of commitment shown by such parents and teachers is highly commendable and holds the key to the increasing use of the language and its revival as a language in common use.</P>
    <P>The Irish language is an essential part of Irish culture and tradition.  It is, therefore, an essential part of what we are as a people.  Education is primarily an exercise in helping people to develop and grow to the best of their abilities so that they can be fully part of society.  We are not concerned here with society in the abstract.  We are concerned with Irish society and the education of Irish people.  The Irish language is of great importance to the personal development of an Irish person.  Should our education system overlook that, we as a society would be the poorer.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt forálacha sa Bhille Oideachais a bhfuil sé mar aidhm leo cur le baint amach na spriocanna náisiúnta i leith na Gaeilge.  Beidh dualgas ar scoileanna i gcoitinne an Ghaeilge, agus traidisiúin, litríocht, ealaíona agus an cultúr Gaelach i gcoitinne a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé cheana féin gurb é mo thuairim go dtugann scoileanna ina múintear trí mheán na Gaeilge an-spreagadh do dhaoine maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is mian liom an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag na scoileanna sin a chaomhnú agus gach spreagadh is féidir a thabhairt don ghluaiseacht seo.  To that end, section 31 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a body which will have advisory, research and executive powers in relation to learning and teaching through Irish.  It is my objective that this dedicated, focused and committed body will give a further impetus to the long-standing national aim of a thriving Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have outlined how the autonomy of schools individually is supported by the Bill.  The education system generally is also given a new autonomy through the placing of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on a statutory footing as a statutory body corporate.  The NCCA has operated for many years on an ad hoc basis and has done much valuable work in the area of curriculum development.  Its <i>ad hoc</i> nature gave the wrong signal both to the council itself and to the education partners.  It has made a very considerable contribution to the fundamental area of what we are teaching in our schools.  The council is in no sense an optional extra to be retained or removed at the whim of a Minister.  It has a vital role to play in ensuring that appropriate expertise and objectivity is brought to bear in matters relating to the curriculum in schools.  In my view the council can best carry out that mission if placed on a proper statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Given the central importance of the State examinations, it is essential that they should be given protection through a sound statutory basis. The Bill will provide for this through a comprehensive range of provisions.  Innovations, such as <Col N="1294" /> my appointment of examination commissioners, are comprehended by the Bill.  The examinations involved include, in addition to the junior and leaving certificates, such examinations as the ceard teasteas and technical school examinations.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that serious interference with State examinations should be a statutory offence and the Bill provides for offences such as having improper possession of an examination paper before an examination.  I would emphasise that it is not intended that the serious penalties outlined in the Bill will relate to basic offences relating to candidates which can often be the result of the considerable pressure of the examination process. Existing procedures in these cases will continue, and sanctions will be proportionate and appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have outlined earlier in this speech my commitment to the principle of partnership in the development of our education system.  Partnership should not be confined solely to the immediate stakeholders in the system but should extend to co-operation at local level among all the bodies with an interest or an involvement in education. The Education Bill provides a broad statutory support for such partnership and co-operation.  Of particular relevance is section 6(e) of the Bill which states that one of the objectives on which the Bill is founded is the promotion of effective liaison and consultation between schools, centres for education, patrons, teachers, parents, the communities served by schools, local authorities, health boards and the Minister.  Schools are also obliged by section 9(i) to establish and maintain contacts with the community they serve.</P>
    <P>I repeat that it is not my intention to legislate in a prescriptive way for local partnerships and co-operation.  My aim is to encourage the growth of local partnerships and co-operation in education, which already exists, and enable it to develop in an organic way as the needs of communities require.  This does not need prescriptive statutory provisions which could in practice restrict development.  Neither does it need the expenditure of scarce resources on an expensive bureaucracy.  As Minister, I will facilitate and support local initiative, where appropriate and where needed.  County education fora could play a valuable role and I will be reviewing their establishment following the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The publication of this Bill is not an end in itself, but it is an important milestone on the path to a more open and responsive education system for all.  As I mentioned at the start of this speech, built on the idea of partnership and protecting the diversity which has been the strength of our system to date, it will provide an enabling framework to help our schools develop in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented round of consultations which preceded its publication has been one of the elements behind the positive response it has received from most parts of the education community.  As we undertake the parliamentary discussion of the Bill, I look forward to hearing the <Col N="1295" /> comments of all Deputies.  I hope this will be a constructive debate which focuses on how to provide for the future development of our education system for the good of its students and society.  I assure the House that I will constructively respond to the points raised.  This is an important Bill which deserves widespread support and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that apart from the Minister and myself most of the people in the Chamber are teachers.  Perhaps that says something about the approach of the Dáil to education.  As a community we have to wake up to the importance of education.  It is not the concern just of teachers and the education experts.  It is critical to our economic future.  It is the one area where we can create and maintain real competitive advantage as a nation.  Much of our recent achievement has undoubtedly been due to the success to date of our education system.</P>
      <P>However, the fact that our education system ranks first or second in the world gives a false and misleading impression.  The reality is substantially different and there is a danger in becoming too self-congratulatory about our system.  Let us take serious note of the recent OECD study which showed that 17 per cent of 16 to 25 year olds, those who have recently left our education system, are deemed to be at the lowest level of literacy and numeracy.  That is a shocking statistic.  It is commonly assessed by the experts that up to 21 per cent of our children leave our schools illequipped to cope with the pressures of obtaining and holding down a job in a modern economy. As far as children with a disability are concerned, 80 per cent remain unemployed during their posteducation lives.  In many areas of this city up to 25 per cent of children are persistent non-attenders in the school system.  We have to keep those issues in focus.  There is a temptation to think of education as delivering quality education to the high achievers in our society, but we have to look at the much wider remit of our education system. The Minister is right to review the points system. That is one of the most important areas of change if we are to dilute the excessive focus on the high achievers and make sure we deliver a system that caters for the needs of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much to be welcomed in the Bill which has had an extremely long gestation period under several Ministers, but the recooked version we have today is pretty thin gruel.  Much of what was challenging to the existing system has been taken out.  The biggest losers in that process have been parents and students with special needs.  Parents have seen their rights eroded through the watering down of the grievance and appeal procedures, the abandonment of the obligation to have an annual report on the performance of a school, the watering down of the obligation to establish a board representative of all partners, and the abandonment of local fora for debating education <Col N="1296" /> policy which went with the abandonment of regional boards.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Bill does not recognise as a clear legal obligation the rights of individual students with special needs to an appropriate education. The Minister was wrong to say that under section 7 he will have a duty to ensure there is made available to each person an appropriate level and quality of education.  This is not provided for and if the Minister reads section 7 he will see that this is the case.  The scribes who drafted the Minister's speech should rethink the points on this very important principle.</P>
    <P>The legal responsibility pinned on the education boards in the previous Bill has been diluted to a vague objective.  In so far as anything of substance remains, the buck has been passed on to individual schools.  It is wholly wrong that access for children with special needs should be dictated by the availability of resources in a particular school.  The management of these schools share that belief.  The Bill places an obligation on schools which they cannot hope to deliver.</P>
    <P>It is children with special needs who will lose out.  We should look to other countries which have put in place progressive legislative frame-works which demand that the potential of each child is developed to the maximum and that obstacles in their way are systematically overcome.  The Minister suggested in a recent interview that there were no such precedents. However, the American disabilities Act sets out obligations on schools and the education system in relation to access.  It not only sets these out in a legal way and recognises that they cannot be delivered overnight, but it also puts an obligation on the Minister or relevant agency to account for their stewardship each year and to show they acted reasonably to remove obstacles holding back such children in terms of access to schools. If the Minister is open to constructive change, this is the type of amendment I will seek to have made to the Bill on Committee Stage.  There is a track record in this area and we should adopt a similar progressive approach.</P>
    <P>The stranglehold of the Minister for Education and Science on the education system is consolidated by the abandonment of the regional education boards.  It is strange to see this being done by a Minister whose main criticism of his predecessor was that she sought to wield excessive power over the system.  With the abandonment of the regional education boards has gone the hope for locally responsive support services which recognise that many issues vitally affecting education transcend the individual school.  Such services are particularly important for disadvantaged children where the school alone cannot address their needs.</P>
    <P>This vacuum was rightly diagnosed by the OECD in its l991 report.  It will become much greater as the withdrawal of the religious communities from education accelerates in the future. A strong centralised bureaucracy will find itself more and more unable to respond to the differing <Col N="1297" /> needs of different communities as it seeks to impose its deadening uniformity.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the Bill has been broadly welcomed and people are happy with it. It is significant that the people who have not welcomed it are those who carry a particular responsibility for catering for the needs of people with a disadvantage and those who represent parents.  By adjusting his ambitions to meet the demands of some well organised groups within the system, the Minister has lost sight of the needs of parents and those with a disadvantage.  I am not advocating that we should turn the clock back and have regional boards.  I accept the Minister's decision to pull back from these boards. When one reflects on them, perhaps regional boards were too ambitious.  The idea of making a regional board the sole budget holder, the establishment of elaborate committees, the strong control on the recognition of schools and an autonomous inspectorate were a bridge too far in terms of creating new local structures.  However, the Minister has thrown out the baby with the bath water and diluted the clear line of responsibility imposed on a locally accountable board to provide support services and do many of the things we will have to develop through partnership at local level in the future.  We need to rethink some of the changes the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>While it may be good politics to include section 7 which deals with consultation with national organisations, many of those involved in education at the coalface know that consultation with national organisations is no substitute for real local dialogue and accountability.  The Minister must rethink those aspects of the Bill.  I will look for the inclusion of a framework which we can use to develop devolved educational power and budgets in the future.  This cannot be achieved, as the Minister suggested, by not doing anything legally and not providing a framework.  We must provide an enabling framework which can over time be used as a vehicle to devolve powers and budgets to schools and local regional education centres which come together.  That is the way we will evolve organically, and not by walking away from the excessive centralisation of the system and pretending that with the inclusion in the Bill of a three line section dealing with consultation between the Minister and people in the education system our hero has bounded free.  That is not an adequate response to the cogent criticism in l991 which has been restated by many of those dealing with children with a particular disadvantage and parents who naturally believe they will lose out in terms of local accountability and democratic input.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill has shied away from developing a coherent structure for the systematic pursuit of quality in the education system. For example, it does not recognise that developing the talents and skills of the teaching force should be a key objective of the system.  Its approach to the auditing of standards in the school is very old fashioned.  The participation of <Col N="1298" /> the partners in the school is not provided for in these audits which will be at the direction of the Minister, to whom the results will be sent.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for resources to address quality improvement where defects are identified. This approach, with its emphasis on judgmental, outside control of quality, needs to be changed so that all partners inside and outside the school will embrace quality improvement as a shared objective with a process which is reaffirming to those involved.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by the sections dealing with the inspectorate.  Many provisions in these sections are framed in a positive way but many others are extremely disappointing.  They refer to a dawn raid type approach to quality control where inspectors arrive at a school, there is no consultation, the parents are not involved and the reports prepared by the inspectors are sent back to the Minister.  That sort of thinking is light years away from what is needed in terms of the approach to quality control.  The Minister must look again at those elements so that there is a much more positive and reaffirming approach to quality improvement.  The Minister will be aware from the submissions he has received from various sectors that that is precisely the critique being offered.  There is no indication in the Bill that there will be resources to deal with defects in schools and that quality improvement will be a shared responsibility with diagnosis and critique and the crucial element of rebuilding and putting resources back into schools which have problems.</P>
    <P>Although educational disadvantage is the issue which should most prominently exercise the minds of policy makers at present, the Bill pays little more than lip service to the issue.  It proposes the establishment of a committee, which is welcome, but that committee will be no more than a talking shop.  When we consider, for example, the scope given to the Combat Poverty Agency to promote innovative approaches to deal with educational disadvantage, it is surprising similar powers are not given to this committee.</P>
    <P>Anyone working in the city will be aware that if we are to address educational disadvantage we will have to go beyond the school system.  With the abandonment of regional boards there is no replacement vehicle to consider the wider partnerships that are necessary.  If the Minister is serious about dealing with educational disadvantage through this committee he must give it the mandate to develop pilot programmes in a proactive way and bring together agencies in co-operative structures to consider the problem of educational drop-out.</P>
    <P>The most successful experiments in recent times in the city have had nothing to do with the education system.  They have been often undertaken by poorly funded community employment projects which considered, for example, after school activities with children, bringing them out of the school context and getting them involved in projects and activities which are of advantage <Col N="1299" /> to them.  That has changed children's approach to education.  Experts dealing in particular with difficult children are aware that the best way to approach the issue is through a positive project-oriented approach to education.</P>
    <P>There is no new thinking in the Bill on the problems of educational disadvantage.  It simply codifies existing thinking on the matter, which is admirable but is not innovative.  The Minister made one crack in the dam by establishing the committee on disadvantage, but he should go a step further and give it real powers and resources so that it can foster innovative approaches to disadvantage.  That would be a significant development and would be widely welcomed.  It is not sufficient to hope that a national organisation will solve the problem, but perhaps it will foster in local communities the adoption of broader approaches to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is surprising there is no provision in the Bill dealing with the essential role of schools in providing guidance services designed to help students participate fully in the wider world.  As an outsider &mdash; I am relatively new to this portfolio &mdash; reading about the functions of the school and the objectives of the system, I am surprised there is no recognition that at the end of the day pupils who have to participate in the wider world and find employment must have the support of guidance as well as teaching.  The representative organisation for guidance counsellors was similarly surprised.  I am sure on Committee Stage the Minister will correct that imbalance.  It is vital that schools equip children for the challenges of life, many of which in the workplace are light years away from the present style of teaching.</P>
    <P>The great emphasis in the future will be on teamwork, the ability to lead groups and co-operation in managing change and setting objectives for groups, which is not encouraged in our education system.  There is still excessive emphasis on the competitive silent work of the individual studying his or her books.  We need to look afresh at the education system and let the winds of change that are sweeping industry also sweep the education system.  There is no hint in the Bill of new thinking in that regard.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Labour Government in Britain in terms of education are remarkable.  The standard of schools in that country is so low that they had to start thinking radically.  Not only are they measuring performance of schools, setting real numeracy targets and establishing league tables, but they have invited local industry to manage schools that are not up to acceptable standards.  Such an approach by a Labour Government shows that change is sweeping the world.  That would have been anathema to Labour thinking in Britain five years ago.  It is interesting that the reaction of many unions in Britain has been hostile to the proposal by the British Minister for Education.  I read with interest a comment from a prominent trade unionist who spoke about the need for change, <Col N="1300" /> innovation and variety in the education system, and the only response from the trade union was that uniformity has always been equivalent to equality of opportunity.  If we continue to think along the lines that equality of opportunity requires uniformity, with everyone doing the same thing, the prospect is bleak.</P>
    <P>We can learn from the British in terms of our education system.  That is not to say our system is comparable to theirs &mdash; they have allowed their system to slip very far &mdash; but we should learn from the radical change under way in other countries.  As we struggle to maintain our competitive education system we must be alert and acknowledge what is happening elsewhere.  One of the duties of the inspectorate will be to make international comparisons, which is welcome.  We have been much too insular in our thinking on the education system.  I hope the work of the inspectorate will be properly resourced.  The OECD has criticised the Department for its lack of comparative analysis of the education system with approaches adopted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes changes are necessary in the Bill.  I will deal with four areas where I will seek changes on Committee Stage, although that does not mean I will put down only four amendments.  A clear obligation should be imposed on the Minister for Education and Science to provide for special education needs of children and systematically remove obstacles in their way.  I will seek to have that done in such a way that the Minister will report back on an annual basis on what is being done.  The school plan should include consideration of special needs and ways of resolving those issues.  The Minister has ultimate responsibility for this matter.  Responsibility is vague at national level and is shunted down to the school.</P>
    <P>A framework must be put in place so that moneys and powers are devolved to local partnerships, schools and education centres as vehicles for the future development of a more decentralised and democratic education system. Over time we should ensure there are resources in the regions so that schools see it as being in their interests to co-operate.  In that way the organic development for which the Minister hopes will be realised.  The pump could be primed by throwing water into it initially and hopefully in time there will be a response in terms of co-operation by schools.  That will be particularly important in towns where there is obvious need for co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will seek the establishment of an education ombudsman with a wide-ranging remit to deal with the grievances of parents and students.  I am not happy with the convoluted scheme proposed by the Minister or with his presumption that agreement is needed by all partners before an ombudsman is appointed.  He has sold out there on the rights of parents and students.  He should go for a much simpler approach of an education ombudsman.  It is laughable to see the Secretary General of his Department receiving complaints from schools and setting up committees.  In this <Col N="1301" /> day and age where the thinking around ombudsmen is well established &mdash; every industry in the country with a significant number of clients is moving towards that thinking &mdash; the Minister and his Department should be thinking along those lines also, and making it clear that it is totally independent of the Department, the Minister, his officials and the schools.</P>
    <P>We should look again at the Committee on Educational Disadvantage and give it powers to pilot new approaches.  This committee was a welcome addition to the armoury, and I would like to see it developed.</P>
    <P>On Parts II and IV, the Minister has decided to weaken the sections relating to the establishment of boards.  The previous Bill did not qualify the establishment of a board to where practicable, but it did recognise the need for agreement and a transition, and it did provide ultimately for a possible sanction of freezing funds where boards were not established.  I share the concern of those who fear that this change, which the Minister has made, might be used to unreasonably avoid the appointment of a board.  While I recognise the rights of patrons to preserve their ethos, for example, I do not see that having no board is a necessary response to preserving that ethos, if that is the concern.  We need more creative thinking about structures in this area.</P>
    <P>While it is welcome to see an obligation on boards to have a coherent policy on admission, it is very surprising that no similar requirement has been established for a policy on suspension because many parents feel that very varied criteria are applied by different schools in this area. Parents have a rightful expectation that there should be uniformity and coherence in what is done in this area.  If we go the ombudsman route, one of the benefits will not be just the cases with which he or she deals but the whole change in culture within the school which will follow from the establishment of an ombudsman.  That is why it is a very important amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not tell me that he will provide for suspension in the school attendance Bill, which would seem to be still in the fourth division as far as the priority rankings of the Government's legislative programme are concerned.  This is the time to do it.  If the Minister has serious things to do, I, as a Minister who probably made the error of not doing things early enough in a shortterm, advise him that when he has a Bill before the House and there is broad support across the House he should grab it and include additional provisions because he may never get to see some of these Bills, which are further down the ranking, reach the light of day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good that school functions should include staff development needs, but it is very surprising that they do not figure elsewhere in the Bill.  One of the functions of the education system is the development of its people, it should be an obligation of the Minister and provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the requirement to produce a report on performance available to the education authority and parents is gone.  That is not compensated for by making plans every five years.  That is a pretty important right of parents. The philosophy of the Bill seems to be that parents are somewhat less than equal partners.  There is something of a residual belief that parents are there to be tolerated and not really embraced as equal partners, that if they are given too much rope they will be vexatious in complaining about everything, and that if they are allowed to go to an ombudsman it will drag the school into all sorts of controversy.  That is a pity.</P>
      <P>I would like to see parents put far more squarely in the picture.  When an inspector is carrying out an audit of a school, parents should be among the first to be consulted.  Every year parents should be asked by the school how they feel the year went.  They should fill in a questionnaire. They should make comments on the performance of the teachers and these should go to the principal.  We must be much more open about all this. There seems to be a belief, particularly among some of the representatives of teachers at national level, that if one starts to measure things, ask questions and make public performance there will be unfair comparisons of a school in Darndale, for example, to a school in Clontarf.  That is not necessary.  It could happen, if one abused measurement or misused a vehicle which can be a very powerful tool for quality improvement.  Of course if one misuse any tool, one can have a bad outcome.  If we went down the route of having crude comparisons of Darndale versus Clontarf, one would only reinforce the difficulties of schools in difficult areas, but we can be much more imaginative.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister found it necessary, for example, to introduce a ban in the Bill on the publication of examination results.  That is just another example of this view that secrecy and keeping a lid on it is a good approach.  We need to be much more open and inclusive.</P>
      <P>I am puzzled at why the Minister has given the psychological services to the inspectorate.  To have the inspectors also as developers of psychological services seems an uneasy combination, but maybe I have missed something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the section on examinations makes no reference to the rights of students.  It is all about administration, procedure and penalties, and there is nothing about rights and the positive <Col N="1303" /> virtue of examinations.  I am surprised, equally, that it does not push out the boat about new ways of assessing performance.  It looks to be cast in the old ways of traditional mark-based examinations whereas of course we need to move towards team and project working to have an education system which mirrors the sort of challenges of the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statutory recognition of the NCCA, but I am surprised that it is not being given the power to appoint staff with a more hands on role in implementing curriculum change.  There will be questions about its membership.  There is a belief that it should be a more broadly based membership, particularly representing what might be loosely called the third strand, those who represent the people &mdash; not national organisations of parents, teachers, etc. &mdash; who are not doing well out of the system or who are having difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to an interesting debate on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will, as he said, take amendments on board because I was disappointed that the last time we had a Bill here which I regarded as sensible amendments were not accepted.  Perhaps that was because we had two Ministers handling the Bill at different stages and the arguments were lost in the exchange, but I look forward to making a contribution on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That an Education Bill is long since needed is not in dispute.  Therefore, in principle this Bill is to be welcomed.  The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, has a number of distinguishing features.  It is a Bill which is designed not to raise any hackles.  It is minimalist and singularly devoid of vision.  Its lack of creativity is an appalling response to a period of unparalleled potential and challenge in Irish education at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>The Bill is underpinned by cuteness as distinct from flair, incisiveness and decisiveness.  It is incomprehensible that any Minister for Education and Science, who even vaguely subscribes to the concept of partnership and inclusiveness in education, could produce an Education Bill which does not impose a statutory obligation to introduce boards of management.  To the best of my knowledge, there are well in excess of one hundred schools at second level which do not have boards of management.  The Minister has chosen to funk the issue and intends to allow a situation to continue where parents and teachers have no formal role in the management of these schools. In an educational sense, the Minister has chosen to disenfranchise the many rather than the few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system is, by and large, slow to change.  In this Bill, his first major legislative challenge, the Minister has signalled in no uncertain manner that he does not intend to be a catalyst for real change against the background of a rapidly changing social order and a growing marginalised <Col N="1304" /> underclass.  He is proceeding down the road of conservatism which he perceives to be the safest route.  Worse still, unlike his predecessor, Niamh Bhreathnach, he totally rejects decentralisation and opts instead for the continuation of a model inherited &mdash; with the exception of the Vocational Education Act, 1930 &mdash; from the British.</P>
    <P>The monolith in Marlboro Street is alive and well, with its future assured if the Minister has his way.  This exercise is about providing a statutory basis to existing systems rather than encouraging real partnership, transparency and accountability. What should have been an exercise in partnership and innovation will just be more of the same.  This occurs against the background of a budget which provided the princely additional sum of £500,000 for the provision of school books at primary level as the only addition to capitation or budgets in mainstream first and second level schools.  The <i>status quo</i> remains the net position for such schools under this Minister and they will not receive additional funding.</P>
    <P>It must always be the fundamental objective of any Government to achieve optimum value for money for taxpayers in the context of every service provided.  The Education budget is of the order of £2 billion.  In terms of the State's finances, this is a considerable sum of money.  It goes without saying that co-ordination, streamlining and integration of services to obtain maximum output must be addressed at all times.</P>
    <P>In the interpretation section of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, there is a clear illustration of where the legislation is fundamentally flawed.  I refer to the definition in the new Bill of the term, &ldquo;support services&rdquo;, which are defined as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;support services&rdquo; means the services which the Minister provides to students or their parents, schools or centres for education in accordance with section 7 and shall include any or all of the following:</P>
    <P>(a) assessment of students;</P>
    <P>(b) psychological services;</P>
    <P>(c) technical aid and equipment for students with special needs and their families;</P>
    <P>(d) provision for primary or post-primary education to students with special needs otherwise than in schools or centres for education; (e) teacher welfare services;</P>
    <P>(f) curriculum support and staff advisory services, and</P>
    <P>(g) such other services as are specified by this Act or considered</P>
    <P>appropriate by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the Education Bill, 1997 introduced by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, the interpretation of &ldquo;support services&rdquo; was as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" />&ldquo;support services&rdquo; means the services which an education board provides to students or their parents, recognised schools or centres for education in its education region in accordance with section 9 (2) (b) and shall include the following:</P>
    <P>(a) assessment of students;</P>
    <P>(b) psychological services;</P>
    <P>(c) technical aid and equipment for students with special needs and their families;</P>
    <P>(d) provision for primary or post primary education to students with special needs otherwise than in schools or centres for education;</P>
    <P>(e) management services;</P>
    <P>(f) industrial relations services;</P>
    <P>(g) legal services;</P>
    <P>(h) teacher welfare services;</P>
    <P>(i) curriculum support and staff advisory services;</P>
    <P>(j) library and media services;</P>
    <P>(k) school maintenance services, and</P>
    <P>(l) such other services as are specified by this Act or considered appropriate by the board or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The range of support services which were to be provided under the Bill produced by Niamh Bhreathnach have been decimated and the following services have been omitted: management services, industrial relations services, legal services and library and media services.  The Education (No. 2) Bill is even worse when compared to the earlier Bill which states that support services &ldquo;shall include the following&rdquo;&mdash; in reference to the long list of services &mdash; while the new Bill, with its greatly reduced list, states that support services &ldquo;shall include any or all of the following&rdquo;.  One must ask what remains?  The answer is that there will be fewer services, which will be centralised in the Minister's Department, and under the proposed legislation he does not even have to provide all of these services.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government deem this legislation appropriate for first and second level education in Ireland in the 21st century.  It is nothing short of a shameful funk, devoid of any real spirit of partnership.  We are presented with a sterile bankrupt philosophy of education.  There is no dynamic.  This is just plodding on with nothing more than cosmetic adjustment to the inherited British model.  Niamh Bhreathnach's Bill was inspired by real vision of partnership.  It raised hackles and it did not seek to please everyone.  The Education (No. 2) Bill, in seeking to offend no one, is bland and completely misses the wonderful opportunity presented.  In effect, it does a violence to future generations and blights the prospect of real partnership in education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> The issues surrounding the huge difference between the definition of support services in both Bills are at the kernel of difference between the creative progress the earlier Bill would have brought about had it become an Act and the paralysis the new Bill represents.  The education system requires leadership and direction.  It is primarily in the Minister's care and no amount of glib PR work can conceal the fact that the Government lacks the courage to challenge the system and release the creative energy emanating from the positive synergies between the partners in education into the system at first and second level.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is new and outlines the functions of the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) Each of the following shall be a function of the Minister under the Act:</P>
    <P>(a) to determine national education policy, and</P>
    <P>(b) to plan and co-ordinate&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the provision of education in recognised schools and centres for education, and</P>
    <P>(ii) support services.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4)(b) states that the Minister:</P>
    <P>shall, wherever practicable, consult with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers and such other persons who have a special interest in or knowledge of matters relating to education as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from real partnership in education when compared with section 27 of the earlier Bill which charged the directors of education boards with producing an education plan as soon as may be after they were appointed and at such intervals as may be specified by the Minister.  The plan would set out the objectives to be achieved by the education board in the three years following its preparation or in such other periods as may be specified by the Minister, the priorities accorded to these objectives and the means by which they would be met by the education boards.</P>
    <P>Niamh Bhreathnach's Bill further provided that:</P>
    <P>(3) The education board shall, in accordance with such directions as may be given by the Minister, consult with the parents, patrons, students, teachers and other persons or bodies likely to be affected by the plan or who have an interest in the plan in the education region concerned, on the plan as prepared by the Director.</P>
    <P>(4) The education board may, having regard to the consultation as provided by subsection (3) either approve of an education plan without <Col N="1307" /> modification or following appropriate consultation with the Director approve of the education plan submitted under this section with such modifications as it thinks fit to make.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>(6) An education board shall ensure that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a copy of the education plan is given to each school in its education region</P>
    <P>(b) a copy is made available at the main office of the education board for inspection by any person who wishes to inspect it</P>
    <P>(c) access to the plan for the purpose of inspecting it is given to such person or persons during normal office hours</P>
    <P>(d) a reasonable number of copies of the plan are deposited in each public library in the education region and,</P>
    <P>(e) copies of the plan are available for sale to the public at a reasonable charge</P>
    <P>(7) The Director of an education board shall review the education plan annually and shall make a report on the plan to the education board which may amend the plan on the basis of that report.</P>
    <P>(8) An education board shall provide the Minister with a copy of the report made by the Director under subsection (7) as soon as practicable after it has considered it together with a copy of any amendments to the education plan arising from it.</P>
    <P>I stress the education system has served the country exceedingly well.  Irish people are among the best educated in the world.  The previous Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, informed the House of an international report which concluded that Ireland was second only to Singapore in the contribution made by education to the competitiveness of its economy.  However, we cannot stand still and, while building on success, we must adapt and manage change.</P>
    <P>It is timely to quote from a speech the Minister's predecessor made in the House in May 1996 when she described the Department of Education as follows:</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is overwhelmed with the day-to-day business of the education system, a system in which more than 1 million students and teachers are involved every day.  The Department, through sheer pressure of business, is seen as bureaucratic, unresponsive and slow.  Communities develop a dependency culture while waiting for a central Department to make decisions.  Partnership in planning for education is stifled.  Competition rather than co-operation between different schools can result.  This is why now, more than ever, we need decentralised structures in education.  Given the maturity of our educational <Col N="1308" /> system in the 1990s there is now the need to look afresh at the administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>Has the position changed to any extent since that speech was made less than two years ago?  Is there no less need now for decentralisation in the Department?  Does the Minister accept that the Bill offends in a very profound way against the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and endorsed in the Amsterdam Treaty?  In what way is the Bill anything more than a touching up of our centralised system of administration which originated in the 19th century?</P>
    <P>When the Department of Education was established in 1924 and assumed responsibility for all national secondary and technical education, it took over the existing system.  The Vocational Education Act, 1930, was positive and effective devolution.  However, we now find ourselves with a unique level of centralisation as against that which pertains in the rest of Europe.  The Minister is refusing to follow best international practice in education matters which matches need and distinct traditions in education systems.</P>
    <P>We need a model which would confine the Department to areas such as overall policy matters, curriculum supervision and quality assurance.  It should also devolve administrative matters such as staffing, school building provision and developing linkages with the business community to the regions.  On Committee Stage the Labour Party will seek to substantially amend this Bill.  We will seek in our amendments to introduce decentralisation, accountability and transparency to legislation which looks back rather than forward and challenges nothing.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on one of the functions of a school listed in the Bill.  This function is to &ldquo;promote the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students in consultation with their parents having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; needs much more precise definition. Although the Minister in his contribution went some distance down this road, I still find the concept he presents to be very vague.  In addition this function replaces the function in the previous Bill &mdash; to &ldquo;provide social, personal and health education for students&rdquo;.  Why was the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; dropped?  Why has the function changed from the specific &ldquo;provide . education&rdquo; to the vague &ldquo;promote . development&rdquo;.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Part III, section 13(2)(iv) relating to the functions of an inspector states that the inspector &ldquo;shall advise parents and parents' associations&rdquo;. The previous Bill provided only for advising parents' associations.  Why has the Minister brought about this change in drafting and is there a danger that the inspector could have an inordinate amount of his or her time taken up with discharging these functions to the detriment of other duties?  Why is there no specified function for the inspectorate in the provision of inservice training? <Col N="1309" />  Will he put down an appropriate amendment in this regard?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why in section14(5), relating to the establishment and membership of boards of management, the phrase &ldquo;which has an appropriate gender balance&rdquo; has been dropped?  It seems the Government and the Minister have been exposed for their total lack of commitment to gender balance.  I call on the Minister to restore the phrase on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 15(2)(g), which refers to the functions of boards of management, states that a board, in carrying out its functions, shall &ldquo;within the resources provided to the school in accordance with section 12, make reasonable provision and accommodation for students with special educational needs&rdquo;.  This is an extraordinarily weak subsection and effectively confers no rights on students with special needs.  The section requires substantial strengthening if it is to have any worthwhile impact and I await the Minister's response on this.  The Labour Party will accept nothing less than the proper addressing of provision and accommodation for students with special needs.</P>
    <P>Section 18(2) deals with the keeping of accounts and records.  It states:</P>
    <P>(2) Accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall be made available by the school concerned for inspection by the Minister in so far as those accounts relate to moneys provided in accordance with section 12.</P>
    <P>There are moneys voted by the Oireachtas whereas the Bill introduced by the previous Minister states:</P>
    <P>49.  (1) A board shall keep, in such form as may be approved of by the education board, all proper and usual accounts and records of all income received by it or expenditure of such moneys incurred by it.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister, in this era of public accountability, excluding accounting for donations from the accounts of boards of management?</P>
    <P>Section 30(2)(b), (c) and (d), which deals with the curriculum, raises the question of a clear and concise definition of &ldquo;characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo;.  Section 32 deals with educational disadvantage, but does not define it.  It is imperative that all the partners in education understand what the legislation means by educational disadvantage.  Why does the Bill omit any reference to further education?  Does the Minister intend to introduce separately a further education authority?  Does he not agree this extremely important segment of the second level sector urgently requires co-ordination and direction?</P>
    <P>I am also puzzled by a term &ldquo;staff associations&rdquo; which appears in Part III, section 13(7), Part IV, section 14(1), Part VI, section 25 and section 28(1).  This term is not defined in the interpretation section of Part I and did not appear in the Education Bill, 1997.  How does this inclusion improve the Bill and what does it mean?  Who <Col N="1310" /> do the staff associations represent?  Have they a negotiating licence because the Bill seems to involve them in industrial relations areas?</P>
    <P>Many people, including myself, are concerned about children who are young offenders, very disruptive in school or generally out of control.  The schools cannot deal effectively with such children. It appears that some 1,000 children annually do not make the transition from first to second level and many others leave the education system at a very young age.  There is a serious deficit of parenting skills in the community.  As a primary teacher I believe dysfunctional children can be identified by teachers at an early age.  The antisocial behaviour of such dysfunctional children can be effectively addressed only in a family context and the sooner this is done the better.  I have long believed that there should be at least one school welfare officer in each VEC area.  Such officers should have the backing of statute law in being enabled to co-ordinate the various statutory and voluntary organisations which would have a role in resolving the difficulties of dysfunctional children in a family context.  The problems relating to these dysfunctional children are multi-faceted and require a co-ordinated multifaceted response.  Without such a dedicated devolved response, no meaningful widespread progress will be made.</P>
    <P>To say the Bill is disappointing is a major understatement.  I look forward to Committee Stage where I will seek by amendment to develop real partnership in education.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that following the passage of the Bill he would review the establishment of county education fora.  Basically, he is saying he is prepared to consider the establishment of institutions that would have no base in legislation.  If the Minister intends to do that, he should introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  When the word &ldquo;fora&rdquo; is decoded, it suggests talking shops.  Such fora should have a more solid base and even though this is much less than what the Labour Party would seek, it would be progressive.  However, institutions set up after the legislation has been enacted will not have the necessary teeth and would have limited value in education.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that the number of places for young offenders is inadequate.  The system, inasmuch as it relates to such offenders, is too fragmented.  The Department of Education and Science should be the lead Department in dealing with those people.  Children as young as nine and ten &mdash; even a small number of them &mdash; can wreak havoc in communities.  From their point of view they are on a trail to nowhere and will merely go further down the road of offending.  While there is certain sympathy in the Bill for that group, real structures must be put in place because those children have a huge detrimental effect on the educational system.  They are part of a system which has difficulty coping with them.</P>
    <P>The Bill is disappointing, but the Labour Party will table constructive amendments on Committee <Col N="1311" /> Stage.  I hope there can be an effective meeting of minds in the select committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill.  It is the second landmark Bill in the education area published by the Minister since he came to office and I commend him for that.  Many of us will recall that until relatively recently teachers were guided by a dog-eared book covering the rules and procedures for national schools which was kept in the principal's office and governed by the operation of circular letter.  As other speakers pointed out, the last significant legislation on education to come before the Dáil was the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  It is extraordinary that some speakers can laud the benefits of that Act while at the same time try to decimate the bodies set up under it.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the legislators who built up the education system, of which we are justly proud. The introduction of free second level education and other initiatives was visionary.  I also pay tribute to staff who work in the institution in Marlborough Street which many of us in the teaching profession treat with caution and suspicion.  They were enlightened, creative and sometimes eccentric, but they brought to the education process a diversity which reflects well on all of us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce a freeing-up mechanism.  He talked about encouraging organic development and diversity.  The Bill is not prescriptive in its approach.  It encourages partnership, which many of us have sought for a long time, and it will enhance the autonomy of schools.</P>
      <P>I want to speak briefly about the Minister's decision not to go down the road of regional education boards.  That decision will be greeted by a sigh of relief from many parent and teacher groups and management bodies.  Those of us involved in education until recently decided that if regional education boards were set up we would try to work with them.  However, many of us believe they would have extended the dead hand of bureaucracy and that the £40 million could be used more usefully in resourcing schools. I also welcome the development of local fora, to which Deputy O'Shea referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased at the reference to early childhood education in the Bill.  We are relatively recent converts to the importance of early childhood education.  In Dublin community play-groups have been set up by parents, officials of Dublin Corporation and statutory bodies, all of whom have done tremendous work.  Latterly we have witnessed the setting up of early start programmes.  These contribute greatly to countering many deficiencies in the education system, including poor parenting, lack of social skills which many children experience and various levels of deprivation.  I commend the Minister on his decision to set up a forum on early childhood education, on which I look forward to a constructive <Col N="1312" /> debate.  The models in operation for delivering early childhood education have many positive aspects which commend them but are not the only models we can follow.</P>
    <P>To have to write in anything about disadvantage in an Education Bill is almost an admission of failure on the part of all of us to treat the children of the nation equally.  It is important that the Minister acknowledges the need for special provision in the area of disadvantage.  Special financial measures are required in this area.  Disadvantaged schools, which by definition are located in areas of high unemployment and poor social skills, find it extremely difficult to raise money. Such schools do not have access to industry in the same way as schools in better off areas.  Positive discrimination must be made for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the special committee to look at questions of disadvantage.  It is only by targeted initiatives that we can address the issues discussed at the Joint Committee on Education and Science recently, for example, early school leaving, disruptive behaviour, low levels of educational attainment etc.  It is important that provision is made for these areas.</P>
    <P>The breaking the cycle initiative is important but we need to be even more focused than that. There are a relatively small number of areas throughout the country which are severely disadvantaged.  Those areas need a whole range of resources targeted at them, whether at parents, teachers or even buildings.  We may have failed in recent times by allowing the ripples of disadvantage status to extend outwards so that everybody is getting a little of the resources.  I would much prefer if some of the £40 million saved here was used to reduce class sizes right across the board and to target intensively measures to alleviate disadvantage in severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>An issue arose at the joint committee which merits consideration but it may be more of an administrative matter.  Many of us are aware that children from disadvantaged areas attend schools on the fringes of disadvantaged areas.  Unfortunately, they are going into a school of larger class sizes where there are no home-school co-ordinators, remedial teachers and resource teachers unless the local community buys in those resources.  When talking about disadvantage, we need to look at that group.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke to the staff of a school where 60 per cent of its intake comes from an adjacent area which has disadvantaged status and yet it cannot get any form of positive discrimination for its school.  With the aid of the Bill, schools will have to learn they are involved in a multi-agency approach.  The day is long gone when schools could do everything.  In my earlier years when studying for my H.Dip at Trinity College, I did a minor thesis on the role of the school in the community.  Last night and the previous night I was leafing through it to remind myself of the deep thoughts I had in those days.  A school can do much for a community.  It cannot engineer a <Col N="1313" /> community, nor should it be expected to do so, but it can animate a community and many teachers have been effective in doing that.  Where it has been successful it is being done on a multi-agency approach.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to admissions policy.  Many of us over the years will have had great difficulty in trying to ensure a smooth progression from primary to post-primary schools without entrance examinations.  The whole assessment process at primary and post-primary education needs to be linked.  Children who transfer from the primary sector, a child centred education system, to the post-primary sector, a more exam-based system, need to have a system developed where they can transfer more readily.  I for one will not shed tears when I see the back of entrance exams.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill to the links needed between primary and post-primary schools.  This is where the local fora can be effective.  For many 12 year old children the transfer from primary to post-primary schools is traumatic.  They move from relating with one teacher to as many as seven or eight in the post-primary sector.  They leave primary school in July and in September they are in a much different situation. Some children lose momentum and there is a lack of progression in their educational achievement. I encourage the Minister to develop mechanisms to establish links between primary and post-primary schools to enable a greater understanding of the difficulties which young people experience when transferring from primary to post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the inspectorate.  I am old enough to remember an inspector, who shall be nameless, who came into a school one Monday morning and wondered why the class which knew &ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo; could not sing or play &ldquo;Fáinne Geal an Lae&rdquo;.  Recently, we have developed a more enlightened inspectorate.  The functions of the inspector, as outlined in the Bill, are encouraging.  The Bill states that an inspector shall visit recognised schools and centres for education and evaluate their management and the quality and effectiveness of the education provided in them including the quality of teaching and effectiveness of individual teachers; evaluate the education standards; assess the implementation of regulations made by the Minister and report to the Minister on these matters; advise teachers and boards of management in respect of the performance of their duties and, in particular, assist teachers in employing improved methods of teaching and conducting classes; advise parents, and parents' associations &mdash; this is a significant and positive development &mdash; may conduct assessments of the educational needs of students in recognised schools and advise those students, their parents and the schools as appropriate in relation to their educational development.</P>
    <P>Much time has been lost in putting in place a school psychological service which has been long <Col N="1314" /> sought.  Deputy O'Shea mentioned disruptive and dysfunctional pupils, many of whom could have been dealt with effectively if such a service was provided earlier.  It takes only one or two pupils to disrupt a classroom or school.</P>
    <P>I am delighted teachers may be seconded to the inspectorate.  In recent times they have been seconded on an informal basis.  Stay Safe co-ordinators, sex education programme advisers, and home-school-community liaison co-ordinators fall into this category.  It is a pity that more teachers have not had the opportunity to share their expertise and advice with colleagues.  They may be far better received than members of the traditional inspectorate who are seen as more lofty characters and not as enlightened as some of their peers.</P>
    <P>On the issue of expulsions and suspensions, every Member has on his or her file correspondence concerning up to 20 intractable cases where young people have been excluded from schools. It is extraordinarily difficult to reintegrate them in another school.  This is unsatisfactory.  I have great sympathy for the school principal who is left with no other option but to exclude a student from a school and for the exasperated parent who tries without success to find a placement for their young adult in another school.  The provision in the Bill is convoluted but will be welcomed by parents nonetheless.  The process needs to be transparent and coherent.</P>
    <P>The questions of school attendance, exclusions, expulsions and suspensions are inextricably linked.  Disadvantage and geographical location are not the only factors.  Expulsions and suspensions occur as often in affluent areas as in areas of great need.</P>
    <P>The policy on children with special needs which has been in place for some time is presenting difficulties for teachers and parents.  There is a need to provide extra resources.  The special needs of gifted children also need to be looked at.  Groups such as An Óige Tréitheach do great work.</P>
    <P>Alternative school models such as the youth encounter projects need to be looked at.  The Minister is anxious not to have prescriptive models.  There is a need for organic development whereby schools can develop links with communities as well as other schools.</P>
    <P>It is commendable that adult education is mentioned in the Bill.  Some extraordinary initiatives have been taken by local groups.  I compliment Sheila Conroy, the People's College, the National College of Industrial Relations and community education co-ordinators throughout the country for the unbelievable work they have done during the years.</P>
    <P>The establishment of students councils in post-primary schools is a progressive move.  This will give students an opportunity to understand the democratic process, although it may cause many problems for school managements and principals. I am delighted provision is made for parental involvement, in keeping with the concept of equal partnership first advocated by Deputy O'Rourke, <Col N="1315" /> as Minister for Education, in 1987 when she provided seed funding for parents' associations which have gone from strength to strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Few Bills have had such a long lead-in.  This Bill has been coming for a long time. Educationists have been commenting for years that the education system does not have a statutory basis.  A Green Paper was published in 1992 which was the subject of lengthy discussions with all those involved in education.  This was followed by the publication of a White Paper, the Education Convention at Dublin Castle, rounds of consultations between the many bodies involved in education and the then Minister and the Department, the publication of the Education (No. 1) Bill, a further round of consultations with the Minister and the publication of the Education (No. 2) Bill.  We were entitled to expect that this Bill would do great things for the education system.</P>
      <P>For the first time this Bill places the education system on a legislative basis.  Apart from that, I wonder what it is all about.  I have gone through it with great care to ascertain where the education system is to be reformed.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and have no doubt he will bring his well acknowledged talents and energies to the position but, from the first child of the Donogh O'Malley generation to occupy the office of Minister for Education and Science and the youngest Minister for Education and Science in the history of the State, I had expected some reforms.  I am greatly disappointed.  This legislation does no more than freeze in time the education system.  It is an accurate snapshot or still of the education system in 1998.  It is fossilising in legislation the education system as it is now without providing for any reform of the system.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill refers in a number of places to the fact that it is legislating for the <i>status quo.</i>  It is an interesting historical fact that it is establishing the education system on a legislative basis.</P>
      <P>Is it appropriate to freeze in legislation an education system which has been evolving without legislation?  What effect will that have on the evolution of the education system?  The argument could be made that our education system has evolved over time without any legislative basis.  It is responding to the needs of our society in the way it is managed and the way in which it delivers its service without any legislation and notwithstanding the degree of denominational control of the education system.  There has been participation by the different partners in the education system and changes have occurred such as the growth of gaelscoileanna and the growth in the multi-denominational and the further education sectors, particularly within the VEC system.  It is a retrograde step to superimpose legislation which does no more than simply state the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill abandons the reforms contained in the Education (No. 1) Bill advanced by the previous <Col N="1316" /> Government.  I am not a fan of the idea of regional education boards but if those boards are to be taken out of the legislation, as the Minister has done here, he should provide something in their place.  He has transferred policy making and development functions from the proposed regional education boards to the Minister, which is a retrograde step.  He has also taken out of the legislation the services which would have been provided through the regional boards &mdash; the management services, the industrial relations service, the legal service, the library and media service and the school maintenance service, all of which are necessary back-up to the schools now being charged with responsibility in law to deliver an education service to the public.</P>
    <P>Legislation is promised with regard to reform of the vocational education committees but, if the Minister intends to abandon the idea of regional education boards, he should at least replace them with some kind of structure based on local authorities or introduce reform of the vocational education committees contemporaneously with this legislation.  It will be difficult for us to address in a meaningful way the structures the Minister has in mind until we know the reforms he is planning in regard to the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect of this legislation, however, is the way in which it consolidates the <i>status quo</i> in the education system and gives it legal effect.  I am concerned about the way in which the Bill consolidates the existing power of the Minister and of the patrons of schools.  I am concerned about the way it shifts the responsibility for the delivery of the education service to the schools and shifts the burden of responsibility from the patron of the school to the board of management, the principal and the teachers.</P>
    <P>I advise every school principal, every teacher who holds a post of responsibility and every member or prospective member of a board of management to read this Bill very carefully because for the first time they will have responsibilities which are set down clearly in legislation.  I advise their trade unions and representative organisations to get their lawyers to trawl through this legislation and identify the enormous potential contained in it for teachers, principals and boards of management to end up in the courts responding to litigation based on the responsibilities being placed on them in a legal way in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we already know, and I am sure the Minister also knows, about the greater possibility of litigation in the area of education.  Some members of the legal profession appear to be trawling for cases to be taken against schools. This is part of the growth in litigation generally. This Bill will substantially increase that possibility because the legal responsibility for the delivery of the education service is being placed on the shoulders of the teachers, the principals, the schools and the boards of management.  The Minister, his Department and the patrons of the schools will be very well protected by the way <Col N="1317" /> in which this legislation is set up, but the actual deliverers of the service will be exposed with regard to the legal responsibility placed on them.</P>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise to contrast the language used in the different sections of the Bill with regard to the Minister and the responsibility on schools.  Section 6, which admittedly applies to everybody in the education service, states that the objects of the Act are to promote, contribute and enhance.  They are very aspirational terms.  In relation to the functions of the Minister, apart from the areas where he is giving himself absolute power to determine national education policy, they are well couched in providing funding as the Minister considers appropriate. In relation to all of the other functions it states that the Minister shall have regard to the resources available and to the practices, traditions and organisations.  He can consult, wherever practicable.  He is well protected by the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the functions of the schools, however, the language in the Bill moves up a grade in the degree of responsibility.  It does not refer to the schools doing things which are practicable and as resources permit.  They have to ensure that the educational needs are met, that the education complies with the requirements of the Minister, that the parents of the students have access to material and so on in those terms.  The Bill states that the principal shall provide leadership and be responsible for the many aspects of the functioning of the school.  Different language and terminology is used in relation to the functions of schools, principals and teachers from that applied in the case of the Minister or the patrons of schools.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 the Minister effectively gives himself power to determine the policy on education.  The inspectorate will be set up on a statutory basis, but I question if it was ever under threat.  The NCCA will be set up on a statutory basis which I welcome, but I did not see any mention of the course committees of the NCCA which undertake much of the material work.  The patrons' position is still copperfastened.  The Bill states the setting up of boards of management will be on a purely voluntary basis.  A patron may or may not set up a board of management.  Under the Bill power is given to patrons, admittedly with the approval of the Minister, to dismiss individual members or the boards of management.</P>
    <P>While the Bill places legal responsibilities on schools and on the providers of the service, it is silent in many respects and in other respects unclear on the relationships that exist within the school.  The relationship between the principal and the teachers is not clearly defined and is unclear.  There is no mention of what one might call the second tier of management in a school, which will be considerably enhanced as a result of the latest agreement between the Minister and the teacher unions.  That will provide for the appointment of deputy principals, assistant principals and various posts of responsibility, but they <Col N="1318" /> are not mentioned in the Bill and it is not clear what their functions will be.</P>
    <P>The Bill is silent on the critical area of discipline and the relationship between pupils and teachers.  It does not deal with the problem of bullying.  Deputies O'Shea and Carey referred to the problem of dysfunctional students.  There is a provision whereby a parent or a student who is dissatisfied about an expulsion from a school can appeal it.  I welcome that and it is an important provision, but it is not clear under what circumstances that will be granted or what are the rights of the school or the principal in relation to the discipline of students in the school.  Unwittingly one of the outcomes of this legislation may well be that the rights of appeal to the statutory responsibilities of the schools may be exercised by those who are responsible for the dysfunction in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of what happens where a child is expelled from one school and finds it difficult to get into another one.  Deputies Carey and O'Shea mentioned the many instances of children who have been expelled from one, cannot get into another and who will end up in difficult circumstances.  That area needs to be provided for.  If rules are laid down for schools, responsibilities are placed on them and there is a system where they have to exercise some discipline and control, the State and the Minister must provide for the fall back position that will apply.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not refer to a further education authority, which I know the Minister when in Opposition was keen to have established. Given our education system, the concept of education and life long learning, people returning to education and the phenomenal growth in the PLC sector and in further education generally, we need a further education authority, but that is not provided for.  There is no provision for the regulation or development of the further education sector, particularly the private sector of further education.  The Minister's long time promise to introduce some bonding legislation on private institutions was mentioned earlier and there is a need for some regulation in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to disadvantage and a debate on education would not be complete without mentioning it.  I was surprised the Minister did not refer to the national anti-poverty strategy developed by the last Government which provided for an integrated approach to tackling poverty.  The education system is important in addressing poverty and disadvantage, but it alone cannot tackle those problems.  At a practical level many of the children presenting as disadvantaged and, in some cases, as troublesome and dysfunctional in schools come from a family background where poverty is a serious problem.  It seems many of the traditional methods adopted to address the problem of proverty in education and in social services generally have not succeeded. There is a need to adopt a new approach to tackle the problem of poverty and to address educational disadvantage in that context.  As Deputy</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> O'Shea said, that will have to be done by addressing the problem at the level of the family.  The manner in which we are dealing with it at present is not working.  Through the social services and other State services we are providing different forms of intervention to address poverty.  That problem is addressed through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, health boards, housing departments of local authorities, various methods used to tackle disadvantage in schools and in some cases through the justice system.  In many cases the same people are presenting for intervention time after time and service after service.  A new approach is required to address that problem on an individual and family basis.  The national anti-poverty strategy for the first time set out an integrated and co-ordinated plan as to how that could be done.  While the Minister acknowledged disadvantage and the Bill refers to the problems of disadvantage, I am disappointed that the strategy set out by the last Government for tackling poverty and addressing it in a new way appears to be about to be abandoned.  I hope that is not the case and I ask the Minister to address that specific point when responding to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1832 the Duke of Leinster in a letter to the national board of education established the national school system.  Since then the primary schools have been governed by the structures outlined in that letter, by rules and regulations for national schools and by successive ministerial directives over the years.  In this century no substantive legislation was enacted in relation to first or second level education other than the Vocational Education Act, 1930, yet since its foundation the education system has served millions of pupils.  We have inherited a wealth of efficient structures and services which have stood the test of time.</P>
      <P>Our system is characterised by high educational expectations of practitioners in the system and of a society which has strongly valued education as far back as we can remember.  Keen parental interest, high pupil participation, the commitment of teachers and responsible management have equally played their part in making our education system successful.  Changes in society, higher educational expectations, the need for rapid change in the workplace, continued education and retraining, developments and findings in pedagogically related fields of study and the increasing incursion of technology on our lives demands the adaptation of the education system. Such a change demands leadership and creativity from the legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill recognises the core elements of the present system which has contributed to the success of education.  We need to develop the curriculum with schools and their companion organisations &mdash; parental, managerial and professional bodies &mdash; in conjunction with the State.  This Bill provides the framework for reform and development. <Col N="1320" />  It places our education system on a statutory basis and will ensure it is able to respond to the rapidly changing demands for high quality education in the next century.</P>
    <P>Education in Ireland is based on a partnership. For the first time, this legislation gives each of those partners recognition.  A separate section of the Bill deals with patrons, parents, teachers, principals, boards of management and inspectors. In recent years we have witnessed a change in the nature of the patrons of our schools.  Recognition and appreciation must be given to the religious orders who over the years have funded, financed and provided education.  Now they are faced with challenges and change.  Decreasing numbers create a challenge for us to ensure the buildings, systems, structures and management continue in an orderly fashion.  We must couple this with a vision and a determination which these orders showed in their commitment to the provision of education.</P>
    <P>The new nature of our multi-cultural society means we have a diversity of cultures and religions.  In the south city of Dublin alone, there are Jewish, Muslim, French and German schools as well as many all-Irish schools.  I welcome the recognition of the diversity of culture in this Bill. It shows people's willingness to take responsibility for their education while protecting what is best in their culture.  I am sure groups such as Educate Together welcomed the Minister's announcement last week of his support for multi-denominational schools.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives recognition to non-denominational schools, guaranteeing the choice parents need and deserve.  These parents have contributed to, and participated in, our local schools for years.  They have worked through their representative organisations and, particularly in rural areas, have been responsible for fundraising for extra classrooms or facilities.  They now have a recognised role which involves them in consultation and policy.  Parents are no longer outsiders and are full participants.  They are an integral part of the education system and their associations are now recognised.</P>
    <P>This too gives responsibility to parents.  There is a tendency for a parent representative on a board to think of his or her own child.  However, the responsibility must be on the parent to do whatever is best for the overall running of the school so that each child can benefit.  A parent must represent all parents.  We should be conscious of the fact that there is a natural inclination to protect one's own.  However, we should recognise that parents can broaden their scope and have a valuable role to play in the wider educational and management structure.</P>
    <P>Over the centuries, teaching was a highly respected profession, going back to the time of hedge schools when the schoolmaster was the most respected person in the village, a person of great learning and knowledge of the classics and the three &ldquo;rs&rdquo;.  Previous Administrations tended to forget about the role of teachers in their Education <Col N="1321" /> Bills.  However, this Bill is the first to emphasise the vital role of teachers in the school. The teacher is now no longer just the provider of an education course.  He or she is an adviser, counsellor and friend.  He or she is responsible for enforcing the curriculum but also for the personal development of the child.</P>
    <P>The teacher has to respond to changes in society and the curriculum.  He or she influences, encourages and fosters the child.  This innovative and imaginative Bill recognises the role of the teacher &mdash; a recognition which is welcomed by unions and not in previous Bills.</P>
    <P>Recognition is also given to the principal who plays a pivotal role in the daily management of a school.  The principal is the leader and he or she guides staff, creates the environment in which learning can take place and supports teachers and students.  The importance of the wording of this Bill in relation to teachers and principals is that the power and autonomy for the day-to-day running rests locally and individually with the school, without interference from the State.  There is a local responsibility to fulfil the needs of students and the community.  Over the years people have tended to think there has been too much State interference.  This Bill recognises the role of local people in administering the educational system in each school.</P>
    <P>Parents, teachers, principals and patrons come together on the board of management of each school.  Fortunately, the regional boards have been abandoned and I am delighted that neither Fine Gael nor the Democratic Left are shedding crocodile tears for their loss.  Bureacracy is gone and the money will not be wasted.  The overall effect will be to ensure that management works better at a local level.</P>
    <P>Management should be based on partnership and consensus, not on coercion.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that people should read the Bill.  They should note the words of recognition, encouragement, advice and support and the lack of coercion, pressure and threats which were evident in the previous Education Bill.  It is supportive of all those who work in education, rather than being adversarial.  This Bill is based on a consensus which underlines all school management and leads to partnership at all levels.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of teaching for 16 years and I never knew what a cigire was because I never saw one in the school.  That may be a reflection on my wonderful teaching but I suspect it has something to do with the inspectorate.  The inspectors are now on a statutory basis, which is welcome.  They will be in a position to visit, evaluate, support and assist schools and centres, and to advise parents.  They will ensure quality and effective education is provided at all levels.  They will help to improve methods and assess educational needs in a national capacity which is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Those are the groups specifically mentioned. The one heading not included is child or student. <Col N="1322" /> Teachers, parents, principals, patrons and inspectors are mentioned, but not the child.  The child is central to all aspects of this Bill.  The child is at the core of all provisions, structures and policies.  The rights of every child are recognised throughout every section of this Bill: their rights to special needs schools and the rights of children with educational disadvantage.  The type of curriculum offered, its role in the school structure, an appeals system and the security of the examination system are all covered in the Bill.  There would be no education system without the children.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have ever been involved in education recognise that there is not an adequate service to cater for children with special needs.  The dignity of each child is not sufficiently recognised. Special assistants should be allocated to schools that are willing to accept children with special needs for the duration of their education.  Many educationalists now recognise the learning and social integration which can benefit such children in ordinary schools is better than that in special schools.  The role of voluntary organisations in providing services, where we over many years have failed, must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Educational disadvantage has nothing to do with geography.  The constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which most people would recognise as not being a disadvantaged one, has a school drop out rate of 2.5 per cent compared to a national average of 0.7 per cent.  The constituency's early school leaving rate of 2.5 per cent compares to a national rate of 2.2 per cent. These figures are contained in a Nexus report for Dún Laoghaire VEC published in December 1996.</P>
    <P>It is a priority of the Government to address such problems, but it means that, to date, the Government and all local organisations have had to come together to address these specific needs. The response of the Southside Partnership, the Dún Laoghaire Youth Service and schools like Scoil Cholmcille, can reflect the capacity of wellintentioned and well-directed groups towards assisting those needs.</P>
    <P>Programmes such as early intervention are so important.  It is not good enough that Barnardo's in Loughlinstown can point out three toddlers to me and say they are the children who will end up in jail.  Unfortunately, Barnardo's is right because there is no follow through from one sector of education to another.  Early Intervention programmes in Dunedin, Mountown and Fitzgerald Park are so successful that they have immensely enhanced the value placed on learning for those children in preparing them for formal education.</P>
    <P>However, there is no communication or other link between the primary and secondary schools. It is a serious problem, particularly in cities where there is a choice of secondary schools.  It can be presumed that if a child did not end up in one secondary school they must have gone on to another, but there is no follow up if a drop out has occurred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> Equally, there is a great need for more counsellors, including guidance counsellors.  At the moment counsellors do two jobs in one, but there is a need for two people to do the separate jobs. It is a matter of regret that the system has allowed geography to determine whether a school qualifies for a remedial teacher.  A school with 600 pupils does not get a remedial teacher because of its location.  Does that mean that children, in what would be deemed a better off area, do not have any kind of learning difficulties?</P>
    <P>Education disadvantage needs to be tackled at all levels.  It is a priority of the Government to ensure it is tackled, but I am particularly concerned about the lack of links between primary and secondary level to ensure these problems are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition given in the Bill to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which is involved with curricular development.  In recent years we have witnessed a number of new courses, each of them worthy and welcome, but there are not enough hours in the school day to teach them all.  I would like to see better co-ordination of the range of courses being offered in schools.  I am particularly interested in the transition year, which is a tremendous success.  However, it is left to the individual school and the talents of individual teachers to provide the service.  Perhaps we should examine the possibility of giving a national certification for different courses.  Some students thrive in transition year because they develop extra talents, although they may not shine in the traditional exam system.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that history will remain a core curriculum subject in our schools.  It is important that our understanding of events like the Civil War is not dictated by films such as <i>Michael Collins</i> and the RTÉ programme, <i>The Madness from Within.</i></P>
    <P>Fáiltím freisin roimh an méid atá le rá faoin nGaeilge sa mBille seo.  Ó bunaíodh na scoileanna náisiúnta, tá an-dul chun cinn déanta in ainneoin gur dúradh ag an am sin nach raibh cead an Ghaeilge ná an stair a mhúineadh.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar na scoileanna anois tabhairt faoin dátheangachas, faoin teanga, cultúr, traidisiún agus litríocht a mhúineadh.  Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí béim ar labhairt na teanga agus tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh an bord nua molta seo ar na háiseanna atá ar fáil agus go mbeidh polasaí nua ann maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhbanna ann maidir le caighdeán labhartha na múinteoirí Gaeilge agus maidir le meon roinnt scoileanna a gceapann nach ionann tábhacht na Gaeilge agus tábhacht ábhar eile.  Tá fadhbanna ann maidir le daltaí cliste a gceapann nach cóir dóibh leanacht ar aghaidh leis an nGaeilge mar nach bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach leis na hábhair eile.  Tá fadhb ann maidir le tacaíocht don Ghaeilge lasmuigh de na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Molaim na scoileanna lánGhaeilge agus gaelscoileanna ach tá fadhb ann maidir le leanúnachas <Col N="1324" /> ó na bunscoileanna go dtí na hiarbhun-scoileanna, a thugann dúshlán dúinne.  Tá gá le cabhair, le hairgead, agus le cabhair rúnaíochta agus riaracháin atá geallta don bhord sa Bhille seo agus fáiltím roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an Roinn Oideachais ag obair lámh as lámh leis na heagrais Ghaeilge, go háirithe le grúpaí ar nós Gael-Linn atá ag obair leis na scoileanna ag cur imeachtaí ar nós díospóireachtaí agus Slógadh ar fáil.  Nuair a fheiceann scoláirí go bhfuil an Ghaeilge forleathan, bríomhar agus beomhar lasmuigh de na scoileanna, is ansin a dtuigfidh siad go bhfuil tábhacht agus fiúntas ag baint léi.</P>
    <P>As democracy is at the core of what we do in this House, I particularly welcome the development of school councils in all schools.  They can only serve to promote an understanding of democracy and the voting system.  I recommend every school to use the proportional representation system so pupils will realise just how difficult it is to get elected.  Students should recognise they have a wide brief and not a selfish one; they represent not just their own interests, but those of their schools as well.  They might, for example, want to introduce a smoking policy which would not be in the interests of the school, so they must adopt a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>At the end of the school term, examinations are what matter most.  The examination system must be open and honest.  It must be something over which we can stand, not just as a Legislature but as a country.  This Bill grants protection to examinations and puts the exam system on a sound statutory footing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be no league tables.  There will be no information on the overall performance of a school so there can be no comparison between schools.  What is a good school?  It is not just the one that gets results, it is also one that turns out mature adults.</P>
    <P>This Bill works on what is best in our education system and recognises our past, present and future.  The Bill has been welcomed by teachers and unions alike and it demonstrates a vision.  In 1956 the then Minister for Education stated:</P>
    <P>I regard the position of the Minister in the Department as that of a kind of dungaree man &mdash; the plumber who will make the satisfactory communications and streamline the forces and potentiality of the education workers and education management in the country.  He will take the knock out of the pipes and link up everything.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Mulcahy, was the dungaree man in 1956, this Minister, Deputy Martin, is the silicon man because of his innovation and imagination.  He is pushing our education system into the future and building on the best of what we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Other speakers said the Bill has had a long gestation period.  I was pleased to support <Col N="1325" /> the Education (No. 1) Bill which was debated before the general election.  I regret the Minister has become a prisoner of the verbosity he used when he was Opposition spokesperson for education.  This Bill is a step backwards from the first Education Bill.</P>
      <P>A cursory glance at questions tabled to the Minister for Education and Science highlights the extent to which our education system is centralised and the fact that improvements are the gift of the Minister.  The following are examples of the type of question tabled to the Minister for written reply today:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science if he will give details of the latest stage of planning of the third level college for Blanchardstown .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science if he will initiate planning for the provision of a second level school in the Mornington, Laytown and Bettystown area .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science if two teachers . can be granted leave of absence .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science when a second teacher will be supplied to a school in County Mayo .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science the position in relation to the provision of the new school at Coláiste Choilin, Swords.</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science if he will have arrangements made to ensure that an additional grant of £40,000 is made to the authorities of the new special school at Limerick .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science the decision . for the appointment of a home-school liaison teacher .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science if a school bus route may be altered slightly for the benefit and collection of some 13 children .</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education and Science where a young person under 18 years of age can be referred for residential psychological assessment .</P>
      <P>We have the most centralised education system in all OECD countries, according to a recent extensive OECD survey of education systems. The Minister referred to the Education (No. 1) Bill in a derogatory fashion and insulted the previous incumbent of his office by saying it was statist.  I assume he meant it was excessively centralised.  Today's Order Paper shows that our education system is centralised and that all power is vested in the Minister.  Slates are not put on roofs of schools without people trying to curry favour through petitions, deputations and Dáil questions.  If that is not statist and centralist, I do not know the true meaning of those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Deputy Hanafin said that nobody in Fine Gael or Democratic Left lamented the fact that regional education boards are no longer proposed.  I lament their passing.  During the debate on the earlier Bill I gave only qualified support to regional education boards because of the unsatisfactory relationship they would have had with the VEC structure.  I advocated then, as I do now, that the proper solution would be to abolish the vocational education committee system and to introduce a proper regional education system.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted from the Department's publication on key education statistics.  Some 25 to 30 vocational education committees administer 246 vocational schools in the second level sector. If that is not excessive bureaucracy, I do not know what is.  Surely the proper approach is to abolish the vocational education system which has served its useful purpose.  Prejudice still exists in my constituency <i>vis-a-vis</i> the services being delivered by vocational education committees.  It would be more appropriate to abolish vocational education committees and to establish fewer regional education boards which would be able to plan an integrated approach between primary, secondary and third level education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin also said there was no proper system of liaison between the different education facilities.  It is ironic that the Minister proposes to allow 25 to 36 vocational education committees to continue to administer 246 vocational schools, yet he will not introduce a system of regional administration for the 3,500 primary schools and 768 second level schools.  That is why this Bill is flawed.</P>
    <P>The Education (No. 1) Bill proposed two tiers of bureaucracy.  The ideal solution is to abolish the vocational education committees, which are regional education boards under another name, because they only administer education in one sector.  Westmeath VEC, which has been in the news recently, has a bureaucracy which administers five schools.  I understand that Laois VEC administers even fewer second level schools.  vocational education committees are involved in adult education and post-leaving certificate courses but this only happens in a limited number of schools for which they are responsible.  The best way to proceed is to amalgamate the vocational education committees with regional education boards and to reduce their number.</P>
    <P>The Minister has hung his hat on the claim that it would cost £40 million.  What does it cost to administer 250 schools under the VEC structure?  The Minister said he proposed to facilitate the type of dialogue that regional education boards would have provided by establishing county educational fora.  Are there any estimates of what that will cost?  Will it be a talking shop?  Is it not the case that the Minister is seeking to copperfasten powers he already has rather than trying to make the education system more open and inclusive?  The decision not to proceed with regional education boards is flawed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> During his speech the Minister mentioned boards of management.  I accept this is a complex legal and constitutional issue.  If the Education (No. 1) Bill erred on the side of throwing caution to the wind by making it obligatory to have boards of management, this Bill is a cop out.  Not alone does it remove the necessity to have boards of management in certain schools, but it leaves the door open to all schools to decide not to have such boards.  Far from achieving the objective of a participatory education system, it could close the door if patrons decide not to have boards of management as envisaged under the Bill.  There are difficulties.  Approximately 25 private schools are currently receiving public funds.  If the previous Minister erred in throwing caution to the wind, this Minister has erred on the side of abandoning all efforts to make these schools accountable.  There is a real danger that other schools may decide to opt out of their obligations with regard to the provision of boards of management.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the provision of educational facilities for children with special needs.  In dealing with this issue the Minister said: &ldquo;Section 7 [of the Bill] outlines that the Minister will have to ensure that there is made available to each person an appropriate level and quality of education&rdquo;.  It is my understanding that section 7 in no way achieves that objective.  Section 7 states that it shall be a function of the Minister under this Act &ldquo;to provide funding to each recognised school and centre for education and to provide support services to recognised schools, centres for education, students, including students with special educational needs, and their parents, as the Minister considers appropriate and in accordance with this Act;&rdquo;.  The section also states that in carrying out his or her functions the Minister shall have regard to the resources available.  This Bill seems to be taking one step forward and one step back.</P>
    <P>There are no guarantees with regard to the provision of facilities for children with special educational needs.  In this context let me refer briefly to the report published recently by the School Transport Review Committee which contains recommendations with regard to provision of school transport for children with special needs. This report highlights the minimalist and inadequate nature of the service, even to those children to whom the service is provided.  The report recommends &mdash; I wholeheartedly agree with its recommendations &mdash; that greater resources be devoted to the provision of home pick-up in an increased number of cases.  It further recommends that no pupil should be picked up earlier than 8 a.m. or returned home later than 4 p.m. approximately.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to recommend that, once current tests have been evaluated, a significant number of buses should be adapted to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs; that harnesses should be provided for all passengers needing them; that escorts should be provided on most <Col N="1328" /> services to special schools; that the level of medical grants should be reviewed at intervals no greater than three years; and that continuous efforts should be made to co-ordinate transport provided by the Department and health boards. That illustrates clearly that even where we are providing education for children with special needs, we are not providing it at locations adjacent to their homes, and the school transport service being provided is inadequate in a whole variety of areas.  None of those issues is addressed in a satisfactory manner in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 also deals to an extent with the provision of Irish language teaching in schools.  In my constituency I represent gaelscoileanna, what might be referred to as ordinary national schools, and primary schools in a Gaeltacht area.  There is discrimination against the schools in the Gaeltacht area in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio.  Primary schools in Gaeltacht areas are <i>de facto</i> gaelscoileanna; they are providing education through Irish.  They often labour under excessive difficulties that ordinary primary schools do not face in that teachers are obliged to run, side by side in the one classroom, education through Irish for children of the Gaeltacht and education for children of returned emigrants or children who have moved into the area from outlying areas and who may not be fluent in Irish.  It is time the Minister moved to end this discrimination against pupils and teachers in Gaeltacht primary schools.  There are great tensions in the national teaching profession about pupil-teacher ratios in gaelscoileanna as opposed to those in ordinary national schools, but there is good reason to address this anomaly at least and ensure that gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht national schools, which are <i>de facto</i> gaelscoileanna, have the same pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>I represent a largely rural constituency which has yet to see evidence of the existence of the Celtic tiger.  The lifeblood of the communities in large tracts of that constituency is being attracted to other areas where there are employment opportunities, and there is increasing demographic evidence of a structure of dependency in the local population with large numbers of retired people and young children but few people in their productive years to drive the local economy. Alarm bells are sounding in many areas throughout rural Ireland because of some of the recommendations in the School Transport Review Committee report.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not take the opportunity presented to him today to nail on the head some of the threats in this report to pupils in rural areas.  I refer to recommendations such as that except where a family holds a medical card a contribution of £90 a year should be made for any eligible or concessionary primary school passenger carried under the school transport scheme, or that the contribution with respect to an eligible or catchment boundary passenger whose family holds a medical card should be £30 a year.  Such recommendations are a direct attack on the children of rural Ireland.  I would like the <Col N="1329" /> Minister when replying to avail of the opportunity to reject the contents of this report in so far as they propose to charge pupils who are availing of the school transport system in rural areas. Such charges sound the death knell of primary schools and ultimately of secondary schools throughout rural Ireland, and that would be a regrettable development.</P>
    <P>This Bill is most unsatisfactory.  For a Bill that has had such a long gestation period, which has seen such a remarkable and unprecedented level of consultation with the education partners, with parents, teachers' organisations and patrons, it has achieved very little.  Deputy Gilmore hit the nail on the head when he said that we are enshrining in legislation a snapshot of the here and now which virtually imprisons the education system and prevents it from developing in a desirable fashion in the future.  The most regrettable aspect of the Education (No. 2) Bill is its failure to embrace democracy as a fundamental principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Keaveney.  I welcome this timely Bill.  The old <i>ad hoc</i> system worked well but as we march into the next century it is important that we put the basic provisions governing education on a statutory basis.  The success of our graduates on the international stage is evident.  The return of many of them, with a broad base of knowledge, as the Celtic tiger roars on is very welcome. However, there are huge challenges facing us and legislation is no good unless the necessary resources are invested in education.  While some people have the resources to educate their children, we must ensure that adequate resources are directed towards areas of high unemployment, poor housing and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Globalisation has meant that the qualifications obtained in Irish colleges are recognised throughout the world and graduates can now obtain jobs in most countries.  This is a tribute to the people who have gone before us in this House and to the education system.  While the advances made in technology and science are evident, there are major problems at certain levels in society, particularly in areas of high unemployment.  I am very concerned that the gap between those who have and those who have not is widening not only in financial terms but also in terms of education and the resources invested in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent surveys point out that high unemployment leads to truancy, crime, delinquency and drug addiction.  This chain could be broken if the necessary resources were put in place to ensure people were detected at an early age.  There has been much debate about the pupil-teacher ratio, but I am concerned that we have taken our eye off the ball.  While it is reasonable to expect a teacher to teach a class of 30 pupils who have the same intellectual and academic ability, in some areas teachers may only be able to teach 12 or 15 pupils because of different levels of ability.  I urge the allocation of more funding for remedial <Col N="1330" /> teachers in areas of high unemployment and social exclusion.  I commend the Minister on his endeavours in this area.  The introduction of the Breaking the Cycle scheme has been a positive step in my constituency but much more could be done in this area.  The drop out level among students in areas of high unemployment and social exclusion is alarming.  During a recent visit to Brussels I was told that approximately 20 per cent of students in the EU leave school without any qualification and that of these more than 50 per cent have basic difficulties in learning the three Rs.  This is reflected in this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to patrons, parents, principals and teachers.  It is very important that the Bill has been brought forward on the basis of consensus as partnership in education is what it is all about. We do not want to return to the past when some teachers adopted a stern attitude and many pupils did not like school.  The Bill recognises the need for compromise and consensus throughout the system.  There has been much debate by the various interest groups.  It is very important that the education area is governed by legislation and that adequate resources are provided for its implementation.</P>
    <P>Many primary school teachers can identify which students will be in jail by the time they are 18 years.  In most cases they are correct.  The necessary resources must be allocated for psychiatric assessment and remedial teaching so that these pupils can be given extra assistance. Teachers are crying out for this assistance.  Many of them have told me it is possible to teach a class of 30 pupils if they are all at the same level but that if there is one disruptive pupil it is very difficult as one is effectively teaching two classes, a class of 29 who are performing well and one pupil who is progressively falling behind.</P>
    <P>Most schools have computers but unfortunately full use cannot be made of them as schools close too early.  Schools should be regarded as institutions of learning within communities.  In areas of high unemployment and social exclusion parents should be able to attend schools during the evening so that they can become involved and interested in and understand the education system.  Parents who dropped out of the education system at an early age have low self-esteem and do not have the ability to apply for a job.  Some people who visit my clinic ask me to write their CV for them. Many of them have five or six children and do not have the opportunity to avail of further education which would provide them with the opportunity to obtain a decent job.</P>
    <P>Schools should be made centres of learning which are attractive to students, parents and the wider community.  There is nothing more depressing than to see a school locked and unused during a fine summer's evening.  While advances have been made in the area of adult education, there is a fundamental need to bring everyone within the one unit so that partnership and interest can be developed within communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> In recent decades much lip service has been paid to people with special needs.  It is recognised that these people have a right to an education and to attend the school of their choice.  However, the necessary resources have not been provided for this purpose.  The basic provision of access for wheelchair users is still far behind what is required, while people with special needs find it difficult to get to school because of a lack of proper transport.  This is very regrettable.  While it has been acknowledged that the right place for people with special needs is within the school and the community, much more needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>If 20 per cent of students in the EU leave school with no qualifications then it is possible that 20 per cent of Irish students do the same. While students with the ability, interest and desire to further their education have benefited from the advances in this area, many students find school unattractive and drop out at an early age.  Even though many of these students may be given support at home, the system may not suit them.  We must make the curriculum more flexible and recognise that all students do not mature at the same age.  Many of the 35 and 40 year old people attending adult education classes could not apply themselves to learning when they were 15 and 16 years.  The Minister has acknowledged that the blunt instrument of the examination system can make many students afraid of failure and rather than do this they drop out of school.  We must look at the point system and the huge pressure this puts on people, particularly low achievers.  The blunt examination system is forcing out of the system the students we most need to keep in it.</P>
    <P>When I left school I could speak Irish. However, as I have had no opportunity to use it in the meantime I have lost the confidence to speak it.  It is desirable that Irish would be more commonly spoken.  While there has been an increase in gaelscoileanna, people find that Irish is forced upon them as opposed to encouraging them to speak it. For that reason we have lost our national tongue, which is regrettable.  People of my age group who are still young enough to pick up on the basics we learned in national and second level schools should work on developing the Irish language.  If I speak Irish it gives the opportunity to another person to speak to me in Irish.  There is lack of encouragement of the mature population to use the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Central to this issue is the teacher.  In Ireland the teacher is held in high esteem and recognised as a person of standing.  Other European countries experience difficulties recruiting teachers because the profession is considered less important than other professions requiring degrees and it is not as attractive financially or socially.  The teacher is central to the education system and must be kept on a pedestal in the community.  The policies the Government is pursuing <Col N="1332" /> will allow the teacher to have a say in teaching methods, which provides for diversity in the education system.  The status of the teacher within the education system and the community must not be undermined.</P>
    <P>As regards patrons, it is important that parents and pupils are given a choice.  As we move into a multi-denominational, multi-cultural society it is imperative that patrons are not removed from the education process.  I welcome the provision in that regard.  Everybody has a right to decide what is best for their children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very innovative.  I welcome the refreshing impetus he has put into the education system as we face the millennium.  Just because he comes from Cork does not mean I will not be seeking extra provisions from time to time. Resources must be put into national schools as many students drop out of the education system at that stage.  There is not enough psychiatric assessment in schools.  In the event of a child becoming obstructive in the classroom there is little the teacher can do except put him or her outside the door.  That problem is not being addressed.  Reports suggest a direct link between delinquency, juvenile crime, long-term unemployment and a criminal record with lack of education.  It is imperative this Bill is backed up with resources in the areas mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin suggested there is no association between geographical location, truancy, delinquency and crime and the lack of educational achievement.  That may be true, but in certain parts of the country there are problems which are obvious to people outside the community but not to those within it.  People in those areas consider it normal for pupils to drop out of school at 14 years of age and for young people not to be able to read and write.  Many parents in those areas are long-term unemployed and have low self-esteem, as have their children.  Because resources have not been made available, teachers surrender to those circumstances.  The breaking the cycle scheme should be extended because it has the potential to address such problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed said that every day there are questions on the Order Paper to the Minister about planning permission for new schools, school extensions and changes in bus routes.  It would be difficult to change that system.  At the end of the day there is accountability to this House.  Deputies have an opportunity to ask questions of the Minister about problems in their constituencies and the Minister has ultimate responsibility in that regard.  I would be very slow to change that system.  In the recent past many of our institutions have become unaccountable.  I would be concerned about any change that would give ultimate accountability to unelected people. The Minister for Education and Science has a very important role in ensuring education is properly provided and funded.</P>
    <P>Having studied in depth the Bill and the Minister's speech, I look forward to the next millennium because the Minister has deep knowledge <Col N="1333" /> of what it required for the future.  While the Celtic tiger roars and our graduates make great achievements at national level, there are others who fall far behind.</P>
    <P>The proposal on regional education boards, when first mooted, received much attention from the public and the teaching profession.  It would have cost £40 million to set up that system, which would not have been as effective as we were led to believe.  The present system works reasonably well.  All that is needed is the legislative framework to back it up and allow for consultation within the education system.  The bringing together of various bodies will result in greater accountability and give greater feedback to those who make the decisions.</P>
    <P>If regional education boards were set up as originally proposed, many problems would have arisen.  For example, it would have resulted in centralisation.  The Minister would have greater influence over the direction the education system would take.  At present there is an independent system which allows for diversity of teaching, views and cultures.  I welcome the Minister's courageous decision to abandon the proposal to set up regional education boards.  The sum of £40 million is a substantial amount and in the light of the problems which I have outlined, the lack of remedial teachers and access to national and second level schools for people with disabilities, it will go a long way towards solving those issues which are huge obstacles to individuals trying to get into the educational process.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and compliment the Minister on it.  I look forward to the debate on subsequent stages and its successful implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the first time I have had an opportunity to formally congratulate the Minister on his appointment and, as a fellow Cork man with east Cork connections, I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I also take this opportunity to thank the Minister for the action he took earlier this week in deciding to grant aid a gaelscoil in Cobh.  It has led to great joy in Cobh.  He is aware of the conditions under which children and teachers there were working.  I know he went through an exhaustive process of examining the needs and the provision of schools in Cobh.  It is a welcome step and I thank him for it on behalf of the people of the area.</P>
      <P>When I look at an education Bill I try to figure out the philosophy behind it.  In the 1960s we were concerned about access and later we became concerned about participation.  The Minister mentioned both among the objectives of the Bill, which I welcome, but we must go further. The Minister has attempted to go further by mentioning something new.  He said that we must promote the means whereby students may benefit from education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister said he would look for constructive points in regard to the Bill.  Most speakers have alluded to disadvantage <Col N="1334" /> in education, and maybe the Minister should insert in the Bill a provision to compensate those suffering disadvantage.  This is the one thing which remains to be done.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s people could not see beyond access.  They felt that everybody would be satisfied if they could solve that problem, but that did not solve it.  In the 1970s and 1980s it was participation, but that still did not solve the problem. We must go beyond these issues.  We must make that an important provision in the philosophy underpinning this Bill and everything we do from now on, and we must insert that in the Bill in some way.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources, but that is not very specific.  We must flesh that out because when one is putting it into law &mdash; it is the first time this is being done &mdash; I would like to see a little more detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about enhancing accountability and transparency in making decisions in the education system, yet he does not say how that will be done or what it means.</P>
    <P>In the earlier Bill the Minister inserted an amendment to include specially resourced centres for students with behavioural difficulties and special units for severely disruptive pupils but they are not included here.  I wonder why the Minister changed his mind.  Why did he not include his own suggestion regarding severely disruptive pupils in this Bill, because the Minister and I are aware that the one element which causes teachers, students and parents most stress is the disruptive student?  One disruptive student in a school of 800, 900 or 1,000 can upset the whole school because the teachers speak about the disruptive student in the classroom all the time, they do not know how to cope and they do not have the resources.  I do not see this addressed in the Bill either.  The Minister spoke about looking into the matter, but it is very serious.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains an appeals system where a student is suspended from a school.  For the first time there is provision for a board to permanently exclude a student from a school.  By making such a provision in the Bill, the Minister has acknowledged the right of a school to permanently exclude a student and, by definition, he has also implied that all other schools can refuse to enrol a student for reasons other than the unavailability of accommodation.  If that appeal is made, if it goes right up the line and everybody says the school, the principal and the board are right, what happens to the student?  Could the Minister look into making some provision in this Bill where such a student can be looked after?  We might be talking about a 15 year old, a 14 year old or a 12 year old.  Earlier this week there were reports in the media of children between the ages of seven and eight with whom the system cannot cope, and this is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about resources and seems to be preoccupied with their availability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> Throughout this Bill &mdash; not the other one &mdash; the provisions are qualified by the phrase &ldquo;where resources permit&rdquo;.  When we talk about issues like this, resources are not the primary consideration. When we talk about a child between the ages of eight and 12, who is disrupting a school and a family and with whom the system cannot cope, we need to find the resources.  However, resources should not be the primary concern, and I think the Minister would agree with me.</P>
    <P>It seems that the provisions for suspension and expulsion are very convoluted and could take a long time.  What happens in practice when a student causes a major problem?  It is not clear in the Bill whether the principal can suspend the student on the spot, and that might cause problems later.  The Minister has not made provision for it.  Has he given the school principal the power to suspend?  The board has the power, but does that mean it must meet to suspend a student?  Can it devolve the power to the principal?  This could cause problems at local level, especially if a parent decides to test it in court.  We could all be back here again next year to amend the Bill so it might be useful to look at that.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for &ldquo;a reasonable time from the date that the parent or student was informed of the decision&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  I suggest that an amendment is inserted to tighten up that provision.</P>
    <P>If something happened in a school, the board hears about it and a student is expelled or suspended, it goes up the line to the Secretary General of the Department.  If that is not centralisation, what is it?  That is very serious.  Students who are suspended or expelled from school often come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Asking their parents to interact with the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science is like asking them to interact with President Clinton.  They will not be able to do so.  Parents and children faced with this kind of problem often give up hope and do not try to interact with anyone because they are not be aware of the procedure whereby they can appeal.  I suggest that the Minister include a provision to allow parents of children in educationally disadvantaged areas to be advised by school authorities that they can appeal a decision if they wish.  They should also be given the support to do so.  I am sure the Minister will take this serious point on board.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the regional education boards might not work, might be very expensive to operate and might be overly bureaucratic.  In that context, however, I offer him the example of the vocational education committees which work extremely well.  The vocational education committees are currently doing a job which regional education authorities could do.  The vocational education committees in Cork city and county work extremely well and they have been successful and innovative.  If the Minister will pardon the pun, they are at the &ldquo;chalk front&rdquo;.  Will the Minister reconsider his position on this issue?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> The Minister referred to &ldquo;county fora&rdquo; but no one knows what the term means.  Is he referring to 26 or 28 different groups which will be mere talking shops?  Will these fora have powers or will they be able to provide support to schools?  The Minister referred to these fora but why did he not include them in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in respect of co-operation at local level, which is laudable.  It was one of the main planks designed to underpin the regional education boards.  In the context of local co-operation, let us consider an area in a town or city where three schools offer similar subjects and a number of students in each school wish to pursue physics at honours level.  If there was enough interest from students, it is possible that the three schools could put together one honours physics class.  However, if they work individually their resources will be stretched.  Will the Minister put in place a provision to encourage schools to co-operate with each other in areas of the kind to which I refer?  If they could, it would be of benefit to students who are our main concern.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with schools which were unable to offer students various subjects at leaving certificate level because only a small number of students wished to avail of those subjects.  Other schools in the same area encountered similar problems.  The regional education boards could have played a role in this regard because this is a local issue, of which the Department of Education and Science's advisers and inspectors might not be aware.  It is crucial that the Minister give consideration to this matter.  Co-operation between schools would also mean that music and other subjects, which are currently unpopular for the reasons outlined, could be offered by schools.</P>
    <P>While we are discussing local co-operation, there is no reference to the home-school community liaison programme in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for its inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has recognised many things in the Bill so why can he not recognise that scheme?  The home-school community liaison programme has been extremely successful and it should be expanded to include all schools as soon as possible.  I agree with Deputy Kelleher that disadvantage is not confined to certain schools or areas.  There are disadvantaged students in every school and there are different types of disadvantage.  The home-school community liaison programme would also provide the link between primary and secondary schools to which Deputy Hanafin referred.  There are areas where students leave primary school and do not enrol in secondary school but there is no mechanism to track them.  Perhaps the Minister will take note of that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that boards of management will be established where practicable.  That leaves an opt out clause for patrons and others who, if they do not agree with boards of management, may place obstacles in the way of their establishment. <Col N="1337" /> I suggest that the Minister strengthen the provision.  I agree there may be isolated cases where boards of management cannot be established but I cannot recall one.  In a democracy, it is important that boards of management be established in all schools.  As it stands, the provision leaves an opt out clause which could benefit idiosyncratic people who do not like boards of management.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no reference to gender balance in respect of boards of management.  Perhaps the boards will be made up of all-male or all-female personnel.  If nothing else, it would be useful to include a provision on gender balance as an aspiration which has been omitted since the publication of the previous Education Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  The great changes in education came about as a result of my party's publication of the Just Society document in the 1960s which proved to be a major catalyst for change. One Minister for Education in the 1950s referred to himself as a &ldquo;dungaree man&rdquo;.  Deputy Hanafin reminded us that he stated &ldquo;You have your teachers and you have your schools but I am just the dungaree man hitting the knocks out of the pipes&rdquo;.  The Minister's colleague today christened him the &ldquo;silicon man&rdquo;.  I hope that was intended as a compliment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>As am I, because it has many implications.  As the silicon man, I hope the Minister will not be like the dungaree man who did little to change the system.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Bill is too centralised and provides for too much control by the Minister.  I hope he will not become the super computer chip in the Department of Education and Science exercising control over everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been constructive.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to promoting the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students.  We have been sitting in the House for the past 90 minutes and we have had no physical exercise.  Is that the reason for his failure to allude to physical development in the Bill?  Students are becoming fat, lazy and unhealthy.  Why does the Bill fail to mention physical development?  Has the Minister gone soft?  I hope I do not become soft.  The Minister should include a provision on the physical development of students.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 49 and 52 on 23 October 1997 and to Question No. 287 on 16 December 1997.  As I indicated, my Department has been following international developments, particularly in Europe, relating to the introduction of terrestrial and satellite digital broadcasting with particular reference to the implications of its introduction for Irish broadcasters and viewers. There continues to be conflicting international opinions regarding the relative merits of terrestrial or satellite digital broadcasting and the implications and impact of the introduction of either form of digital broadcasting in Ireland and in other countries is far from clear.  It is also unclear as to the extent to which the introduction of either technology will increase the choice available to viewers in terms of completely new television channels.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are complex.  As I have already informed the House, I have received a submission from RTE which puts forward for consideration a possible strategy for the provision of digital terrestrial television in Ireland. The capital cost of the provision of the necessary transmission infrastructure and for viewers in terms of acquiring the necessary receiving equipment either in the form of new digital television receivers or of set-top converters in respect of existing receivers will be significant. The issue of the date for cessation of the existing analogue transmissions on the provision of digital transmissions will also have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I recently discussed the submission with the RTE Authority and its submission will inform my thinking, in consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, who has certain responsibilities in the matter.  I intend to develop and put policy proposals to Government on digital broadcasting for consideration as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has added to the conflicting signals from her Department.  <i>The Irish Times</i> carried a report this week that cable television viewers and MMDS consumers will have access to up to 450 channels on digital television by the end of the year.  The implication is that the Minister has given authorisation and consent for this to happen.  Given that digital television will become a reality in Britain by Autumn, should she now have a clear focus on what she wants to do, along with her ministerial colleague, and have a timetable in place to have her plans implemented?  What is her response to the RTE submission?  Should the authority be involved in the provision of digital services and does she favour its proposal for the acquisition of a strategic partner to finance them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion on the matter seems to lie with Deputies opposite because any one who has been involved in examining digital television will understand its complexity as digital broadcasting technology can be applied to satellite, cable and MMDS technology as well as terrestrial broadcasting.  It is not just a simple off the cuff choice as these issues are extremely important.</P>
      <P>We know of their urgency and underlined that when we had the opportunity to have a very fruitful discussion with the RTE Authority about having them looked at immediately.  It is important to realise that while there is an urgency to develop a policy relating to digital broadcasting, a note of realism should be maintained.</P>
      <P>A number of doubts have been expressed with regard to BSkyB, for example.  Recent media reports suggest that the already delayed launch planned for Spring 1998 may be further delayed and there is a question as to whether proposals that have been put forward in other jurisdictions will lead to a greater choice in channels for viewers.  The issues must be looked at in detail and firm decisions reached.  I intend to put a policy on digital broadcasting before Government by mid-year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered either of my questions.  The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> states that cable television and MMDS suppliers will have access to digital services by the end of the year.  That implies the Minister has given authorisation for that to happen.  She did not respond on the report she received from RTE.  Has she formed an opinion as to whether it should be involved in the provision of digital services?  Does she favour its proposal on the acquisition of a strategic partner to raise the money to provide them?  Given the urgency of the matter and that digital services will become a reality in Britain by autumn, should she concentrate a great deal of her attention on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the urgency of the matter and that is why I took the opportunity to meet the RTE Authority to discuss it and others pertaining to broadcasting.  I have received the RTE submission and it is being considered.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that I do not wish to expound Fianna Fáil policy on the matter until I have an opportunity to put it to the party and the Government.  When that happens in mid-year, the policies will become known and there will be an opportunity to discuss them in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise the issues with which we must concern ourselves, for example, the provision of the necessary infrastructure.  The Deputy referred in particular to transmission and the RTE proposal in that regard.  However, it is only one proposal and a number of other issues must be considered.  We must also examine the interests of viewers and listeners.  It is interesting to note, particularly with regard to BSkyB, that it has been reported that the number of new channels <Col N="1340" /> which will be on offer initially will also be very limited and it was quoted as saying that only one new channel was definitely due to launch, which was to be called a Manchester United channel.  We must keep perspective and make sure the road we take is the right one.</P>
    <P>The interests of programme and film makers must be considered as well as the provision of new services and the optimising of opportunities to provide specialist services, including education, for those suffering from sensory deprivation in local and community services.  I hope these opportunities will come on stream in the proposed digital system.  Special attention must also be paid to the commercial exploitation of increased capacity.  These matters must be taken with great seriousness.  It is not a question of prevarication on the issue but one of looking at all options and coming to a firm decision.  I propose to do so in mid-year following discussions with the Government and it can then be discussed with Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <P>The first supplementary relates to my legislative programme which is the subject of Question No. 2 and the Deputy will have an opportunity to ask supplementary questions when we get to it.</P>
      <P>We have been waiting more than four and a half years for legislation on broadcasting.  The former Minister published an interesting and erudite paper called Clear Focus.  Its proposals, however, were based on the analogue rather than the digital system.  Things have moved on considerably since then.  I want to harness all new information, particularly on technology.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the position in regard to technology.  Our experiences with other international broadcasters have changed considerably in the past year and a half.</P>

      <P>The timetable for legislation in areas within my remit is as set out in the Government's legislative programme, published on 23 January.  I am aware the Deputy recently expressed concerns in the House in relation to promised legislation on broadcasting and wildlife, <Col N="1341" /> in particular, and I would like to set out clearly the position in both cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to broadcasting, in light of my consideration of the issues involved &mdash; which have become much more complex than those that obtained when the Deputy was in office and, who, after four and a half years in Government, failed to introduce his long promised major broadcasting legislation &mdash; I am working on the basis that it will be necessary to bring forward two Bills on broadcasting.  One Bill will have the primary objective of transposing into law article 3A of Directive 97/36/EC, which is designed to ensure continued access for viewers to coverage on free-to-air television of events of major importance to society.  The second Bill will be a more comprehensive broadcasting Bill dealing with other critical issues such as the introduction of digital broadcasting, the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity and measures to support the local radio sector.  I hope to be able to submit my proposals for both Bills to Government later this year.</P>
      <P>While a draft of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill was close to finalisation before the Deputy left office, it was not a final draft.  A number of technical issues which had been raised by the parliamentary draftsman's office remained to be resolved.  The sections of the Bill relating to the designation of natural heritage areas needed to be revisited, particularly in the context of the level of protection proposed in the draft legislation.  In addition, certain sections of the Bill required examination and revision in the light of experience gained from the process of preparing the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  A working group in my Department has been working to finalise these outstanding issues with a view to having an updated draft ready for the parliamentary draftsman's office next month.  It should be noted that some of the issues involved will have to be agreed in consultation with other Departments.</P>
      <P>I have availed of the opportunity to consult with a number of interested parties in regard to the Bill.  The purpose of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is not to legalise EU directives, as stated by the Deputy in this House on 28 January last.  The relevant EU directives &mdash; the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive &mdash; are already transposed into Irish law, principally by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, which were signed by the Deputy, as the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in February of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's clarification and assurance that the regulations I signed are still in place.  The commitment given by members of her party in different parts of the country would lead one to suspect that matters had changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that as Minister I published a Green Paper and what should be called heads of legislation, fócas géar.  It is somewhat disingenuous to <Col N="1342" /> suggest that digitalisation arose as an issue between June l997 and today.  If the broadcasting authority had been established under the heads of the legislation as published, it would have been able to advise on digitalisation and there would be no need to delay the introduction of the broadcasting legislation while considering digitalisation.  Article 3A is short and should not have to await the introduction of the broadcasting Bill. When the Minister was in Opposition she and her colleague frequently reminded me that it should not be necessary to wait for the publication of the broadcasting Bill to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge on an autonomous basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some misunderstanding in all of this.  Article 3A of the directive refers to the coverage of sporting events etc on free-to-air television.  The Deputy will recall that when I was in Opposition and he was Minister, he took on board my proposals for a Bill I published on behalf of Fianna Fáil providing for free-to-air television to ensure continued access to cultural events, particularly sporting events.  That will be a separate Bill.  The directive can be examined in the light of the Bill I am putting forward.  It will need legislation, but it will not have to wait until the broadcasting Bill is published.  I intend to publish it before that Bill.</P>
      <P>Matters concerning Teilifís na Gaeilge will be considered under the broadcasting Bill, but they can be dealt with separately if they are ready before that Bill is published.  As a former Minister, I am sure the Deputy understands this depends on the availability of staff in the parliamentary draftsman's office and the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the number of departmental staff who deal with these issues has been increased to enable the Minister to introduce some of this legislation in l998.  Seven Bills were promised in the Government's programme.  What is the position regarding legislation on architectural heritage and public parks?  I do not understand why the Wildlife Bill needs to be amended in respect of NHAs.  What was laid down in terms of necessary protection was known at the time the text was drafted, which was available to the Minister on assuming office.</P>

    <P>The legislation dealing with national parks and historical properties will not be published until next year.  The Bills dealing with the national inventory of architectural heritage, wildlife, television <Col N="1343" /> coverage of major sporting events and broadcasting are currently a priority.</P>

Gheall sé go ndéanfadh sé cinneadh go luath tar éis dó a bheith thíos ann &mdash; thug sé cuairt, labhair sé le muintir an oileáin, tá an t-eolas go léir aige agus tá an freagra a thug sé dom inniu bunaithe ar an iarratas a chuir muintir Inis Bigil chuig an chomhairle contae.  Ní sin an cheist atá curtha síos agamsa don Aire Stáit.  Cén cinneadh atá déanta aige?  An bhfuil sé báúil leis an carr-chábla seo, an bhfuil slí isteach eile beartaithe agus cathain a dhéanfar cinneadh faoi sin?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú beag a thabhairt don Teachta.  Ní fhéadfainn cinneadh a dhéanamh gan iarratas agus mar is eol don Teachta bhí sean-iarratas curtha isteach a mbeidh athnuachan le déanamh air i gcomhthéacs na gcostas a bhainfidh le hiarratas nua.  Freisin, beidh ar an dream a chuirfidh an t-iarratas isteach a rá an bhfuil na foinsí airgid a bhí measta acu ag an am sin le fáil don togra seo anois.  D'fhéadfadh impleachtaí costais a bheith ag baint le coinníollacha a ghabhfadh leis an iarratas pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag éirí as an gcuairt a thug mise ar Inis Bigil agus as cuairt a thug oifigeach de mo Roinnse ar an oileán le mí anuas, táimid réidh anois chun glacadh le hiarratas ón gcomharchumann ansin ar charr-chábla a chur isteach.  Nuair a gheofar an <Col N="1344" /> t-iarratas sin, déanfar é a mheas go scioptha. Caithfear na himpleachtaí airgid a bhainfidh leis a scrúdú agus mar sin beidh mé ag iarraidh meastachán athbhreithnithe ón gcomharchumann maidir le foinsí airgid.</P>
    <P>Idir an dá linn, tá roinnt mioncheisteanna curtha ag an Roinn ar Roinn na Mara.  Táimid ag súil le freagra uathu réasúnta luath agus cead pleanála a bheith ar fáil maraon le hiarratas nua ón gcomharchumann ar an gcarr-chábla, ní chuirfidh aon fhiosrúchán atá an Roinn ag déanamh ag an am gcéanna aon mhoill ar chinneadh a dhéanamh ar iarratas an chomharchumainn.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil an Teachta sásta go bhfuil gach dícheall á dhéanamh ag an dá thaobh, an comharchumann agus an Roinn i dteannta a chéile, chun an cheist seo a bhrú chun críche.

Thug an tAire Stáit seo geallúint do mhuintir Inis Bigil go poiblí go ndéanfadh sé cinneadh faoin gceist seo.  Is léir nach bhfuil sé báúil leis an gcarr-chábla agus cad chuige nach ndéarfadh sé é sin leis na daoine ach go dtabharfaidh sé airgead do shlí isteach eile don oileán?</P>

Cinneadh faoi cé mhéid de dheontas a thabharfar an cinneadh atá le déanamh.  Freisin, is dóigh go mbeidh lucht an chomharchumainn ag iarraidh deis a bheith acu dul tríd na meastacháin a cuireadh isteach cheana mar bhí foinsí airgid luaite iontu agus níl a fhios agam an bhfuil na foinsí airgid sin ar fáil fós.

Bhí mé ag breathnú ar fhéidearthachtaí éagsúla.  tá an obair sin tugtha beagnach chun crícha againn agus tá mé ag fanacht ar fhreagra amháin.  Is cosúil go mbeidh an t-eolas sin agamsa i bhfad sul a mbeidh an comharchumann réidh chun iarratas críochnúil a chur isteach faoinar féidir ceadú airgid a bhunú, Ag deireadh an lae, nach faoi sin atá sé?  Go gceadófar airgeadh sonrach chun ligint do thogra dul ar aghaidh seachas a rá go ginearálta go bhfuiltear i bhfábhar.

      <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh an oiread eolais agus is féidir a thabhairt don Teachta.  Nuair a measadh na costais cheana, iomlán de £700,000 a bhí i gceist nó trí cheathrú milliúin punt.  Ag an am sin, ní rabhthas ag lorg ach £300,000 ón Roinn mar bhí go leor foinsí airgid eile luaite, an pobal ina measc.

Táimid ag obair i bpáirtíocht le pobal an oileáin, táimid i dteangbháil leanúnach leo agus tuigeann siad an clár oibre.  Tá pobal an oileáin sásta leis an gcur chuige, mar a thuigim ó mo chuid oifigigh agus más amhlaidh ba chóir dúinn glacadh leis go bhfuil an cur chuige is fearr i bhfeidhm.</P>

      <P>A total of 39 projects were offered funding under the cultural development incentives scheme.  Of these 39 projects, work has been largely completed or is under way at present in respect of 13.  In relation to the remaining 26 projects and on the basis of the information available to me I believe that the construction phase of the majority will commence during 1998 to allow for their completion within the timeframe of the current Operational Programme for Tourism.  A small number of the projects approved for funding under the CDIS is causing serious concern <Col N="1346" /> to my Department, in particular with regard to the ability of the promoters of these projects to meet all of the conditions laid down under the scheme.  It would serve no useful purpose for me to name these projects here today but I assure the Deputy that I have impressed upon the promoters the urgent and absolute necessity that they comply with the conditions of the scheme to be certain of their development and completion within the timeframe of the current Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>

Will the Minister communicate with me in writing about the status of the two projects in Galway West, which I represent, included in the Operational Programme for Tourism?  In particular, will she indicate if the money allocated for the museum project is still available?  The question relates to substitute projects.  I appreciate that one should try to encourage those who have been offered grants to meet the criteria laid down.  My approach is to be as patient as one can.

      <P>I will supply the information the Deputy is seeking about the projects in his constituency by letter.  All the conditions laid down under the scheme must be complied with. There has been or will be no wavering on this matter.  Not alone will I consider projects on the reserve list, I will look in detail at all applications submitted under phase two.  Some of the letters issued were dated 25 June 1997, the day before the Government was formed.  It is only fair and equitable that the promoters of those projects should be given every opportunity to comply with the conditions laid down.  Should they fail to do so, all the proposals submitted will once again be in the melting pot for further discussion.  Following the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism and because of currency fluctuations, the amount available under the CDIS has been reduced by £1.3 million.  That has to be my priority before we consider allocating funds for extra projects.</P>

Is it the case that difficulties have been created because certain local authorities are unwilling to commit themselves to meeting future running costs which is one of the conditions laid down?  If so, it will be necessary to have discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure sponsors will not see their projects fall apart because of a change of mind or lack of commitment on the part of local authorities?</P>

      <P>The position with regard to the Burren, specifically the entry point at Mullaghmore, is that Clare County Council has deferred a decision on the question of material contravention of the county development plan until next May.  In the meantime I am engaged in a process of consultation with local groups and interests.  Discussions are ongoing with groups in Corofin and Kilfenora about the provision of facilities at these locations in the context of the Burren National Park and the Burren in general. A significant part of this process consists of dialogue regarding the nature, housing, management and funding of such facilities.  These are sensitive matters, involving negotiations in which the balance between State input and local enterprise has to be right.  Of necessity, this process will take time.  For this reason I do not accept there is a delay in the provision of these facilities.  That said, I am as anxious as the Deputy that matters should be brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to set up a consultative committee on the heritage of the Burren composed of representatives of local and national bodies to <Col N="1348" /> advise me, <i>inter alia</i>, on the matters to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the proposals to establish heritage committees in Kilfenora and Corofin on the dung heap?  The Burren has been studied by many groups.  There is no necessity for a further study.  Is the Minister prepared to ignore local people who have shown their goodwill to satisfy one or two members of her party in County Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help but be amused at the ferocity with which the Deputy put his question for the reason that he was Minister of State at this Department for two and a half years when nothing was done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported that application.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done during the past six months.  I have met a number of groups.  The groups in Kilfenora and Corofin have been contacted today about the proposals they have put forward to ascertain how the facilities in those areas can best be utilised and improved.  There is also a need for progress in Mullaghmore.  I hope that project, which is subject to the planning process, will commence as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the entry point at Mullaghmore, obviously we would like to see that in place in addition to improving the centres in Kilfenora and Corofin.  I have met all of the groups concerned and will meet the Burren Action Group tomorrow.  I met that group on a previous occasion, and a meeting had been set up for 21 November but it was cancelled at short notice by the group.  I am realistic enough to know the Deputy might like to make a political point, but the seriousness of this matter and the work that has been done is perhaps not recognised by him. <Col N="1349" /> The people involved want this matter cleared up as soon as possible because it has been going on for the past seven years.  I have been in office just over six months and I intend to do all I can to resolve what some people regard as an intractable problem.</P>

Question Time is to allow Members of this House elicit as much information as possible from Ministers.  Deputies should only ask questions, they should not make statements.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when the Chair was on this side of the House he was rather long winded in his questions.  I am well able to ask the Minister questions about this problem which she has prevaricated on for the past seven months. When will that prevarication stop?  When will the people in Corofin and Kilfenora be made aware of the Minister's proposals?  Why must another study be carried out?</P>

      <P>Despite all the bluster from the Deputy opposite, he seems to have missed the point.  The question of another study does not arise.  We want all the people in north Clare to have a say in how they see the management of the Burren proceeding in the future not just the management of visitor centres.  That takes in all the areas, with particular emphasis on agri-tourism.  It is not a question of finding another committee as another excuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was the Minister responsible, part of my initiative was to establish a consultation process.  I might agree with the Minister more than she might think.  The consultative group is not attempting to repeat the work of the working group upon which the planning application is based.  Where stands the legal case now?  The people of Kilfenora, Corofin and Ballyvaughan do not want to wait for the outcome of a legal consideration of a possible planning decision.  Can the Minister give some assurance to the three communities that the work on their proposals can proceed coterminously with the protracted consideration by Clare County Council of the proposal made to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first comment on his commitment and consultation is interesting because if one were to read statements made by him when in Opposition one would be given to understand that he was not interested in anything on the Mullaghmore site, or Gortlecka, as he would refer to it.  Yet he championed a very different proposal while he was in Government.  I agree with the Deputy's view on planning permission but that is a long way from the views he expressed in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the consultative process, this should not be seen as an opportunity to rehash all the old arguments.  There is a great deal of history involved in this whole issue which makes it difficult to address.  This body will not only <Col N="1351" /> examine the site at Mullaghmore but it will also have an opportunity to examine the long-term benefits for the Burren as a whole.  The Burren is not just a national park, it is a far greater area than that and, as responsible citizens, we must ensure it is preserved.  The best way that can be done is through consultation with concerned local and national bodies.</P>
    <P>The planning process is proceeding in the usual way, and I would like to see that process come to fruition.  The last time we debated this matter Deputy Higgins agreed with me that it is not our prerogative to interfere in the planning process, that it must be independent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal case, I understand there will be a hearing involving the Burren Action Group in the High Court on Monday.  The decision of the planning authority to delay its decision until May 1999 is part of the due process to which I consented.  It is a question of planning permission and it is outside my control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue and it will not cause any heated debate unless you interfere, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Why did the Minister and the Department consent to postponing the planning decision?  The Minister told Deputy Higgins she did not have any part in it, but she did.  She could have demanded that the planning decision be made but she did not.  Why did she agree to the postponement thereby conveying the impression to the people in Corofin, Kilfenora and Ballyvaughan that new visitor facilities will not be provided in those areas without the planning permission?</P>

      <P>That is the view Deputy Carey wants to put forward, but it is not an accurate or fair one.  I am not and never was a member of Clare County Council or any other county council.  I believe in the independence of county councils and the independence of the planning process.</P>

Freisin, tá bóithre <Col N="1354" /> nua ann a chaithfear caoi a chur orthu agus freisin, bhí an seanscéim ag dul siar i bhfad agus é deacair a rá cén uair a ba chóir líne a tharraingt agus a rá nach rabhamar ag glacadh le hiarratais níos sine ná sin.</P>
      <P>An rud ba éasca a rá leis an bpobal ná iarratas as an nua a chur isteach ach is ar dhá bhonn a scrúdófar na hiarratais sin.  Caithfidh siad titim taobh istigh de rialacha na scéime &mdash; caithfear nach bóithre atá faoi chúram na comhairle contae atá i gceist, mar shampla &mdash; agus ansin breathnófar ar an bhfuílleach agus iarrfar ar an gcomhairle contae meastachán a chur ar fáil do dheisiú na mbóithre sin.  Má tá meastachán réasúnta suas chun dáta ag an gcomhairle contae cheana féin níl le déanamh acu ach é sin a chur ar ais ag an Roinn.  Ach tá téarmaí na scéime athraithe agus ní mór a bheith soiléir faoi sin.</P>
      <P>Le go mbeadh an scéim oscailte agus féaráilte, leagamar síos coinníollacha daingne: is bóithre le 20 líon tí ag baint úsáide astu amháin atá i gceist le bóithre portaigh agus níltear sásta dul níos faide ná na tithe mar tá géarchéim ann maidir le bóithre ag tithe agus táimid ag iarraidh díriú ar an riachtanas sin i dtosach.</P>
      <P>An sprioc atá againn ag brath ar líon na n-iarratas an fhadhb seo maidir le cóiríocht na mbóthar chuig tithe sa nGaeltacht a réiteach go luath agus is air sin atá an scéim dírithe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na buntreoirlínte, cuireadh litir ag chuile Theachta Dála agus ag chuile Sheanadóir go bhfuil Gaeltacht ina gceantair nuair a fógraíodh an scéim le cóip den fhógra a chuaigh sna páipéir le go mbeidís ar an eolas ar an bpointe. Leag mé amach an próiseas a bheas i gceist ach tá fadhbanna áirithe ag baint le roghnú na mbóithre, mar shampla, caithfear an Ghaeilge a thógáil san áireamh ach má tá pleananna Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí leagtha beidh mé ag iarraidh cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt dóibh ionas go mbeidh an scéim roinnte go féaráilte go tíreolaíoch.  Is páirtíocht é idir an Roinn agus an pobal; más Gaeltacht <Col N="1355" /> iad caithfidh feidhm a bheith le pleanáil Ghaeilge sna ceantair sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le riachtanas, an sprioc atá leis seo ná bóithre chuig tithe.  Mar shampla, tabharfar tús áite go praiticiúil áit a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí le fada, is cuma cé chomh fada as baile.  Ach má théann daoine uaidh siar ag tógáil tí, níl an riachtanas sin chomh géar le teach a bhí ann le céad bliain roimhe sin agus go bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí ann an t-am ar fad agus iad ag feirmeoireacht.  Dá ndéarfainnse go ndéanfainn na bóithre is mó go bhfuil tithe orthu agus is giorra i dtosach, tá roinnt bóithre atá ag dul ag tithe atá i bhfad siar agus go bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí iontu le céad bliain nó breis a bhfágfaí ar lár go deireadh. Caithfimid díriú ar na bóithre sin de réir a chéile agus beimid ag tabhairt treorach do na stiúrthóirí liosta a réiteach taobh istigh de na treoirlínte a bheas bunaithe ar riachtanas agus láidreacht an cháis ó thaobh chaoi an bhóthair.  An bunsprioc atá agam ná go mbeadh fáil éasca ag chuile dhuine ar a teach agus ar a theach féin.</P>

      <Quest>if she has examined and decided details of the Boffin initiative in relation to environmental conservation and coastal protection; the funding, if any, available in 1998 for this purpose; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Boffin conservation initiative which I understand is being promoted by an island based voluntary group formed to conserve and preserve the dune system at Duach Beach situated at the island's east end.  I also understand that the Leader programme grant-aided the project in 1997 and that further Leader funding has been sanctioned to enable the project to continue in 1998.</P>
      <P>I should add that I sanctioned a grant of £40,000 to Galway County Council in 1997 to enable it to carry out some coastal protection works on the island.  These works are in addition to the conservation works being undertaken under the Boffin conservation initiative.</P>
      <P>The islands programme of allocations for 1998 is now being prepared and proposals for this programme are being examined by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there liaison between the Minister of State's Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government?  The question covers not only the east end project but the coastal erosion on Inisbofin.  What is the response to the recent application by Galway County Council for grant aid for essential coastal protection work at a very dangerous <Col N="1356" /> section where the road on Inisbofin is in danger of collapsing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>There is continuous dialogue between my Department and the various county councils.  I wrote during the week seeking to meet the various island committees of the councils involved.  I hope through this partnership to develop programmes to deal with coastal erosion and other infrastructural problems on the islands.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, work was done by Galway County Council on the preparation of a coastal management plan for Inisbofin.  That programme cost in excess of £1 million.  My Department does not have access to funds of that magnitude, even though they have increased considerably.  We hope to work out a continuous programme of coastal work based on urgency, requirement, need and benefit.  I hope we will be able to conclude works on coastal protection on the islands in the 1998 programme of works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which, added to Deputy Carey's generous donation, has meant that considerable works have taken place.  The county council's estimate of the cost of the required work is £1.25 million.  That is its estimate, not mine.  We are preparing a programme of works and I do not want to pre-empt county council discussions.  I asked the various county council committees to meet me.  It would be wrong to make any decisions prior to those meetings.  The least I owe the county councils' islands' committee, the Galway <Col N="1357" /> one of which Deputy McCormack is a member, is that I will listen to what they have to say before making the decision on this year's allocation.</P>
      <P>I realise that coastal protection works on islands is vital.  The funds available from other sources are limited and it is necessary to try to work out, in partnership with county councils, within the limited funding, a coastal protection plan which is based on necessity and cost benefit. The benefit should outweigh the cost because there is such a demand for money.</P>

He wants to know why this urgent need has not been met this year.  The Minister will be negotiating this three way partnership between his own Department, the Department of the Environment and Galway County Council until the end of the year and no work will be done.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the house that Deputy Carey is referring to and I accept the urgency of the work.  Other very urgent works needed to be done to protect the road to another house so that an elderly person could have access to their own home.  Unfortunately, coming up to the end of last year my funds were limited. However, I can assure the Deputy that in consultation with the county councils &mdash; and I did not mention the Department of the Environment &mdash; decisions will be made quickly and these factors will be taken into account.  As I said regarding the bóithre áise, it is now the beginning of February and we are in the process of drawing up a plan of work for the year.  It is correct for me to discuss this with the county councils and then a full work programme will be announced.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be no good, next July, looking for £300,000 or £400,000 in the kitty that has not been allocated because, unlike last year, it will not be there.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to establish heritage councils in each county as suggested by the Deputy in his question, nor have I funds at my disposal from which I could allocate scholarships of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, the Heritage Council, an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, has broad functions in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the national heritage, and may provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to matters pertaining to its functions.  The council recently advertised a local community-based heritage grants scheme.  Decisions relating to the allocation of funds under this or any other scheme by the Heritage Council are solely a matter for the council itself in accordance with the terms of the Heritage Act, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the tenor of the Minister's reply.  With all due respect, does the Minister not think that heritage, local history and folklore should be dealt with on a local basis?  The Minister spoke about the national Heritage Council, but why can she not relate local heritage to local people who really matter?  Does the Minister realise that the Heritage Council means nothing to ordinary people?  Each day some elderly person dies in a parish it means part of the history of that locality disappears and nothing is being done to stop that loss. Back in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s there was a Folklore Commission, but we do not seem to be utilising the work that commission gathered and we are making no attempt to add to it.  Can the <Col N="1359" /> Minister do something to arrest that neglect?  We are losing part of our heritage every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept what the Deputy said about the importance of local heritage and culture.  Local people should be given every encouragement to try to protect their heritage and culture.  I mentioned the Heritage Council because it is a means of trying to assist local communities, not dictating to them.  Although it is a national body, the Heritage Council is in a position, through grant aid, to help some local heritage projects by way of the community-based grant scheme.  I mentioned that to be helpful to the Deputy and in order to pass on this information if the local people are not already aware of it.  As an independent body under the Act, the National Heritage Council will take decisions of its own volition.</P>
      <P>My Department has commenced work on a national heritage plan.  An important element is that local bodies with specific interests in heritage and culture will have a direct input into the plan. The national plan will, in effect, mirror the views of those within local areas.  The issue of recording local history and folklore could be addressed in the context of preparing local heritage plans.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that when I was in Opposition, my policy document proposed such local heritage plans.  This would be an opportunity to do so in conjunction with the national heritage plan.  The Heritage Council has its own national heritage plan, but my Department is commencing its own one.</P>
      <P>I would welcome the Deputy's views and initiatives in this regard.  We may be able to discuss this matter at a later stage to see what views the Deputy has.</P>

The Heritage Council may be all very fine &mdash; I have appealed to it previously for assistance for certain projects &mdash; but it does not relate to local issues.  I would appreciate if the Minister would take into account the importance of local input in counties and parishes.</P>

Will the Minister consider the transfer of such material to local county libraries for historical research and reference purposes?  Will the Minister request the Valuation Commissioners to issue instructions that no records in their possessions are to be destroyed?  What arrangements are being made by the National Archives to notify other archive repositories, such as county libraries, of the availability of records from Government Departments when the National Archives, having examined the records, have no interest in them?</P>

      <P>It is for you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to rule on this matter, but they are separate questions.  I would be happy to answer them if the Deputy would table specific questions on the National Archives and libraries.  I am well aware of the tremendous work by the National Archives in preserving and conserving our heritage.  That is why I was happy to allocate £13 million for National Archives capital projects at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The library system is a different matter which comes under the Department of the Environment because it comes directly under the aegis of local authorities.  It does not come under my Department's responsibility.  However, if the Deputy wishes to table specific questions about the National Archives I will do my utmost to answer them.</P>

For example, a number of long-term loans, some of them substantial, have been made and are continuing in respect of museums in many counties including Cavan, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Offaly, Tipperary and Wicklow.  All the museums in question have met the National Museum's criteria for sustaining <Col N="1361" /> material on long-term loan.  In addition, Waterford Heritage Museum was recently advised on the proposed conservation of historic items of clothing associated with Thomas Francis Meagher.  Correspondence was also entered into with the Waterford county manager concerning the exhibition, storage and conservation needs of a large and important body of archaeological material excavated in the city over recent years.</P>
    <P>Professional and curatorial assistance and advice is regularly given to a large number of local museums, including consultation concerning archaeological discoveries in their areas.  These include county museums in Cavan, Kerry, Cork, Limerick, Monaghan and a heritage centre in Laois.  As part of the general educational function of the National Museum of Ireland, staff regularly give lectures to local archaeological and historical societies, university seminars and school groups and conferences.</P>

      <P>It is important that short and long-term loans of museum artefacts are made available to local museums.  The National Museum of Ireland gives professional advice and assistance to local museums, particularly in the area of education.  It may help the Deputy to know that the recently enacted National Cultural Institutions Act provides for a form of designation for a museum under the aegis of a local authority where new discoveries of archaeological objects which are predominantly more of a local than a national interest might be held.  If he wishes to contact the Department, we will be able to give him more information on that.  The negotiation and loans of artefacts from the National Museum of Ireland follow strict criteria. However, as many museums have been able to fulfil these criteria, it is important that they are there for the general conservation, display and security of the artefacts involved.  I accept and applaud the principle of local museums being able to display artefacts particularly pertaining to their own areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  While we all realise that our education system is one of the finest, it would be dangerous to become complacent about it.  We must not take what we have for granted and we must take cognisance of current difficulties in education.</P>
      <P>There was much talk today about success in education.  We must commend well educated Irish people who have good jobs throughout the world. However, there is a big gap between those who have succeeded and those who have been deemed by our education system not to have succeeded. We must look not only at our high fliers but at the difference between the top achievers and those at the bottom level.  The way forward is to look at the changes taking place around us as we move into the new millennium and to create a structure that can respond effectively and efficiently to those changes.  That is what the Bill is trying to do.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that our education system derives from the early 1830s and that comprehensive legislation has not been passed by the Oireachtas. There has been significant consultation, debate and review during the drafting of this Bill.  I commend the Minister for Education and Science for introducing it.  It was said during the debate that the Bill was flawed despite the process of consultation and debate.  I reject that suggestion and look forward to discussing it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the highly trained and professional body which is our teaching profession. The key focus in any Education Bill must be the student.  As a former teacher, I recognise that the key objective is to provide a legislative basis for the respective roles and functions of all the partners in the education system.  Everyone is a partner under this Bill because of the process of consultation.  The partners in education have visibly expanded throughout the years with the role of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> Government, school owners, parents, teachers and pupils developing in the common good.  The Bill aspires to overcome any sense of administration by an elite few and formally acknowledges the role of all the partners.</P>
    <P>Teachers acknowledge that the increasing involvement of parents in their child's schooling must be welcomed.  Parents are the primary educators.  Teachers rely on parental involvement and their good exploitation of early education at home.  While their role in the home is important, their support and interest in the school is vital for the mutual advancement of everyone.</P>
    <P>There was a wide-ranging debate on the concept of the regional education boards which I am glad is not being pursued in this Bill.  Some argued against such a structure which they felt would make the education system more localised. However, few people were able to put real figures on the establishment and running costs.  Costs in providing carpeting, furnishing, heating and lighting buildings could not be justified at a time when so much is needed in the classroom.  Estimated costs of £40 million a year to run these institutions would have been far from insignificant in terms of the overall education budget.  Many schools in Donegal North East are crying out for extensions, modernisation and new facilities. Their record in providing remedial services is atrocious.  It would be better if the Minister used such expenditure in the classroom.</P>
    <P>The concept of regional education boards meant the Minister made all the decisions so it was not true devolution.  Questions were asked during this debate if this Bill or the previous one meant more centralisation.  If we devolve power to regional boards, not only will we set up ivory towers which will cost £40 million, but we will ensure that all decisions must be made by the Minister.  Perception and reality are not the same, and devolution to the regions was not what it was perceived to be because the Minister had the final say.  Deputy Kelleher's summing up was interesting.  It was originally proposed that local communities would be accountable, but local representatives should always be held accountable because they can be subjected to the ultimate sanction the next time they go before the public.</P>
    <P>I make a personal appeal to the Minister at this stage to look more closely at the provision of special education in Donegal.  I have raised the subject on numerous occasions in the past. According to the statistics, 78 per cent of people have access to a remedial teacher, but the fact that 104 schools out of 178 do not have a remedial teacher speaks for itself.  There were no remedial teachers in Donegal two years ago, and one was appointed last year.  I trust that the poor response in the past to the need for this facility in our region will be redressed in the near future.  I would like the Minister to specifically address my constituency and I make no apology for being parochial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> It is also desirable, where possible, to integrate pupils with special needs into mainstream schools.  I congratulate the Minister on the implementation of a pilot scheme in Buncrana.  The school in Buncrana was an ordinary national school, but the people concerned took the initiative of starting a special class for moderately handicapped children and, as well as a teacher, there was a classroom assistant.  Subsequently, they got approval to start a class for profoundly handicapped children, on a pilot basis, which was to go ahead in September.  Unfortunately they were informed this time last year that when their class for profoundly handicapped children was up and running, they would lose the classroom assistant assigned to the class for moderately handicapped children.  In August the Minister came to the rescue and gave approval for the appointment of another classroom assistant, thus enabling the school to have one assistant in each class.  Let me be so bold as to ask the Minister to consider approving the appointment of a second classroom assistant for the profoundly handicapped class &mdash; I believe there are institutions in Cork that have that facility.  Much work is being done towards integrating pupils with a handicap into mainstream schools.  That is the way forward, but resources are needed to achieve it.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for people in rural areas who have a child with a specific need to gain access to suitable facilities and to get transport.  I congratulate Scoil Íosagán which has developed two classes to cater for different degrees of handicap. However, the Minister's task is enormous because there is such a range of special needs and it is so difficult to bring people from varying distances and provide a suitable facility for them.</P>
    <P>Similarly I acknowledge the Minister's positive attitude to pupils with special needs.  However, I would refer him to any primary teacher training handbook which emphasises the importance of music in the early development of a child's language, rhythm and co-ordination.  The Minister should seriously address the provision of music in the classroom, not merely as a subject but as a mechanism for dealing with special needs at an early stage of development.  This would bear fruit in the long-term, not just for individual children but for the teachers and the class in general.  I do not think I am oversimplifying matters when I say that if a child with a special need is recognised early enough, he or she can be helped through music which, because of its effects on language development and co-ordination, means that the child will be happier, first for having knowledge of the subject and second because he or she is able to keep up a little better.  If the child is happier, the class, the teacher and the parents are happier and the whole thing spirals in a positive direction.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill will put in place an effective appeals system.  In the vast majority of cases there is little controversy between student and teacher or parent and school.  However, it is important that where parents or students feel an <Col N="1365" /> unfair decision has been made against them there is a facility to investigate it.  I am glad also that the Bill aims to balance the rights of students and parents against the effective operation of the school.</P>
    <P>Other important elements in the Bill relate to statutory backing of the boards of management and the lack of coercion in their formation.  The strong protection the Bill gives to the integrity of the examination system is important, as is the recognition it gives to the Irish language and its development, the continued recognition it now gives to the patron, and the relatively new recognition of parents' rights as partners in education. The Bill arose from debate and consensus and will provide a framework for reform and development rather than bureaucracy and an expansion of State control.</P>
    <P>Education should not be regarded solely as a means to an end, a means of getting a job.  It should be regarded as a preparation for life. Some people succeed at school and others do not do so well.  However, what is important is that a child should be able to reach his or her potential and be in a healthy state, physically and mentally, for life after school.  Success in life does not depend on intelligence but on personality and the ability to interact with other people.  People who have a good personality and the ability to interact with other people succeed as well as people with a high level of intelligence.</P>
    <P>We should be looking at gap analysis in the context of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look at the gaps on Committee Stage if the Deputy feels there are so many.</P>
      <P>Gap analysis is very important in that we are looking at primary schools, secondary schools and the possibility of entering university or getting a job, but we are not doing that in the context of the types of jobs that are available.  We are encouraging businesses to set up here, there and everywhere, although I would argue that we are not doing as much of that in the north-west as we could.  We should be linking what is being done at primary level and secondary level with what is being done at third level and this, in turn, should be linked to the types of jobs on offer.  It could be argued that this would not give people a wide education, but a better balance must be struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of physical and social needs, there is a large gap between what is needed and the resources and facilities available.  The Minister is moving in the correct direction in providing resources for people with special social and physical needs.  However, I have reservations about some aspects of the breaking the cycle and other initiatives and a review of them would be useful. Deputy Stanton's comments about the exclusion of a reference to physical exercise were interesting.  I commend the Minister on making PE an examination subject.  Students who do PE <Col N="1366" /> are healthier and perhaps consideration could be given to enabling people to continue it in their employment.  The only exercise most of us get is when we walk from the car to the office, clinic or comhairle ceantar meeting and we would benefit from more exercise.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing the education system dates back to the 1830s.  I welcome the abandonment of the regional education boards.  Accountability will always rest with the Minister for Education.  We are fortunate that we can put questions to the Minister in the House about schools in various parts of our constituencies.  I welcome the flexibility being provided in the establishment of boards of management and do not think too many will opt out.  The Minister has sought to achieve consensus, which will ensure the Bill is a success.</P>
    <P>There is an increased interest in the Irish language and culture.  I learned Irish at school but do not have the confidence to speak it.  I welcome the increased interest in the language.  I look forward to dealing with the Bill in detail on Committee Stage and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to those involved in the education system.  Our wonderful economic growth has been underpinned to a large extent by the outstanding work done by teachers and parents at primary, second and third levels.  At times people have been critical of the general nature of the curriculum and the lack of vocational training at second level, but, as recognised by the ESRI in its recent report, the high level of education given to students laid the foundations for the current economic growth.  The Minister was conscious of this when introducing the IT 2000 programme which is aimed at upgrading technological education in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Prior to the general election Deputy Martin in Opposition assailed the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach &mdash; one of the best Ministers for Education in the history of the State &mdash; about various matters.  Generally his response to her proposals was negative.  He has been in office for eight months, yet he has done little to improve the education system.  As Deputy O'Shea said, the Bill is a damp squib.  While it implements one or two of the changes proposed by Niamh Bhreathnach, it essentially leaves the education system as it is.</P>
      <P>The greater part of the Minister's contribution dealt with how the system has operated for decades.  This is very disappointing given that the Minister seemed to be beavering away for years with interests groups, trade unions, managers and teachers.  He emerged from time to time with various reports, yet all he has ended up with is an anaemic Bill.  This is very disappointing when compared with the outstanding proposals of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very good at renaming colleges as institutes.  During the dying days of the rainbow Government there was much excitement in his constituency at the proposal to upgrade the <Col N="1367" /> Regional Technical College to an institute of technology.  I welcome this upgrading but the Minister has done nothing to fundamentally reform and develop the third level vocational sector.</P>

      <P>There has been a long standing demand by people in north Dublin for the establishment of a regional technical college which would service Swords, Ballymun, Finglas, Coolock, Donaghmede and Raheny which have a total population of between 200,000 and 300,000. The hi-tech Dublin City University is on their doorstep but it is a national university with national programmes which takes in students from all areas.  At one stage the college had more students from a small area of Cork than from a large part of north Dublin.  The Minister should take action on this fundamental part of his portfolio and increase the number of third level institutions.  After eight months in office the Minister, who was very vigorous in Opposition, has done nothing to improve this area.</P>

      <P>The record is clear.  Eight months have passed since this Government came to office &mdash; some Governments lasted only eight months and this Government might not last long either depending on the result of the by-elections &mdash; and the Minister has taken no action.  That is the fundamental problem.</P>
      <P>In regard to disadvantage, only two previous Ministers went against the prevailing vested interests at various levels of education.  Donagh O'Malley decided there would be a second level system for all and Niamh Bhreathnach, one of the most vigorous Ministers, decided there would be a third level system for all and that something would be done about areas of disadvantage.  I live in the postal district of Dublin 17 and in that area, with the postal district of Dublin 10, there is the lowest take-up of third level opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has had eight months to deal with this matter.  The previous Minister, against all the odds, introduced the breaking the cycle scheme.  There was opposition to her proposal, orchestrated by the present Minister.  Some schools said that even though they did not have sufficient numbers they would retain an extra teacher.  Arising from demographic changes, the then Minister decided to send the extra teachers to where they were most needed, the most deprived areas of Dublin city, Cork city, Galway and so on, where there are high rates of unemployment &mdash; in Cork city and Dublin city <Col N="1368" /> there are rates of unemployment of 40 to 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>Eight months after Fianna Fáil came to office, the children have nothing to hope for from the Government.  Breaking the cycle was intended as a developmental pilot scheme which would operate in some of the most deprived areas.  My constituency of Dublin North-East was fortunate to get a number of those programmes, particularly breaking the cycle and the early start programme, which have been successful.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on calling a convention on pre-school education and attempting to include all interests, an objective towards which the former Minister Niamh Bhreathnach had been moving before the rainbow coalition went out of office.  After eight months, however, Deputy Martin as Minister responsible for a crucial office dealing with young children, has not said from where the resources will come.  His colleague sat in that chair a few weeks ago and slashed capital gains tax by 50 per cent.  The budget was geared towards the wealthier sections of the population while there are many thousands of children whose opportunities in education are non-existent.  The Minister has shown no incentive in this regard.  He simply reiterated in legal terms the elements of the failed system.  In his deliberations over three years, the Minister has shown no tendency to target children in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>There are some belated programmes in operation.  DCU which is located in Ballymun, close to Coolock, is beginning to take action.  Mr. Tom Murphy, provost of Trinity College, recently expressed concern about how the college, which is located in the inner city, will interact with the inner city.  After 400 years the provost is rightly concerned about the relationship between those in the college and the young people who live in the area.  The Minister's role should be to give leadership.  He did the opposite in Opposition and tried to encourage vested interests in third level education to put barriers in the way of working class children, preventing them from gaining access to third level education.  He orchestrated that campaign.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had eight months to consider the early start programme, which has been enormously successful.  He must have visited some of the schools where it is in operation and seen the enormous benefit to children of two and a half to three and a half years. When will the Minister introduce fundamental initiatives to build on the work initiated by the former Minister Niamh Bhreathnach?  She proceeded against opposition from vested interests who did not believe that resources should be targeted where they are most needed.  I hope the Minister initiates developments in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his steps in technological education, which are innovative.  The programme <Col N="1369" /> was launched in the Taoiseach's alma mater in my constituency, but it was not possible for me to be present that morning.  I presume every child in first level and second level will have access to computer technology.</P>
    <P>The Deputy from Donegal who has just spoken congratulated the Minister on abandoning the proposal by the education forum to establish regional education boards.  Nobody wanted to see £40 million spent on shifting bureaucrats around the country, providing them with expenses and so on.  The idea behind the regional boards was to create a modern democratic structure for education so that there would be accountability to this democracy.  That was the central objective of the Bill introduced by Niamh Bhreathnach, but the Minister has walked away from it and restored the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>As I asked in recent weeks, when will disadvantaged status be granted to Scoil Eoin in Kilbarrack, which is a denominational school and a gaelscoil?  It is the Minister who must make a decision on matters such as that, but he seems to have taken no initiative in that regard since coming to office.  There is reference to the poverty strategy and clear accountable procedures to give extra resources to schools, but there are no initiatives in regard to disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there are no proposals in the Bill to decentralise education.  I accept there were difficulties with the existing local bodies, the vocational education committees.  Debates took place in the Dáil Chamber and at various committees of the last Dáil on the performance of those committees and the idea of merging them with education boards.  Since the Minister abandoned the proposal by the previous Minister, he should at least provide for another type of decentralised procedure.  The Minister envisaged that as being too difficult, and just walked away.  The fear is that he abandoned much of the research and many ideas.  The regional boards were proposed after a great deal of consultation with parents, school managers and trades unions.  The Minister has opted for the easy answer.  Rather than pushing the boat out in this area and letting Cork look after Cork schools and Dublin look after Dublin schools everything must be channelled through the centralised monster of Marlborough Street where the Minister presides.</P>
    <P>One of the glaring errors in the Bill is that the Minister has not imposed any statutory obligation on boards of management as far as I can see.  We are told, for example, there are still at least 100 schools in which there are effectively no boards of management.  Although the Minister has had a great deal of time to think about it in Opposition and prepare a Bill, there will not be statutory obligations in that area.</P>
    <P>Effectively, the Minister has also agreed to support the exclusion of parents and teachers from the management and development of their schools.  This is an area to which the Minister would be advised to return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister, has depleted the range of <Col N="1370" /> support services in education.  There were support services running through 12 key areas in the Bill produced by his predecessor Niamh Bhreathnach. They included areas such as assessment and psychological services, an area in which we want the Minster to introduce significant initiatives, technical aid and equipment for students with social needs and their families, provision for primary and post-primary students with special needs, teacher welfare services, and curriculum support and staff advisory services.  In addition, in the Education Bill, 1997, the then Minister also included provision for management services, industrial relations services and legal services. Like all the Opposition Deputies who have studied the Bill, I miss the provision for planning and the development of an education plan for a school which was contained in the last Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill in general but it does not go far enough and that is my biggest complaint.  It gives a more central role for parents, allows for greater accountability of schools as far as results and performance is concerned, and proposes an appeal system for parents.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of student councils in second level schools.  That was badly needed in the past to give young people a say in their education system.  It exists at third level and it must we welcomed at second level.  It is important that young people's voices are heard in the education system as young people are well capable of seeing inadequacies.</P>
      <P>Phrases such as &ldquo;wherever practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; are used throughout the Bill, and there is no commitment in certain areas. There is a hope that things will happen, but there is no guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 refers to children with special needs. There are big problems with children who are constantly disruptive or who cannot be sent to school because of educational difficulties or because they have been troublesome in the past. There are no proper facilities or psychological services for such children.  There are only four schools to cater for this growing problem, one of which is in Galway in the Western Health Board region.  There is a great deal of frustration among a number of parents of such children.  Children who have been expelled from other schools have <Col N="1371" /> nowhere to go, and that issue must be addressed. Some of these children &mdash; there are approximately 60 in Dublin &mdash; are not being admitted to other schools and facilities must be made available for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of students who experience educational disadvantage.  There are many children who would have gone to special schools in the past who now go into the mainstream education system and do not get the proper back-up resource there.  I could list numerous cases where this is happening, where the school does not get the services of a remedial teacher even for a couple of hours per week.  It is very difficult to ask parents to put such children into mainstream education when they do not receive proper back-up.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we tried to get a computer for a primary school pupil whose needs demanded it.  It is nearly impossible to get such basic resources for a school.  I will list some the instances to the Minister afterwards.  These difficulties create great problems for parents.  It is very frustrating to have to decide whether to send a child into mainstream education or into special schools where there are facilities and the classes are smaller.  At the end of the day, children receive the resources there, but it would be great if we could have these children attending mainstream education.</P>
    <P>It is great to see that the boards of management are to have a greater role.  However, with that in mind I hope they will receive more resources.  I am afraid it will be difficult to get parents to participate because of the increased workload.  It is important that parents take an active part on boards of management.  We do not want to discourage them from taking an active role.</P>
    <P>I welcome the student councils, but it is a pity that students do not have a voice on the boards of management.  That should be put on a statutory basis.  Where there are student councils, they should have an automatic seat on the boards of management to put forward the views of students. This facility exists in universities where a representative of the student union is a member of the governing body.  The same should apply with second level boards of management to give young people a voice.</P>
    <P>The appeal system does not go far enough. Teacher behaviour cannot be appealed and there are a number of cases throughout the country where children are being victimised by teachers. It is a small number of cases but it occurs, and there is no appeals mechanism to cope with it.  If a student complains to the board of management, he or she gets into further trouble with the teacher when the teacher realises the pupil went to the board.  The child will be victimised further. A case came to my attention recently where parents had to take their children out of the school because the family in question was being victimised by a number of teachers.  There were two <Col N="1372" /> families being victimised by teachers and they had no redress.  That leads to a great deal of frustration as parents must look for another school for their child half way through the academic year, and it is unfair.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to educational disadvantage.  There is a drop-out rate of between 25 to 30 per cent in second level schools.  That means 25 to 30 per cent of young people who begin second level education emerge without a qualification and there are major problems of adult illiteracy. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, has responsibility in this area and he has spoken about it on many occasions.  The problem of adult illiteracy must be tackled at primary and second level. Some young people entering second level education are not able to read or write.  If we do not invest resources in primary education and reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, serious problems will arise in second and third level education.  A number of reports indicate that this will cause difficulties for the adult population in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that religion will become an examination subject.  He should consider including politics or current affairs as examination subjects because, in recent years, many young people have become disaffected with politics and the political system.  They should have a better understanding of that system and knew how to mark a ballot paper.  The vast majority of people do not know how the PR system works. At the recent election I had to explain the workings of that system to people who have worked as tallymen for many years.</P>
    <P>In the past civics was included on the syllabus but it was not taught in many schools, including the second level institution I attended.  There is a need to introduce a subject of that sort which, perhaps, might include a mixture of current affairs and environmental topics.  This would give young people a greater understanding of their environment and how administration and government work.  Hopefully, knowledge of the system's workings would encourage more young people to take an active participation in society by casting their votes at elections.</P>
    <P>I am glad the National Council for Curriculum Assessment will be placed on a statutory footing. I welcome this important development.  I intend to raise these points on Committee Stage but perhaps the Minister will consider them in the interim.  I hope he will agree to some of my suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to boards of management, which have not been placed on a statutory footing.  He stated that there are approximately 100 schools which do not have boards of management.  The Minister should reconsider this issue because it is important that parents be given a say in how their children are educated and that they have an input into the operation of schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to education in general, there is a need to put in place resources in many facilities &mdash; be they special schools or normal schools &mdash;<Col N="1373" /> to cater for the needs of children with disabilities. There is much frustration on the part of the parents of these children.  I accept that the allocation of such resources would have to be done in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children.  These children are the silent minority in society and it would be a pity if we were to discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios in primary and second level education in Europe.  Remedial resource teachers are included in that ratio which is wrong.  We must reduce the pupil-teacher ratio if we are to tackle problems such as illiteracy and difficult children who on progressing to second level may be expelled.  Many of these problems could be resolved at primary level if adequate resources were put in place.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the issue of psychological services.  Are the people who enter the psychological service active in the teaching profession?  Are they being removed from the system and trained in the provision of psychological services or are they students of psychology who have been trained to enter the education system?  It is important that those providing this service are qualified psychologists because they will face many serious problems in dealing with children from deprived and disadvantaged areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be taken today.  Special notice questions were tabled in respect of it but they were disallowed.  Therefore, I sought to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue arises from media and other reports of a meeting of the board of Aer Lingus on Monday last.  It is alleged that, in the course of a wide-ranging debate, the different options in respect of the future ownership of Aer Lingus and its subsidiary, TEAM, were discussed.  In the context of any future strategic alliance on the part of Aer Lingus, it was strongly suggested that the company has no future while TEAM remains on its balance sheet because no one would be interested in such an alliance on those terms.  Be that true or otherwise, the discussion developed into dealing with the various scenarios regarding what might happen to TEAM if the deal was rejected by the unions or other interests.  In that context, it was stated that a loan was advanced from the parent company, Aer Lingus, to TEAM of £65 million in 1995 which is reviewable at the beginning of this year.  In the context of this review, it was allegedly suggested that this loan might not be continued.  Without the loan, the finances of TEAM &mdash; which has been placed on a viability route and has made good progress &mdash; would be <Col N="1374" /> put in jeopardy.  Examinership or receivership would be a direct consequence of the forfeiture or withdrawal of this loan.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Adjournment debate is to clarify if there is a threat of the £65 million being withdrawn if the deal is rejected.  Is the Government in a position to dismiss that assertion, state that it is utterly without foundation and that there is no linkage between a dated review of the capital and the proposed sale?  It would be very serious if such a threat existed or if the proposed sale to FLS Aviation were to lead to redundancies through closure of TEAM.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise stated that there must be worker concurrence for the deal, in respect of which Mr. Gerry Durkan has been appointed as facilitator, to proceed.  Does this mean that all 1,200 workers and all the unions involved must accept the deal or does it mean that a majority of either the unions or the workforce must accept it?  In other words, the term &ldquo;worker concurrence&rdquo; is subjective and may cause difficulties.  If there is an effective veto of the deal by the workers, the Government must state its position clearly.</P>
    <P>The Minister's handling of this issue shows her to have one eye on self-preservation and the other on the Dublin North by-election.  It is time the Government stated its exact position on this matter.  It cannot take a neutral stance or remain on the fence.  As the shareholder, the Government either supports or opposes the deal.  It cannot pretend that there is no formal proposal and that it does not know what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she does not know what happened at the board meeting.  She also indicated that she is unaware of the current situation because a formal proposition has not been put to her.  I suggest she has a meeting with the chairman, Mr. Bernie Cahill.  Will she look at her relationship with the board because it, including the chairman, acts to represent her interest?  She is the sole shareholder as the appropriate member of Government and it would be normal, if not prudent, that the relationship between the Minister and the board should be such that she knows what is going on and that she makes it her business to know whether there is such a threat.  It is about time we had realistic, forthright and straight answers to such complex issues.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that we have an FLS Aerospace due diligence process and I strongly urge all interested parties to meet &mdash; FLS and the unions &mdash; to put forward a strategy for the future of TEAM, including job security, pay and conditions and all other concerns of the unions and workers.  That seems to be the orderly way to proceed so that fears can be allayed and the company can say it intends to expand the business and make jobs more secure.</P>
    <P>I seek an assurance from the Minister.  Is there a threat that if the deal is rejected the plug will be pulled on the money involved, amounting to £65 million?  I hope she clarifies this for the very concerned workers and others.  What is meant by <Col N="1375" /> worker &ldquo;concurrence&rdquo; as it is a very vague term?  What is the Minister's relationship with the chairman and board?  They seem to be acting in one republic and she in another.  At the end of the day they will have to get together if the deal is to be concluded.</P>

      <P>The Minister expresses her apologies to the House and Deputy Yates for her absence.  I understand she has already spoken with him to explain the reasons she cannot be here.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to the possible sale of TEAM Aer Lingus to FLS.  The House will recall that when answering questions on this subject on 16 December 1997, the Minister stated on a number of occasions that there would be no strategic developments in regard to TEAM without the concurrence of TEAM employees and there has been no change in this position.  The House will also be aware, that subsequently Aer Lingus announced it had identified FLS Aerospace as its preferred investor.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that all issues surrounding the possible sale of TEAM to FLS are currently being addressed by management and employee representatives and are varied and complex.  It would be inappropriate to comment on those issues in advance of receiving any formal proposal from the board of the Aer Lingus group in the matter.  However, I emphasise that no proposals have yet been made to the Minister in this regard.  Any such proposal is, in the first instance, a matter for the board of the Aer Lingus group and any recommendation to the Minister from the board will be considered on its merits, having regard to the interests of all relevant parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated to management and unions that any agreement to sell TEAM will require the agreement of the workforce in the company.  This was reiterated by her earlier today in response to parliamentary questions on the subject.  She has placed strong emphasis on this point and this is a view which is very much shared by her Government colleagues. It is her strong belief that constructive discussions between both sides, with the assistance of the agreed independent facilitator, with full regard for employee rights as well as the commercial issues on all relevant matters, is the way forward in order to ensure the best results for the company and staff.</P>
      <P>The desire to ensure a long-term viable future for TEAM will be the Minister's prime concern in examining any proposal from the board.  Her priority is to ensure that the prospects for maintaining and strengthening employment opportunities at TEAM are maximised in the years ahead.  This is also the main concern of her Cabinet colleagues, whom the Minister keeps regularly informed on developments in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Minister for Defence to go to the High Court tomorrow comes at a time when cases have increased from 100 to 160 per week.  Will he clarify the nature of the appeal, whether he intends it to apply to all cases or is the application on notice to all the claimants who might be affected by the adjournment if granted?  Is he working on other strategies?</P>
      <P>Is he satisfied that the expert group, given the method of appointment by the State, will be accepted as an impartial group?  I accept the integrity of those serving on this group but why did he not go to the court immediately on establishing the expert group?  Will he explain the delay in establishing the expert group and why its first meeting was only held on 10 December 1997, despite discussions in the Dáil in October and November?</P>
      <P>I condemn the reply to my parliamentary question when I asked for details of the expert group two weeks ago.  There are potentially 50,000 claims leading to a cost of £1.5 billion as a conservative estimate, some reach £4.5 million.  It is a time of unprecedented low morale in the Defence Forces and it will take an enormous amount of time for them to recover from the derision, jokes, ridicule and general undermining which has occurred in recent times.</P>
      <P>This has been created and fed by the large number of compensation claims, many of which it is said would not receive compensation in other jurisdictions.  It appears that the media campaign of recent weeks, far from reducing the number of claims, has in fact increased them from 100 to 160 per week.  Action other than a media campaign is necessary.  The reality of the Defence Forces' position here is that there is no other system in place for personal injuries, other than the courts.</P>
      <P>The other reason that we have the extraordinary situation is that internationally agreed hearing test assessments from America and the UK are not acceptable in Irish courts.  This is a mysterious situation and the attempted remedy now is to create our own standard.  The question arises that if the UK and American standard is not acceptable in the court, why should an Irish standard prove any more acceptable?</P>
      <P>The implications of this are serious for the Minister's current strategy although I accept the expert group is attempting to obtain a standard scientific assessment and measure of hearing loss and relating it to handicap.  There has been a great deal of talk about the number of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also clear that the number of claims appeared to increase dramatically at one point following the leaking of advice given by the Attorney General in 1993, which contained <Col N="1377" /> advice to the State, and apparently making its way into the hands of plaintiffs.  It stated that &ldquo;if these cases make their way into court they could not be defended&rdquo; and &ldquo;advice from the Attorney General's office in circulation is that in the great majority of cases the information upon which the Army would have to rely in order to establish a safe system of work is simply not available and therefore the plaintiff's case cannot be contradicted and this applies particularly to personnel who served and fired weapons prior to 1987&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department made a statement today confirming the advice given in 1993 was that the State would not be able to defend these cases.  The cases escalated out of control at that point and people clearly took advantage of that leak.  It is important that genuine claimants can seek redress for damage done to them by way of their experience through their work in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>However, if claimants are currently receiving compensation for zero handicap it raises the most serious questions of the exposure of the State, the impact on the taxpayer, the impact on social services and the morale of the Defence Forces in general.  The Department of Defence is now looking for 20 extra staff, the Chief State Solicitor's office has 32 staff working on this while last week the Department had no one available to attend a case in Limerick.  This is indeed a crisis.</P>
    <P>We need to develop a compensation board within the Army, which can use an agreed standard and agreed criteria for compensation on differing levels of hearing loss.  This has been done in other countries.  We also require the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal, a national claims management agency.  It is extraordinary that only last week a claims manager to handle these cases was appointed.  The State must act across Departments, initiatives must be taken by Government and steps must be taken to protect and try to repair the damage that has been done to the reputation and morale of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Minister sends his apologies for being unavoidably absent.  I will draw to his attention the Deputy's comments, particularly the proposals she made towards the end of her contribution.</P>
      <P>This gives me an opportunity to make a statement on the Army hearing loss litigation about which all sides of the House are deeply concerned.  I do not wish to go over old ground unnecessarily.  I am sure Deputies are familiar with the current position in which more than 11,500 serving and former personnel of the Defence Forces have initiated legal claims against the Department of Defence for alleged hearing loss caused in the course of their service with the forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of those cases, some 1,539 have been finalised at a cost of £41.679 million which includes £5.890 <Col N="1378" /> million in plaintiffs' legal costs.  While some 51 cases were withdrawn or dismissed by the courts when litigated to finality by the State, the situation has remained bleak in prospect until the present.  Deputies will be aware that the key issue in this litigation is the absence of a system of assessing hearing handicap acceptable to the Irish courts.  Such a system is being prepared by a committee of experts assembled under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.  I have been reliably informed that its deliberations will be complete and a report issued by the end of this month.  The imminence of this expert report and the coincidence of this fact with a reserved judgment awaited in one of the hearing loss cases has convinced me that the time is now opportune to apply to the High Court for an adjournment of all these cases.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that an application for such an adjournment will be made before the High Court on Friday, 6 February 1998, it would be inappropriate of me, and disrespectful to the courts, to attempt to rehearse at any length the arguments which will be adduced to persuade the High Court that such an adjournment is warranted.  In these circumstances, I trust Deputy Fitzgerald appreciates the position.</P>
    <P>If the High Court decides to grant an adjournment of these cases it will provide a breathing space in which we can await the publication of the Department of Health and Children's expert group report on hearing handicap assessment.  At the same time the reserved judgment of the High Court in a certain hearing loss case can also be awaited.  In so far as this case may have points of general application to other cases it, too, will be of tremendous interest.  It is the Government's intention, when the report becomes available, to adduce it in evidence before the courts and then present it with the other best evidence which the State can provide.  It will be then up to the courts to adjudicate on the matter.</P>
    <P>I trust Deputies will bear with me when I say that I do not wish to be in any way previous or presumptuous in anticipating what decision the High Court may or may not reach in these cases. The absence of a hearing handicap assessment system has been identified by commentators and Judiciary alike as a major impediment in processing these cases.  We are attempting to fill this need and to provide the requisite information to the courts.  It will be for them to decide how they should treat it.  In the meantime, it is the Government's considered view that, pending such judicial adjudication on the forthcoming handicap assessment system, when available, it will be in order to halt the processing of Army hearing loss cases through the courts until they have had an opportunity to receive and consider it.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies and the wider public that we are fully seized of this enormous issue and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the interests of the taxpayer are fully protected.  At the same time, we must have equal regard to the <Col N="1379" /> rights of those who may have suffered a significant injury to receive appropriate compensation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to make this statement and trust she understands the imminence of tomorrow's court case prevents me making further comment on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this question to discover why the Minister for Health and Children is hiding information, he seems to have gone into hiding rather than coming into the House to reply to this debate.  It is ironic that this House recently passed an Act which enables people to have freedom of information on abortion, yet I am seeking freedom of information on research on abortion.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the matter. The Minister for Health and Children is reported in an article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> as stating that he will not release recommendations which form part of the research project on unwanted pregnancies.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter, but received a grossly inadequate and misleading reply.</P>
      <P>This research was commissioned by the previous Government as part of a strategy to address the increasing level of Irish abortions.  A sum of £100,000 was allocated to fund research by TCD. The Irish taxpayer paid for the research and the Irish citizen has a right of ownership over it.  It is the first serious investigation into why so many Irish women, in ever increasing numbers, are having abortions.  It will help to lift a veil of silence and mystery that has surrounded this issue.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, as with any research, the recommendations are a crucial part of the findings.  Yet the Minister intends to publish what is, in effect, a censored, truncated and emasculated report with its central part excised.  The reason given is that he does not want to give the impression that he or the Government endorse any position on abortion ahead of the Green Paper which is to be published.  This is an extraordinary statement for a Minister to make.  It displays an arrogance that I, not just as a public representative, but as a citizen of the State, find unacceptable.  It presumes the public is unable to differentiate between a recommendation and policy.  The Minister has also taken it upon himself to presume what is best for the people to read; presumably, for the good of our souls he is protecting us from ourselves. He reminds me of one of those busybodies who used to desecrate books in public libraries by tearing out the pieces they found offensive so that the rest of us would not be besmirched.  It appears the Minister intends to excise the pieces of this research project he believes we cannot be trusted to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These recommendations have a relevance now, not at some time in the future.  They cannot be put on the long finger in the way the Minister did in regard to legislation on abortion.  He has <Col N="1380" /> devised a lengthy and carefully crafted process which will mean the Government will not have to face up to the substantive issue for a long time. In the meantime, the rate of Irish women having abortions continues to increase.  One in ten pregnancies end in abortion and the rate will inevitably continue to increase unless a strategy to prevent crisis pregnancies is put in place urgently by his Department.</P>
    <P>The recommendations we are being denied are important, not only for the Department, but for political and professional people who wish, as I do, to develop and put in place an effective and safe prevention programme.  It is neither medically nor socially desirable that we should have such an increasing rate of abortion.</P>
    <P>By censoring this important research the Minister is guilty of extending the delay in bringing about a reduction in unwanted pregnancies and, consequently, in the level of Irish abortions.  He is not a man known to be afraid, but to deny the public a right of access to vital recommendations that should be available to the public can only be described as an act of cowardice.</P>
    <P>I do not want another increase in abortion figures this time next year and I am sure neither does the Minister.  I urge him, therefore, to do the right thing, to publish the full report and treat the public in a serious and accountable way rather than like children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for raising this matter.  I apologise on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for his inability to be here.  I am glad to have this opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, to set out the position on this important issue.</P>
      <P>This study was commissioned from the Department of Sociology of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1995 by the then Minister for Health as part of a comprehensive approach to the abortion issue.  It followed the passing of the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995.  The objective of the study was to assist the Department in understanding the factors which contribute to unwanted pregnancy and in particular those factors which lead to women seeking abortions. It was hoped that with a better understanding of these factors, the Department of Health would be in a better position to target preventative policies where they would be most effective.  In particular, it was hoped that the results would be useful as a basis for the development of properly targeted education programmes to help reduce unwanted pregnancy.  I emphasise it is equally the concern of the Government that strategies be developed which will aim to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and comprehensive counselling and health care for women with crisis pregnancies should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study commissioned from the Department of Sociology in Trinity College involved extensive <Col N="1381" /> field work, involving interviews with women with crisis pregnancies some of whom had opted to keep their child, some of whom planned to have the baby adopted and others who had chosen abortion.  It had been hoped that the results of the study would be ready in the spring of 1997.</P>
    <P>However, the fieldwork process and the task of writing the report took the research team somewhat longer than had been anticipated.  Consequently the draft report was received by the Department of Health and Children on 9 December 1997.  I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, to compliment the research team on the sensitive manner in which it carried out its work and for the comprehensive report which will shortly be finalised and which will help to inform public debate on this difficult issue.</P>
    <P>On 2 December 1997, shortly prior to receipt of the draft report, the Government had decided to establish a Cabinet committee to oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task will be to prepare a Green Paper on abortion.  This work is under way.  Submissions from interested parties and the public generally have been invited and the objective will be to have the Green Paper completed in the summer.</P>
    <P>The draft report submitted by the Trinity College research team contained a number of policy recommendations made in the light of their findings.  The Minister for Health and Children was, and remains, of the view that it would not be appropriate to publish an important report containing recommendations, while a consultation process leading to the preparation of the Green Paper is under way.  To do so would, no doubt, lead to the Government being accused of attempting to influence the debate or of endorsing certain positions on the abortion issue in advance of the preparation of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>The Trinity College research team, with whom the Department has discussed the matter, are of the view that the publication of recommendations could deflect the debate from the research findings, which are of paramount importance.  The Department has suggested that the team considers making a submission to the working group which is preparing the Green Paper on abortion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has no difficulty with publishing this research, the final version of which will contain detailed findings and conclusions based on the team's research. This position was conveyed in reply to Question No. 3, from Deputy Shatter, on 29 January 1998. The response to Deputy McManus's Question No. 52 &mdash; of the same date &mdash; addressed the points she had raised.</P>
    <P>The Trinity College research team is finalising its report on the basis which I have described.  It is also taking the opportunity to carry out some minor editing of the text.  The report is expected to be ready within a matter of days.  The Minister will be proceeding to make arrangements for its publication and placing on public sale as soon as possible after that.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter as an item on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, and wish her well in her Department.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I raised this issue in the public arena and attempted to generate a debate around the issue of how men are perceived and perform in modern society.  I am pleased we can at last debate this issue in the House because it is one that has been debated throughout the country during the past number of weeks.  That debate is useful.</P>
      <P>As with any creation, like any Frankenstein created, one is never sure of the final outcome.  I have been open to suggestions from a variety of sources, since I first mooted this idea, as to how best to proceed from here to empirically study the issue of men and how men perform in modern society in a number of key areas.  My proposal for a commission on the status of men is one among many.  I am open to the views of the Minister and the Government about how to proceed.</P>
      <P>For the first time, in 1970, the Commission on the Status of Women drew together much of the national and international work on the issue of pay and conditions for women.  If it was right in 1970 and in 1997 to address the issues of women's place in the labour market, women's place in the home and their conditions therein, surely it is right that we address the issues of men's place in education, male suicide and male health because we have never had a focus on these issues.</P>

    <P>Little work has been commissioned here on this issue.  A commission could draw together much of the work that needs to be done.  There is one graphic example of the need for such a commission.  A conference took place last year in Helsinki on men and men's health.  At that time the Irish Government could not produce any attitudes or opinions which men had because we had not commissioned the work.  By proposing a commission on the status of men we could put on the record new work which must be undertaken in this area.  There is evidence that boys are falling behind girls at school, particularly in relation to literacy.  There is evidence that suicide among young men has trebled in the past ten years or so. There is no unit in the Department of Health and Children dealing with male health and the particular problems of testicular cancer.  No screening process has been put in place to deal with that issue.  I use these examples not to say they are the be all and the end all of the issue but merely to state we need to address, research and quantify the problems.  The issue of male unemployment and its effects, particularly in unemployment black spots, must be addressed.  I am open on the issue of whether we research this topic from Department to Department or by means of a commission or some other structure, but at least we can begin to debate the matter.  It is right and <Col N="1383" /> proper that this issue becomes a mainstream political issue as in other developed countries.  We are beginning to address the new problems experienced by men in society.  This is not a question of rolling back the stone for women or of diminishing the fantastic results that have been achieved as a result of the feminist movement in the past 20 years.  This is about facing up to new problems and new situations in which men find themselves.  By responding, as I have suggested, we will send out a positive signal to men in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I do not see a need for a commission on the status of men. I have listened with interest to the arguments which have been advanced in recent weeks for such a commission.  Among the diverse issues which have been raised in this context are the high incidence of suicide among men; health care for men; the decreasing role of men in teaching; the rights of fathers in relation to their children; how advertising presents men; the problem of male crime and how boys fare in the education system.</P>
      <P>I accept these are serious issues and I do not wish to belittle them.  I recognise the economic and social developments of the past 20 years or so which have had some adverse effects on men. I have in mind, for example, the disappearance of many of the traditional forms of male industrial employment; the alienation and marginalisation of men in disadvantaged urban housing estates, and the steady attrition of the farming population.</P>
      <P>What is being mooted, however, is a commission on the status of men.  The establishment of such a commission would seem to suggest that, in some way, men stand at a disadvantage in society.  I cannot accept this.  I recognise men face a diverse range of difficulties and that, for some men, the social and economic developments of recent decades have been threatening, disturbing or downright unpleasant but, taken in the round, men hold the greater power in society.  I do not believe there is a fundamental problem with the status of men in society.</P>
      <P>The suggested creation of a commission on the status of men seems to imply that the problems which have historically faced women throughout the ages have been resolved and that women have overtaken men as part of a privileged sector of society which needs no further official support. This is far from true.  While we have succeeded in changing the role of women in society dramatically over the past 30 years, it is clear there is still much to be done if men and women are to enjoy equality of status and opportunity in the workplace and society as a whole.  The Government is still committed to the promotion of gender equality and, for the moment, recognises the greater needs of women in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> It would be wrong for men or women to believe that Government unthinkingly take sides in the battle of the sexes.  This is not the case.  It is the Government's responsibility to deal with the reality of life as we find it and provide remedies for injustices which are apparent in society. What we are trying to achieve is a measure of real equality between men and women.  In Ireland today women earn substantially less than men. Statistics show that the average hourly earnings of women who work in manufacturing industry are only 70 per cent of those of their male counterparts.  Women tend to be segregated in the low paid sectors of the economy such as the clothing, assembly and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Like other European countries, we have experienced a strong increase in labour market growth.  In the 25 years from 1971 to 1996 the number of women at work grew by 212,000, reaching 448,000 in 1996.  This compares with growth of 23,000 in male employment over the same period.  There are more jobs for women and more women have been successful in advancing within employment than at any time before. These figures, however, belie the reality in so far as women at work are concerned.  Growth in jobs has been concentrated in low paid, part-time and other atypical work and it is to these jobs that many of the new entrants to the workforce, primarily women, are recruited.</P>
    <P>The number of women in key decision-making roles in public and private organisations is conspicuously low.  Women are under-represented at board level in major manufacturing and industrial concerns and on the boards of service and financial institutions.  Below boardroom level, the world of work is segregated, vertically and horizontally, with men occupying the majority of management, professional and supervisory positions and women, by and large, responsible for delivery of routine, clerical and support services.</P>
    <P>Women continue to be under-represented in political life, at national and local level.  The composition of the Houses of the Oireachtas is ample testimony to the continuing imbalance between men and women in the political sphere.</P>
    <P>All in all, the work of advancing equality for women is far from complete.  Ours is still a society in which men earn more than women and predominate in the decision-making processes, whether in political, economic, social or cultural life.  Men are not a beleaguered species.  They do not need a commission to act as a counterbalance to the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a commission, on whatever subject, is not something to be undertaken lightly.  To function effectively, a commission needs the commitment of a well-qualified and interested membership.  It requires a dedicated and adequately resourced secretariat.  It must have coherent and well-defined terms of reference and a specific timeframe for delivery of its report.  There is no point in establishing a commission whose remit is diffuse and amorphous. Not alone am I unconvinced of the need for a <Col N="1385" /> commission on the status of men but, given the range of issues which have surfaced in recent discussions about this issue, there is a real difficulty in giving such a commission an appropriate focus. To repeat a comment made on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;, I could see such a commission turning out to be a commission on the status of everybody.  This would be contrary to the principles of efficient delivery of public services and targeted prioritisation of issues which underpin the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>While I accept there are serious problems facing <Col N="1386" /> men in society, I do not see a commission on the status of men as being the way to deal with such problems.  The difficulties faced by men are diverse and require varied solutions but men continue to hold a dominant position in society.  Not alone do I not see a need for such a commission but it would give the wrong signal about equality between men and women and be wasteful of time and resources.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans to engage in or sanction an official cull of seals as the scientific advice is that culling is not an effective method of preventing predation of fisheries by seals.  However, affected persons may apply for permissions under section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, to <i>inter alia</i> kill seals which are causing damage to a fishery and these will receive early consideration.</P>
      <P>University College Cork is undertaking a three year study on the comparative distribution and migration patterns of grey and common seals. This project is being jointly funded by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and my Department.  This study is due for completion later this year and it is hoped it will be possible to quantify and assess more accurately seal populations and their impact on fish stocks around the Irish coast.</P>

      <P>I am unable to comment specifically on the views attributed to the former chairman of the International Whaling Commission, IWC, that Ireland's proposals to the IWC would add approximately 50 whales to the existing worldwide catch.  However, the Deputy will be aware from replies by me to previous questions on this topic, that the existing worldwide catch has increased from 383 whales in 1992 to 1,043 in 1997.  The increase in the take proposed by Norway for 1998 alone would bring the total estimate for 1998 to some 1,200 whales, adding considerably more to the annual worldwide catch than the figure of 50 referred to in this question.  The Irish proposals seek to address the continued uncontrolled rise in the total annual catch and I am confident that the proposals put forward by Ireland to the IWC will, if adopted, reduce the number of whales killed.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  18, Uimh.  24 agus Uimh.  41 le céile.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (&lsquo;the Habitats Directive&rsquo;) was transposed into Irish law on 26 February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. Those regulations fully transposed the directive and contain significant additional provisions relating <i>inter alia</i> to compensation, notification of proposed candidate sites to landowners and objections to proposed designations, on scientific grounds only, and appeals against restrictions.</P>
      <P>The process of designating special areas of conservation, SAC in accordance with the regulations is well under way, in that the main part of what will be Ireland's SAC network, over 200 sites amounting to some 550,000 hectares, has already been publicly proposed for designation and is accordingly protected.  As I informed the House on 27 November and 16 December last, the EU has been notified of our proposals in relation to SAC designations, subject to the outcome of the requisite consultation process.  A number of sites proposed as part of that consultation process are the subject of appeals and I will not formally notify the EU Commission of those sites until the appeals have been resolved.  I hope that this can be achieved by April.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to publish proposals relating to non-priority habitats by mid-1998 and these will be notified to the Commission when any objections or appeals have been resolved.  It is expected that the final element of Ireland's SAC network, comprising marine and coastal sites, will be publicly advertised before the end of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently assessing all aspects of the implementation process in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for The Millennium, in order to ensure the full involvement of all participants in a spirit of real partnership.  Since taking office, I have had meetings with both the IFA and the ICMSA in relation to SACs and other natural heritage issues.  As recently as December last, I met with six other conservation bodies to further progress the level of partnership on this issue.  I hope to announce details shortly of new local liaison structures in relation to SACs and to formally appoint the Appeals Advisory Board. <Col N="1393" /> In 1997, some £480,000 was expended by my Department on aquisition of areas of raised bog. In 1988, my Department has provision of £14 million for non-capital compensation in SAC areas.  In addition, there is a provision of £5.5 million available to my Department in 1998 for capital compensation including the acquisition of land where appropriate.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to proceed as soon as is practical, having regard to available resources in my Department and the museum, with affording autonomous status to the National Museum of Ireland as provided for in the National Cultural Institutions Act of 1997.</P>
      <P>Phase I of the Collins Barracks project for the National Museum has been completed at a cost of £14 million approximately.  Expenditure of the remaining funds on Collins Barracks up to an overall total of £29.5 million is now proceeding as phase II comes on stream.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy recently, PQ Written Ref.  No. 2271/98, detailed planning work is under way in relation to the construction of a new museum at Turlough Park House, Castlebar to house the Irish Folklife collection of the National Museum of Ireland.  I am pleased to record the continued co-operation and commitment of Mayo County Council in bringing this ambitious and prestigous project to fruition under the auspices of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1999 within a budget of £8.53 million.</P>
      <P>The completion of these three major projects will represent an unprecedented development and expansion of Ireland's premier cultural institution.  It will place the National Museum in a position to properly care for, display and interpret Ireland's moveable heritage items for Irish people and visitors alike</P>

      <P>The Nugent Manuscript &mdash; a sixteenth century book of poems, written on vellum &mdash; was deposited on loan with the National Library at the beginning of the 1930s. Following a request by the previous owners, and having regard to legal advice sought, the manuscript was returned to them in 1996.  An offer which took account of three expert valuations received by the library was not accepted by the owners.</P>
      <P>The export of the manuscript to England was authorised by a licence issued by the library, acting for the Minister, in 1997 under the Manuscripts and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945.  A microfilm copy of the book and a high quality photographic record of it is available in the library; thus a licence under the Act could not have been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nugent Manuscript was sold by public auction at Sothebys in London on 11 December 1997 for a hammer price of £140,000 sterling.  Allowing for the fees payable to the auctioneer and for currency conversion and other costs, a hammer price of £140,000 sterling would involve an outlay of up to Ir£180,000.  Having taken account of all relevant <Col N="1395" /> factors including an assessment of the intrinsic value of the manuscript itself, and the possible impact on the market and on the library's ability to acquire other important materials in the years ahead, the library's agent at the auction was authorised by the library to incur a total expenditure of Ir£150,000 to acquire the manuscript.  A substantial supplemental grant was earmarked by my Department to support the library's efforts to acquire the manuscript.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible on this occasion to acquire this manuscript for the National Library.  The approach adopted was the correct one, having regard to all of the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 205 on 7 October 1997.  In the light of my consideration of the issues involved which have become much more complex than those obtaining when my predecessor was in office and, who, after four and a half years in Government, failed to introduce his own long promised major broadcasting legislation.  I am now working on the basis that it will be necessary to bring forward two Bills on broadcasting.  One Bill will have the primary objective of transposing article 3A of Directive 97/36/EC which is designed to ensure continued access for viewers to coverage on free-to-air television of events of major importance to society.  The second Bill will be a more comprehensive broadcasting Bill dealing with other critical issues such as the introduction of digital broadcasting, the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity and measures to support the local radio sector.</P>

    <P>These prosecutions were taken under sections 21, 22, 28, 29, 31 to 41, 44, to 47, 51 and 69 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Section 21 relates to the protection of flora.</P>
    <P>Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 94 of 1997), which transposes the EU Habitats Directive into Irish law, I have the power to specify operations or activities which are considered likely to alter, damage, destroy or interfere with the ecological integrity of the site in question.  To carry out such operations or activities without my written consent, or without reasonable excuse, is an offence, and is subject to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Where I consider that an operation or activity which is likely to damage an SAC site is being carried out or may be carried out, and if an appropriate assessment confirms that damage is likely, I can make application to a court of competent jurisdiction to prohibit the continuance of the operation or activity in question.</P>
    <P>Where an operation or activity has been carried out on a SAC site, which, following an appropriate assessment, I am satisfied will be damaging to the ecology of the site, I can, by direction issued in writing, require the owner, occupier or user of the land of the person who carried out the operation or activity to restore the land in accordance with this direction.  Every direction shall specify the period within which the land concerned is to be restored.  Any person who fails to comply with such a direction shall be guilty of an offence, and subject to prosecution.</P>
    <P>No prosecution has yet been initiated under these regulations.  However, two interlocutory injunctions were granted by the High Court on foot of applications from my Department, prohibiting the commencement of continuance or works damaging to protected areas.  Both of these injunctions were granted during 1997.</P>

This supplementary allocation was made to enable the council to clear in 1997 outstanding grants commitments for conservation works to heritage buildings and thereby to make new grants in 1998 from its 1998 allocation in respect of conservation works to heritage buildings at risk, as identified by the council.</P>
      <P>The total allocation for the Heritage Council in 1998 of £4 million represents an increase of 34 per cent on its original 1997 allocation, and includes a capital grant allocation of £1.5 million, which represents a 15 per cent increase over the 1997 basic capital allocation of £1.3 million.</P>
      <P>I recognise that further additional funding could be put to excellent use by the Heritage Council to support the preservation of historic buildings and for other purposes, and I will be pursuing the question of further increased funding for the Heritage Council in 1999 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Finally, as I have previously informed this House, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey will &mdash; pursuant to the commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce legislation to protect and enhance our built environment and measures to promote the preservation of heritage dwellings &mdash; be submitting a package of specific legislative, administrative and financial proposals for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage for consideration by Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The film industry in Ireland has, since the early 1990s, undergone a period of strong growth, with the consequent expansion of the pool of skills and facilities and services available for film production in Ireland. This has been supported and driven by incentives provided by the Government, in partnership with Irish film industry professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the circumstances of the industry are now very different from those in the early 1990s. Things have moved on both at national and international level.  Technological developments are presenting new opportunities and challenges. Accordingly, it is an appropriate time to review <Col N="1400" /> policy generally in regard to the industry to ensure that we do not lose the momentum gained, that growth and expansion continue, and that our policies continue to be up-to-date and responsive to the demands of the new millennium.  For this reason I have announced that I will shortly be establishing a think tank to draw up a strategic plan for the next ten years which will provide the basis for appropriate, timely and effective policy decisions.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General has advised that it will be necessary to introduce primary legislation in order to establish a system of listing events of major importance to society with a view to ensuring their continued availability on free-to-air televisions envisaged by article 3a of Directive 97/36/EC.

      <P>The proposed introduction by my colleague, the Minister for <Col N="1403" /> Science, Technology and Commerce, Deputy Treacy, of life assurance transparency regulations is the result of a failure by the insurance industry to adapt and respond to the growing demand by insurance consumers for fair and honest disclosure of the risks and benefits associated with purchasing life assurance products.  The Insurance Ombudsman has indicated that a quarter of complaints received in 1995 arose out of dissatisfaction over surrender values of policies and that many complaints occur because of poor communication, lack of understanding of information at the time a policy is purchased and misunderstandings in relation to &ldquo;nil-allocation&rdquo; or &ldquo;noninvestment&rdquo; in assurance and investment policies in the early years.  The Ombudsman also realised that it was also incumbent upon prospective purchasers of life assurance policies to take care to read and understand the policy documentation themselves.  The proposals to introduce a transparency regime will greatly assist in that regard. My Department has been and is engaged in a wide-ranging consultative process with representatives of the insurance industry, consumer interests and other relevant experts in regard to the drafting of the regulations which will provide, as of legal right, for understandable information on essential features and key areas connected with purchasing a life assurance product.  The prime objectives in the formulation of such a regime are: (i) an end to over-complication in the presentation of such products; (ii) the minimisation of mis-selling and confusion; (iii) adoption of realistic investment projections, where relevant; (iv) transparency on charges and expenses; (v) a knowledge of with whom the insurance consumer is dealing and (vi) adequate redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>If these objectives can be achieved, it will represent a major advance in consumer protection and will act as a stimulant towards greater competition not only amongst individual life assurers but also as between the various products on offer by other financial services institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent public hype concerning parts of a particular draft of a confidential discussion document and, in particular, the matter of commission disclosure by brokers, has not helped the consultation process.  The Minister, Deputy Treacy, has found it necessary, in that regard, to issue a press statement expressing disappointment that confidential discussion documents had been disclosed to the media, the details of which are still the matter of consultation with relevant parties.  Nevertheless, as the Minister pointed out, a level of consensus has emerged in relation to the apparant lack of disclosure on the comparative charges of life assurance companies and the effect which those charges, including commissions, can have on the amount available for investment, especially in the early years, and the projected <Col N="1404" /> surrender and-or maturity values of the insurance policy .</P>
    <P>Submissions from various parties on the merits or demerits of the necessity and usefulness of separate commisson disclosure and devising workable formula for an &ldquo;equivalent sales remuneration&rdquo; disclosure regime are under ongoing consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pre-empt or prejudice the Minister's continuing negotiations.  However, it would be useful to put on record the general thrust of the Minister's proposals and to draw attention to some of the salient points, particularly in view of the fact that he is still considering the issues.</P>
    <P>The proposals are aimed at any person who proposes for insurance directly to an insurer or through an insurance intermediary to purchase a life assurance product.  All suppliers of life assurance, that is the companies themselves or acting through an intermediary, must supply to the customer before he-she signs a proposal or application form, information, in writing, in a clear prominent and accurate manner as prescribed in the draft regulations.  Certain information shall be provided relating to full details of the supplier of life assurance including the legal form of insurer's name and regulatory or supervisory authority of insurer or intermediary, including details of the nature of the business relationship between the insurer and the intermediary.</P>
    <P>Information shall be provided concerning the commitment and the actual insurance policy including: (i) information on the benefits and options, the term of and the laws applicable to the contract; (ii) the proposer shall also be notified of the circumstances under which the contract may be cancelled by either party and the arrangements for application of the cooling-off period. The existing cooling-off period of 15 days will continue to apply; (iii) the means of calculation and distribution of bonuses and a statement of the units to which the benefits are linked and, also, the assets underlying unit linked policies shall be provided; (iv) the arrangements for handling complaints about the life assurance policy including independent options such as the Insurance Ombudsman's Office; (v) purpose and intention of the policy, whether it is protection or savings or a combination of these; (vi) type of policy, for example regular premium savings or single premium investment, regular or single premuim pension, critical illness cover or permanent health insurance and whether policies are indexlinked; (vii) the long-term nature of the policy; (viii) a statement related to the cost of the insurance policy and the means and duration of payment of premiums shall be clearly stated; (ix) a prominent statement shall indicate whether the policy acquires a surrender or early encashment value and the consequences of cessation of payment of premiums; (x) a prominent statement <Col N="1405" /> shall indicate that early surrender of the policy, whether through non-payment or premiums or voluntarily, may result in returns which are less than the premiums paid over the same period.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also provide that information shall be available to the policyholder during the term of the insurance contract related to any change in the name, legal form, address, branch name or address of the insurer.</P>
    <P>Widespread support has been received from all parties concerned including the Consumers' Association of Ireland for the provision to the policyholder of a tabular statement showing in each of the years one to five and quinquennially thereafter up to maturity the amount of premiums paid, projected total deductions for expenses including commissions, projected investment growth and finally projected encashment-maturity value.  A statement will also be included as to the effect of the deductions on the assumed percentage rate of return per annum.  The tabular statement will be the essential element of the disclosure package.  Allied to the table will be a number of prominent &ldquo;health warnings&rdquo; indicating essential features and some of the risks associated with the policy, notably the effects of early surrender, the illustrative (non-guaranteed) nature of the rates of return, premium reviews where premium is not guaranteed to provide benefits-returns illustrated, taxation arrangements, long-term nature of the policy and service fees.</P>
    <P>It is intended to make it an offence for any supplier of insurance who knowingly or recklessly makes a false or deceptive statement or dishonstly conceals material facts in order to induce a customer to take out a policy of insurance or who gives a false or misleading impression as to the value of a policy of insurance in terms of its investment performance and-or surrender value.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that the proposals as outlined heretofore not only supplement minimum life assurance policyholder disclosure requirements under EU law but also greatly exceed them in terms of effectiveness, clarity and overall content.  They should also bring about a level of consistency across the insurance industry in so far as consumer protection is concerned and indeed act as a catalyst to encourage other competing financial services providers to institute comparative transparency measures.</P>

      <P>The proposed capital dredging scheme for Drogheda Port is intended to enable the port to continue, and hopefully grow, its business, for the benefit of the region, in the face of ever increasing competition and to meet higher standards required by customers.  Drogheda Port Company has applied to me for a Foreshore Lease, under the Foreshore Acts, 1933 and 1992, to allow the scheme to proceed as proposed.</P>
      <P>Drogheda Port Company has prepared and published an environmental impact statement dealing with a varity of important topics arising. Specifically the EIS examines sediment transport and coastal processes on the beach system at Mornington, Laytown, Bettystown and Gormanston and also the likely effects of the proposed scheme on the mussel fishery at Drogheda.  Submissions have been made to me by a number of individuals and organisations and these are being carefully examined.  Drogheda Port Company is currently undertaking further work on the EIS and will be publishing a comprehensive EIS document in a few weeks' time for public comment.  I shall carefully consider all submissions made to me before coming to a decision, in due course, on the foreshore lease application from Drogheda Port Company.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the proposed capital dredging scheme for Drogheda Port, my Department has provided a grant of £20,000 to Meath County Council towards a study of erosion problems and suitable protection techniques for the beach system referred to.  That study is nearing completion and I expect to receive a copy of the study report shortly.  It may, for example, prove possible to return to that beach system some of the material brought by the tides up to Drogheda Port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As already mentioned, the effects on the mussel industry at Drogheda from the proposed capital dredging scheme are examined in the EIS <Col N="1407" /> referred to and will be further dealt with in the comprehensive EIS document to be published by Drogheda Port Company in a few weeks' time.  In particular, the port company's proposals for replacing existing mussel beds will be outlined. The longer term future of the mussel industry at Drogheda is, therefore, a matter for consideration in that context and also in the context of any plans by the local sanitary authorities for improved sewage treatment for the area.  It is my intention to pursue actively with the mussel industry and other parties involved the question of enhancing the scope for quality production of mussels at Drogheda.</P>

In addition my Department has made a special arrangement with Mullinahone Co-op whereby they are producing an emergency supply of tags on their premises in Mullinahone. <Col N="1411" />  Under this arrangement, tags can be supplied to farmers who demonstrate an urgent need to move calves born on the holding to sale or on animal health-welfare grounds.

      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by the Department of Agriculture and Food as part of the negotiations in 1994 with the European Commission on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of <Col N="1412" /> the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage &mdash; 62 per cent &mdash; of the overall allocation to the Structural Improvement and Rural Development element of the Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with a number of recommendations and following consideration of their report, certain proposals were put to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes, including the implementation of a £3,024 limit to individual farmers.</P>
      <P>It was agreed in the Partnership 2000 negotiations that these amendments would not come into effect until the beginning of 1998.  However, following further consideration of the matter, I announced on 2 February 1998 that the ceiling for individual payments would be increased to £4,000.  The change now being put in place ensures that all but a very small number of farmers are unaffected, about 1,200 herdowners representing 1.3 per cent of all headage recipients. This group of applicants received an average premium payment of £15,213 in 1996 and applying headage payments ceiling at £4,000 would result in an average combined headage-premia payment in excess of £19,000 for these applicants.</P>

      <P>I am aware of ongoing problems in regard to numbers presenting with prescriptions for methadone in the area mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My Department set up a methadone treatment service review group in January 1997.  Its brief was to assess the use of methadone in the treatment of opiate dependence.  The group's report examines the protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and points to appropriate controls which might be put in place.  It also sets out the basis on which methadone treatment should continue to be developed and recommends a concise framework for the future operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The report specifically includes recommendations that general practitioners and pharmacies should, wherever possible, dispense methadone to patients from the immediate locality.</P>
      <P>A copy of the report has been sent to every general practitioner and pharmacist in the county. The Eastern Health Board is actively recruiting additional general practitioners and pharmacists in each community in Dublin affected by the heroin problem and my officials are in continuous contact with the board regarding drug treatment service developments in the Dublin 8 area.  So far, satellite clinics have been established at Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and Merchants Quay.</P>
      <P>As new doctors and pharmacists come into the methadone scheme, it is expected that this will reduce the number of drug misusers who visit any individual general practitioner's surgery or pharmacy and thus relieve the problems associated with high numbers.</P>
      <P>Only one type of methadone will be available under the terms of the scheme.  Under these terms any person in receipt of methadone must be registered with the central treatment list, must have a treatment card with a named general practitioner and a named pharmacy and may only receive methadone from that pharmacy.  This will lead to restricted numbers attending pharmacies participating in the scheme and should lead to a reduction in social problems associated with large numbers of drug misusers attending one location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other recommendations outlined in the report include: support to general practitioners and pharmacists through the appointment of general practitioner and pharmacist facilitators including close liaison and communication arrangements with health board services in the event of a patient destabilising; contractual arrangements with <Col N="1414" /> general practitioners, pharmacists, etc.; the provision for supervised administration of methadone in cases where a general practitioner specifies the need for this; the introduction of regulations to require that the prescription and supply of methadone be restricted to official prescription forms specifically designed for the purpose; specific training and information for general practitioners and pharmacists on the treatment of opiate dependent persons and methadone monitoring to be placed on a statutory basis by regulation under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>A committee, comprised of representatives from the Eastern Health Board, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Department of Health and Children has been established with responsibility for implementing the recommendations contained in the report.  The committee's main objective will be to ensure that all general practitioners and pharmacists providing methadone treatment do so in accordance with the arrangements in the report.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations in the group's report will result in strict control on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone in the treatment of opiate misuse and will allow for the more even distribution of treatment, thus relieving the problems associated with the area mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The hospital to which the Deputy refers is administered by the Eastern Health Board.  The board's current development plan in relation to the hospital campus provides for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with a reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service provided at the hospital.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>I recently paid a visit to the hospital to view for myself the facilities and services provided.  I have also met with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the development and the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of the campus.  Following my visit to the hospital, the management agreed to submit proposals to me in respect of the most urgent needs for the development of mental health facilities.  I will have these proposals given priority attention as soon as they have been finalised by the Eastern Health Board.  Plans in respect of the development of mental handicap services have already been received and are currently being considered by my Department.  I assure the Deputy that my Department and the board are fully committed to the implementation of the overall development programme for the hospital which will continue in 1998.</P>

      <P>The proposed study in St. Ita's Hospital referred to by the Deputy was one which involved using vitamin D and calcium supplements, which are available on supermarket shelves, to improve the treatment of people with a mental handicap at the hospital.  Clients in St. Ita's include some in the more severe category of mental handicap and many have complicating conditions such as epilepsy or brittle bones.  There is an increased risk of people with brittle bones suffering fractures during epileptic fits.  This proposal was to improve the treatment of the brittle bone condition for this group of clients in order to reduce the risk of fracture.</P>
      <P>The statutory procedures which govern studies, such as the above proposed study, are set out in the Control of Clinical Trials Acts.  1987 and 1990. The Acts set out the procedures to be followed in seeking approval for such trials and the granting of permission by proposed participants, including those circumstances where a person may be incapable of comprehending the nature, significance or scope of consent for this purpose. In addition to client or family consent, three other requirements would have to be fulfilled before the proposed study could have commenced: approval from the hospital's ethics committee; approval from the hospital's management committee; and clients whose families had given consent would, in addition, have to be screened for medical suitability for the study.</P>
      <P>I would like to state that these procedures were being followed in the case of the proposed study in St. Ita's Hospital and that the motivation for undertaking the study was to further the best interests of the clients.  However, in view of the anxiety which has been expressed by families because of the misunderstanding about the nature of the study, the medical practitioner concerned has withdrawn her request for consent from families and has informed the hospital authorities that she will not be requesting the hospital management committee or the hospital ethics committee to consider her proposals for such a study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may, perhaps, have been better if the letter which was initially sent to the parents had contained more information about the proposed study.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board are taking measures to ensure that such misunderstandings should not arise in the future. <Col N="1417" /> Officials in my Department will be raising these matters, as they relate to the mental handicap services, with the programme managers of the eight health boards at their next meeting.</P>

      <P>The operation of the National Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.  The aim of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95 per cent and so eradicate the diseases in question.  My Department is in regular contact with the health boards to discuss the operation of the programme and a meeting in this regard is scheduled to take place later this month.  The most recent figures received from seven of the eight health boards indicate that the uptake levels for completed three-in-one immunisations among children aged 18 months ranges from 72 per cent to 88 per cent. In the remaining board the reported uptake at 12 months is 42 per cent.  I am advised that the actual uptake is significantly better, as the board has a large backlog of claims from general practitioners to be processed.  Additional staff resources have been put in place to address this problem.</P>

    <P>Home helps are, for the most part, engaged on a casual or part-time basis.  A multiplicity of voluntary <Col N="1418" /> organisations are involved in the provision of the service and the rate of payment varies considerably throughout the country.  Information on the number of part-time home helps who are paid over £30 per week at any given time is not readily available.  However, this information is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy when available.  The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 July 1997 is in the range of £212.98 to £225.19.</P>

      <P>Under the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, local authorities have powers to deal with nuisances, including animals kept in such a way as to constitute a nuisance or to be injurious to health, and may make by-laws regulating or preventing the keeping of animals on premises.  The Control of Dogs Act, 1986, and regulations made under that Act regulate the keeping of dogs.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the Acts, regulations and by-laws referred to is a matter for the local authorities, or in some cases, the Garda.  I have no proposals to amend the statutory powers currently available to local authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department assists the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in implementing the cultural-tourism aspects of the Northern Ireland-Ireland Interreg Programme 1994-1999.  To date 13 projects have been approved with some £2.13 million allocated from a budget of £3.28 million.

To date, the steering committee has taken initiatives in relation to underwater archaeology and historic thatch.  A working group at professional level on undewater archaeology is preparing a specification for a proposed joint North-South archaeological survey of Carlingford Lough, which will be submitted to the steering committee for consideration.  A working group on historic thatch is currently carrying out a North-South study on historic thatch, which is expected to be published in early autumn.</P>

However, my Department was involved in tripartite discussions with An Chomhairle and the National Theatre Society in 1996 and 1997.  The question of a severance package was discussed at this forum and it was agreed that the best way to proceed was for the National Theatre Society to develop a proposal and submit it to An Chomhairle in the first instance.  The National Theatre Society has prepared and submitted such a proposal and this is being considered by An Chomhairle.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the State purchase of the Lucan Demesne, with the exception of the Liffey Lodge and the Black Avenue Lodge, was completed in August 1996.  The former is being retained by the vendors and the latter is to be purchased when legal title issues have been resolved by the vendors.</P>
      <P>The objective is to establish a Liffey Valley Park which will be co-operatively managed and maintained by the three local authorities concerned &mdash; Fingal, Kildare and South County Dublin &mdash; on the basis of an agreed management plan.</P>
      <P>Since acquiring the property a substantial fence has been erected segregating the Liffey Lodge from the demesne and the necessary legal contracts and agreements transferring responsibility for the management and maintenance of the demesne to the three local authorities concerned were drafted and forwarded in late May 1997 to the local authorities for completion.  To date only one of the local authorities has signed the contracts and agreements.  I am most anxious that the contracts and agreements should also be completed by the other two local authorities without delay so that this amenity can be made available to the public as soon as possible.  Funding for the management and maintenance of the Lucan Demesne will be a matter for the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the future award of increments, if any, to the teachers will be deferred by the period for which the teachers will be out of service. Similarly, the break will affect superannuation entitlements by 12 days.  This is in line with existing and long established practices from which, regretfully, there cannot be any deviations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  There are 103 one <Col N="1426" /> teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country which includes the school to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Since there are no teaching posts available for allocation to these schools, I am examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.</P>
    <P>My Department's capacity to allocate child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area. Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>To date, all such posts have been targeted on special schools and special classes catering specifically for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I will be considering the issue of child care assistant support as part of this review.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a psychological service to all second level schools.  Psychologists serving second level schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  The normal practice is that parents gain access to this service through the second level school attended by the young person concerned. The assessment is carried out in the school.  In special circumstances, for example, if a young person under 18 is not attending school, it may be possible for a psychologist from the Department of Education and Science to carry out a preliminary assessment at home or at another agreed venue.  Multi-disciplinary assessments in a residential setting are not provided by my Department.  Applications for such assessments should be made to the director of community care of the relevant regional health board.</P>
