      <P>A mental health Bill is in preparation and should be published before the end of the year.  The Deputy will have seen statements by the Minister and officials of the Department on that legislation in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware he has changed his promise on the mental health Bill on two occasions?  Last year he said the Bill would be ready in spring of this year and in January he said it would be ready in mid-year.  In response to Deputy De Rossa this morning he said it will not be ready until the end of the year.  Will the Taoiseach explain this slippage in his commitment regarding this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two legislative measures are proposed in this area, a criminal law insanity Bill, which will be ready in the autumn, and the mental health Bill, which will be ready by the middle of the year.  I hope there is not much slippage in that regard.  Both Bills should be before the House for the autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said in November that the mental health Bill would be ready in spring of this year and in January he said it would be ready in the middle of the year.  Will he confirm it will definitely be ready in the middle of the year, which I consider to be June or July, not November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In November I said the Bill would be ready in the spring and in January I said it would be ready by mid-year.  I have been informed that both Bills will be ready for the autumn session.  The mental health Bill, which has more than 100 heads, will update the Mental Treatment Act, particularly the provisions for detention for treatment of mentally disordered persons.  It is major legislation which, I hope, will be passed this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank Bill, which will deal with setting up the European Central Bank, will be debated long before the summer. The Minister for Finance recently gave a commitment, which I repeated, that there would be a debate shortly in the House on EMU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was incorrect yesterday in saying there was a debate on Dáil reform last autumn.  There was a debate two to three years ago on Dáil reform and the matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Will the report of that committee be sent back to the Dáil so that we can debate the <Col N="1251" /> matter and update procedures such as Question Time?  There was no debate on this matter for some years and the system is out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected if that matter was not debated in the House, but it was certainly debated in committee.  It was that report that led to changes in the committee structure.  The sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been working on Dáil reform.  I would have no difficulty in that committee reporting back to the House so that we could debate the matter here.  That is the way we have always dealt with Dáil reform.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago the Taoiseach said the housing, traveller accommodation, Bill was imminent.  Is it any more imminent today?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When will the Gaeltacht Housing (Amendment) Bill to place payments made since 1982 on a proper footing be published?  Following the work carried out by the group established by the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, will legislation be introduced in respect of the control of the cost of building land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the first legislation to which the Deputy referred will be published this year.  With regard to building land, the Bacon report will be published in the coming weeks and the Government will decide what action to take on foot of its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be necessary to refer the report to the Constitution Review Committee or is it anticipated that preliminary work will be carried out in respect of such legislation <i>vis-a -vis</i> planning?  I raise this point because many local authorities are at an advanced stage of consultation in respect of their plans.  If legislation is to be introduced, it will have to be done in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is anxious to wait to see the report which focuses on house <Col N="1252" /> prices and other relevant issues.  I have no doubt that it will include information on many of the issues about which local authorities are concerned. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will also put forward suggestions and ideas about how we should pursue this issue.  However, we want to consider the report's recommendations before specifying the action we intend to take.</P>

      <P>We were promised a debate on the rights of children.  Is it guaranteed that this debate will take place before the end of the current session, particularly in view of serious reports about homelessness among children and young people and their exploitation in terms of prostitution?  Will the debate proceed before the Easter recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if possible.  Such debates are a matter for the Whips to arrange.  A debate will take place on Iraq tomorrow.  It is easy to refer a matter to the Whips but they must rearrange schedules to make time available for debates.  In this session, debates on the Social Welfare and Finance Bills will take up much Dáil time.  However, I will refer the matter to the whips.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; I am glad, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, of the opportunity to introduce my first Bill in this House.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the various social welfare improvements provided for in the <Col N="1254" /> 1998 budget last December which require legislative changes.  It is the first major legislation to come before the House in fulfilment of the commitments given in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to address the issues of social exclusion, marginalisation and poverty in our community.  This includes delivering on certain key commitments in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for substantial real increases in the value of all social welfare payments; significant improvements in payments for pensioners; the bringing forward of increases in weekly payments by two weeks; fundamental reform of the FIS scheme; additional support for families; special child benefit payment for twins and improved grants for children of multiple births; easement of the means tests for certain social assistance schemes; a firm basis for developing a more integrated administration of our public services; relief to over 1 million workers paying PRSI and a strengthening of the PRSI system with regular actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund.  It also contains a number of other adjustments and amendments to the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The resources provided by the Government in the recent budget for social welfare improvements amount to £125 million this year and £225 million in a full year.  It is the largest budget package for many years, allocating £11 million &mdash; or 9 per cent &mdash; more than was provided in the 1997 budget.  As a result of this year's initiatives, the commitment to spend £525 million on social inclusion measures &mdash; including social welfare rate increases &mdash; during the three year period of Partnership 2000 has been more than exceeded in the first two years.  The increased allocation of £125 million this year will bring overall spending in 1998 by my Department to £4.85 billion.  I will now outline the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains seven parts.  Part l contains the usual provisions of construction citation and continuance of instruments.  Part II provides for the increases in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In our programme for Government we are committed to increasing the rate of contributory old age pension to £100 over a five year period. In recognition of the contribution which our older people have made in developing our economy and improving the quality of life in our community, the Government decided to go beyond what is strictly required by that commitment this year.  Accordingly, it has given a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments to pensioners with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates of pension. The Government is also committed to providing substantial increases in other social welfare payments. In addition, Partnership 2000 guarantees that the real income position of those dependent on social welfare would be protected and enhanced and that the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare would be implemented before the end of Partnership 2000 in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> These special increases in pensions, which represent increases of between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent for those who receive them is a clear indication of the Government's desire to fulfil the promises given in the Government programme. As a result of these provisions 94 per cent of people who rely on weekly social welfare payments will now receive more than the recommended minimum rate of payment of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The implementation dates for these increases is being brought forward by two weeks this year with the result that all the increased rates will be paid from the first week in June.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the increases in social insurance payments of £5 in the weekly maximum personal rate of payments to pensioners aged 66 years and over and in the maximum rates of retirement and invalidity pensions payable to people aged 65 years and over.  All other personal rates of social insurance payments are being increased by £3 per week and payments in respect of qualified adults are being increased by approximately 3 per cent.  Similarly, section 5 provides that social assistance recipients aged 66 years and over will receive a £5 increase in their weekly personal rate and those under 66 years will receive £3 per week.  As with social insurance payments, increases in respect of qualified adults will be approximately 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for increases in child benefit of £1.50 for the first two children and £3 for each subsequent child, bringing the monthly rate of child benefit to £31.50 and £42 respectively.  This section also introduces much needed improvements in respect of multiple births.  The rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins will be one and half times the normal rate.  Also, the grants payable in respect of multiple births are being aligned so that all multiple births will receive a grant of £500 on birth and further grants of £500 at the age of four and 12 years.  These improvements will be effective from September 1998.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for improvements in family income supplement.  For the first time FIS will be assessed on a net basis, that is, gross income less superannuation contributions, income tax and PRSI.  This improvement delivers on the commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate entitlement to FIS on the basis of net earnings.  This scheme is designed to ensure that unemployed people have an incentive to take up work and employees have an incentive to stay in work by providing an income supplement to low income families in employment.  This improvement, which will come into effect on 1 October 1998, will bring an extra 1,600 families within the scope of the scheme in 1998 and about 7,000 in a full year.  In addition to this improvement, section 7 also provides for a general increase of £7 in the weekly thresholds for the calculation of entitlement to FIS from June of this year.  As a result all current recipients will benefit by at least £4 per week.  In overall <Col N="1256" /> terms, the effect of the budget changes will mean that a two child family where the breadwinner is earning £210 per week will gain an extra £18 per week in household income.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for increases in social insurance allowances, thresholds and ceilings. Under this provision the amount of an employee's earnings not subject to social insurance contributions will increase from the current £80 per week to £100 per week.  The threshold under which employers are liable for the lower 8.5 per cent rate of employer contribution will increase from £260 per week to £270 per week and the earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable will increase from £23,200 per annum to £24,200 per annum for employees and from £27,900 per annum to £29,000 per annum for employers. These changes will come into effect on 6 April. Section 9 provides for a similar increase in the income ceiling for self-employed contributors to that of employees, that is, from £23,200 per annum to £24,200 per annum.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for improvements in social welfare schemes.  Section 10 provides for an easement of the rules for assessing means for certain social assistance schemes.  An amount not exceeding the rate of old age contributory pension which is received by way of a foreign social security disability pension will be disregarded from the assessment of means for carer's allowance. Rental income will be disregarded for the purposes of widow's and widower's non-contributory pension where the rent is paid by a person who lives with the widow or widower and that widow or widower would otherwise live alone.</P>
    <P>The first £2,000 of any income received under the special areas of conservation scheme will be disregarded in assessing means for unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age non-contributory pension.  A similar disregard currently operates in the case of REPS income.  I have recently obtained Government approval for a further improvement in this last measure.  I intend to put forward on Committee Stage an amendment to extend this disregard even further.  At present all such income in excess of £2,000 is fully taken into account in the assessment of means.  I propose that in future only half of any remaining income above the £2,000 threshold will be assessed.  This measure will provide a real incentive for many smallholders to avail of these schemes.  The additional cost of this improvement will be approximately £200,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides regulatory powers to prescribe for payments in respect of loss of purchasing power where a claim for a social welfare payment is delayed over 12 months and the claimant is not responsible for the delay.  These powers also provide for payment of costs necessarily incurred by the person in making a claim.</P>
    <P>When a person whose spouse is being paid a carer's allowance to look after him or her dies, the social welfare payment will be paid to the <Col N="1257" /> carer at the married rate for six weeks following the death.  However, carers in exactly the same situation except that the spouse was not in receipt of a social welfare payment do not receive any such payment.  This anomaly is rectified by section 12 which provides that in such circumstances the carer will continue to receive carer's allowance for six weeks following the death.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of concerns regarding the full-time care and attention requirements of the carer's allowance.  I have recently reviewed the operation of this requirement and I am pleased to say that a more flexible approach should be adopted.  Carers may attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities, for around ten hours per week, provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his or her absence. These new arrangements will come into effect immediately.  Furthermore, in the recent budget I extended the free travel pass to all carers in their own right.  This is a clear indication of the Government's policy in relation to the needs of carers.  As Deputies are aware, there is a comprehensive interdepartmental review of the carer's allowance currently being undertaken under the chairmanship of my Department, which will be completed by the middle of the year and further improvements will be considered in light of that review.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends two definitions in the social welfare code.  The definition of &ldquo;child dependant&rdquo; is amended to ensure the continued payment of child dependant allowance where the parent is in receipt of long-term payments and the child has left school and is not entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  It also amends the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in the light of the additional responsibilities assigned since last year.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline a number of new measures the Government has decided to introduce to improve the delivery of public services to the community.  In its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government aims to make public administration more relevant to the citizens for whom the service exists through focusing public administration on the needs of the customer.  The legislative proposals contained in Part IV, sections 14 and 15 of the Bill provide a framework for the development of an integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded income support services.  The main aim of these proposals is to introduce greater coherence to the provision of the various social services by making them more accessible and user-friendly, more co-ordinated, simpler to understand and easier to manage.  This approach will lead to better service for the public and contribute to greater control of schemes.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 provide for four elements: the standardisation of the RSI number as a personal public service number; the introduction of a public service card on the lines of the existing <Col N="1258" /> social services card; the use of new technology on cards to develop new methods of paying social welfare benefits by way of electronic direct delivery to the customer and the sharing of information between relevant agencies for the purpose of determining entitlement to and control of certain means tested social services.  I commend my predecessor for the work done in preparing the interdepartmental report on the development of an integrated social services system, ISSS, which was published in August 1996 and forms the basis for the measures I am taking.  The personal public service number will replace the RSI number currently issued by my Department.  Over 3 million RSI numbers have been registered with my Department since 1979 and they are currently used by several public service agencies, such as my Department; the Revenue Commissioners in tax administration; the Department of Education and Science in the administration of higher education grants; the Department of Agriculture and Food in administering the early retirement scheme for farmers and health boards in administering supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In future it will be used as a key identifier by certain specified agencies.  These include Government Departments, health boards, local authorities, the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, the General Register's Office and the Legal Aid Board.  It is intended to add to this list over time and the Bill provides for this in regulations which require a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The public service card will replace the current social services card, of which over 1.6 million have been issued to date.  The new card will have the person's name, their personal public service number and the card's primary account number visible on front.  The initial cards will contain a magnetic strip on the back with the person's name, personal public service number, date of birth and gender encoded.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Bill, there was a degree of confusion about the intended use of the new number and public service card.  I wish to clarify a number of aspects which have not been fully understood.  First, I assure the House that the personal public service number will not become a <i>de facto</i> national personal identifier. The Bill provides it will act as a single identifier for public administration purposes only and may only be sought by the public service when there is a transaction between the person and the public service.</P>
    <P>I also stress that the public service card will not be a general identity card as the provisions in the Bill make it illegal to use it apart from accessing public services.  For instance, it may not be used for identity purposes by the Garda, publicans, etc. The Bill also contains a proposal to allow for certain information to be placed on commercial cards for the purposes of paying social welfare benefits.  This means social welfare recipients may in future collect their payment via ATMs, banks, supermarkets or a variety of retail outlets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> The Bill includes provision for the sharing of information relating to a number of the most common means tests applied by various Departments or agencies.  For example, a person who becomes unemployed or has separated may have to undergo separate means tests for supplementary welfare allowance, a social welfare payment, a medical card and differential rents in the same week.  This can lead to a great deal of frustration among people accessing these services.  Our aim is to put in place, over time, better administrative procedures by various State agencies which will enable them to share the latest available means data for customers.  The means information will be stored on a central means database which has been developed by my Department and will be accessible to other relevant agencies where a customer has made a claim.  This will help ensure a better and quicker service for the customer and ease difficulties currently experienced in accessing such services.  It is intended the new arrangement on data sharing will apply in the case of social welfare schemes operated by my Department; certain income support schemes provided by the Department of Health and Children; medical cards; higher education grants; differential rents and civil legal aid.  In effect the information required for any of these services will only be provided once.  Similarly, corrections to existing information will also be shared so that a person will only have to tell his or her story once.</P>
    <P>I assure the House these provisions are fully consistent with the provisions of the 1981 Council of Europe Convention, which was ratified by the Data Protection Act, 1988.  I am satisfied the Government has addressed the need for efficient public services and personal privacy protection in a balanced way.  The provisions outlined in the Bill contain adequate safeguards for the protection of the individual's right to privacy.</P>
    <P>For example, it shall be an offence to use a personal public service number and/or a public service card other than for the purposes for which it is intended under the legislation; the holder of a card may at any time request a copy of the information encoded on his or her card and it may be read only by specially programmed computer systems; data sharing will be restricted for the specific purpose of entitlement to and control of certain means tested social services.  While the personal public service number will be widely used, data sharing will only be permitted for purposes specified in law, approved by the Oireachtas and in conformity with established data protection obligations.  Existing data controllers in all Government Departments and agencies, who are responsible for ensuring data protection requirements are enforced, must be satisfied that any proposed data sharing is relevant to a specified lawful purpose.  Under existing legislation, people have the right to receive a copy of any computerised personal information held by a public body.  This will be further <Col N="1260" /> extended when the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, comes into effect in April 1998.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill provides a number of amendments to the social welfare code.  Section 16 is a technical amendment relating to the financial management of the social insurance fund.  Section 17 provides for actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund to be completed on a five yearly basis and the reports of such reviews to be laid before the Oireachtas.  The final report of the National Pensions Board, published in December 1993, included a series of projections setting out the future costs of social welfare pensions.  It also recommended that an actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of these pensions be carried out every five years and I recently published the first such review.</P>
    <P>Section 18 clarifies the entitlement to pre-retirement allowance for separated spouses and consolidates the legislative provisions for the allowance.  Section 19 is a consequential amendment to the provision of an increase of £5 per week in the personal rate of blind pension to those who have attained pension age.  Section 20 amends and extends the recovery procedures for social welfare payments.  It provides for the recovery of money wrongfully received by a person from that person's current or future social welfare payments and avoids unnecessary recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the extension, by three months, of the period in respect of which arrears may be paid in the case of a late claim for certain occupational injuries benefits.  It also provides that decisions regarding the payment of late claims made under regulations will be a deciding officer function and may be appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office.  I recently signed regulations providing for the extension of the period for which late claims may be paid. They provide, in respect of contributory pension claims received more than 12 months late, for payment on a proportional basis where the statutory conditions are satisfied and the claim was received on or after 1 January 1997, and also provide for payments on a proportional basis depending on how late the claim is made.  They permit full retrospection in several limited circumstances, such as incapacity or incorrect information issued by the Department, but I strongly emphasise that everyone should apply for their social welfare entitlements in good time.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that it will be an offence for a person not to comply with a request for information required for the purposes of investigation of entitlement or control of social welfare schemes.  Section 23 provides that the appointment of social welfare inspectors may be delegated to an officer of the Department.  Section 24 provides for a definition of &ldquo;liable relative&rdquo;, minor technical amendments to the liable relative provisions and that the District Court shall, where necessary, decide the manner in which contributions should be made.  Section 25 provides for <Col N="1261" /> the introduction of the provisions of Part V by way of commencement order.</P>
    <P>Part V, sections 26 and 27, provide for the raising of the thresholds from £197 to £207 per week, or in annual terms from £10,250 per annum to £10,750 per annum, above which the health contribution and employment and training levy apply.  These provisions will come into effect on 6 April 1998. Part VI, section 28, amends section 54 of the Pensions Act, 1990, to provide regulatory powers to prescribe information to be provided by the trustees of occupational pension schemes and to whom such information is to be provided.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one of the most radical Social Welfare Bills presented to the Oireachtas in recent years.  It has many facets in that it recognises the contribution our older people have made in building the Ireland of today, while setting out the parameters under which the modern State will develop its public, and particularly its social services, in the new millennium.  For those reasons, particularly for the large increases given in the budget, I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive and useful debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to be able to congratulate the Minister on introducing his first Bill as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs but I cannot as I oppose this Bill.  It is a further chapter in the sorry saga of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and its exploitation of the poor.  The policy is best described as a reverse Robin Hood in that it takes from the poor to give to the rich.  That was evident in the budget, the Finance Bill and now in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is an overflow of funds in the Exchequer. The figures for January showed a surplus of over £100 million.  The Exchequer coffers are bursting but not a penny of the surplus will go to those who need it.  Even last year's social welfare savings of £160 million have not been fully allocated for social welfare increases.  I support savings and control measures in social welfare but surely we should make available as a minimum the amount that was saved last year.  Only £125 million of the £160 million saved last year has been allocated for increases this year.  The balance of £35 million is used for other measures, such as subsidising halving the capital gains tax for the rich.  I do not accept that approach and I contrast it with that adopted by Fine Gael and published in a document I issued when the budget was announced, which advocated fair play.  I do not see any fair play in the Government's approach or in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much to be said for the &ldquo;need over greed&rdquo; approach advocated by the CORI justice commission.  A two tier society is developing under this Government.  Everyone knows the problems associated with widening the poverty gap.  This leads to further exclusion, alienation, crime and an unstable society which is damaging for all citizens.  A social dividend is available to everyone when a genuine effort is made to eliminate <Col N="1262" /> social exclusion.  However, the Government has adopted a contrary approach as epitomised in this Bill.  If this Bill is measured against the Finance Bill which we debated last week, the net result is to widen the poverty gap.  I cannot support that.</P>
    <P>We talk about the costs involved and the level of payment to social welfare recipients.  Yesterday, in reply to a parliamentary question, I was told that ten years ago social welfare expenditure represented 12.3 per cent of GDP.  It is now 9.5 per cent of GDP, if we take into account additions under the Social Welfare Bill.  That large reduction in the percentage of GDP is being used to end social exclusion in society.</P>
    <P>I will speak later about the administration of public service data and the proposed personal public service number.  I want to focus not just on the short-term approach adopted by the Government on social welfare matters but also on the fact that the Bill does not recognise the changing nature of work.  More and more people are now self-employed and many work on contract and part-time basis.  People's work patterns are changing which must have implications for our social welfare system.  Only four sections of the Bill deal with minor improvements in the system.  The Minister has given no recognition to changing work practices and there is no new vision or future strategy to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system is a 1950s model.  It has been improved over the years but the Minister continues to tinker with the old model.  We need to introduce a welfare to work support system. The Minister's speech is supposed to outline his vision &mdash; although there is a lack of vision &mdash; yet it does not seen to recognise the need for this new system.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be tempted to criticise me on the basis that in opposition it is easy to suggest giving money to various schemes.  However, I do not accept that.  Although there is plenty of money available, I want value for money and cost controls.  I supported the rainbow coalition when it introduced control measures at a cost of £10 million which produced savings of £160 million last year, a net benefit of £150 million.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare, which has reached £200 million, is now the fastest growing area in terms of cost.  The Minister has not taken on board my suggestion that control procedures similar to those in other schemes in the Department should be put in place in this area.  Major savings can be made if proper control measures are introduced in the social welfare system.  This was pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in a report a couple of years ago, yet the Minister refuses to accept that advice.  It is necessary to streamline the approach taken when assessing and granting supplementary welfare. This fragmented system has been taken over by the Department.  There is evidence of fraud in that system and of the need for control.  Savings, similar to those made in the past when the unemployment system was carefully monitored, could <Col N="1263" /> be made in the supplementary welfare system.  I am not trying to give money to everyone, only to those for whom it is intended.  I want value for money.  I want more money to be given to those who need it and that would not necessarily mean increasing the overall ceiling on expenditure.</P>
    <P>What should we expect from the penultimate Social Welfare Bill of this century?  It should contain some sense of vision for the welfare system in the next century and millennium.  This Bill does not have that vision.  It contains no strategic direction, the Minister merely tinkered with the old model.  It should include decent improvements along the lines of the fair play approach I advocated at the time of the budget.  The trumpeting about payments for children is a joke because they amount to a mere 35p a week in child benefit from next September.  The Minister's attempt to justify an approach that takes into account the needs of children is pathetic when one considers that payment.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not provide for any increase in the child dependant allowance. That is what we got from a Minister who talks about major improvements in the system.  I am a firm believer in State financial support for children. There was a 60 per cent increase in child benefit during the rainbow Government's time in office.  A further initiative is required in the area of child care.  An allowance should be payable through the child benefit system to support those who want to work outside the home and need support to do so.  It should also apply to wives who want to work in the home.  I proposed that there should be a child care supplement of £360 per child per annum, beginning with all children up to the age of five, but introduced initially in respect of one and two year olds.  The gross cost of this would be £36 million per annum.  That proposal should have been taken on board if the Government were genuinely interested in providing financial support for child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept that, even with the moneys available to him, he did not implement all the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  A total of 57,000 social welfare recipients on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare are still below the figure recommended by the commission 12 years ago. How can the Minister clap himself on the back when he was not able to implement those recommendations? When confronted with such facts, he should hang his head in shame and renew the battle he is alleged to have had with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has been spending too much time trying to snatch money from people saving with credit unions rather than directing his attention to those in need.  The Minister for Social Welfare's heart may be in the right place, but he has failed to reach the stony heart <Col N="1264" /> of the Minister for Finance.  If that is the case he should come clean to the House and we will back him in renewing his efforts in that regard.  He should not under any circumstances tell us the Social Welfare Bill will close the gap between the rich and the poor in our society.  It is obvious it will do the opposite.</P>
    <P>I must, however, give credit where it is due.  I approve of the change regarding the family income supplement, but it does not go far enough.  It follows on the approach adopted by the rainbow Government in removing PRSI from the assessment for FIS.  I am pleased the Minister proposes to calculate FIS net of tax, but the job is not finished because the self-employed are not included.  When we talk about the self-employed a number of images come to mind.  There is the famous golden circle associated with previous Fianna Fáil Administrations and those who availed of the NIB-promoted schemes.  I am not talking about people in those categories.  I am not even talking exclusively about the traditional self-employed person in the corner shop or the small farmer.  I am talking about an era when the main route back to work is through self-employment. The area based allowance scheme has been a great success in that regard.  In future more less well off people will try to eke out a living through self-employment rather than through the PAYE system and they should be supported through the family income supplement.  There should be no discrimination in this area.  They should not be discouraged from taking up self-employment. The Minister should communicate with the Minister for Finance in that regard today.  An extension of the family income supplement would be a significant improvement to the Bill.</P>
    <P>A decent Social Welfare Bill should include adequate increases, proper vision and an approach that simplifies and streamlines the system. The Bill is a failure in that respect.  There are still three different rates of child dependant allowance.  If one is a child of a widower on social welfare, one is worth £17 per week, if one is a child of an old age pensioner or a person on invalidity pension, one is worth £15.20 per week and if one is a child of a person on unemployment assistance or disability benefit, one is worth only £13.20 per week.  There should be no discrimination in this area.  The figures should be increased to at least the top rate.  There has been no attempt to streamline the many different rates of PRSI or to remove the poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have an appreciation of what the objectives of a Department of State which spends approximately £5,000 million a year should be.  They should include a smooth path from welfare to work, equality of opportunity for all and reform of the system to reshape it for the challenges of today and tomorrow.  The Bill fails on all those fronts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two specific inequities in the Bill.  I made a strong plea for carers before the budget and the Carers' Association hoped some action would be taken.  From that point of view <Col N="1265" /> the budget has been a disaster.  Carers are the unsung heroes of society.  Approximately 30,000 of them provide full time in-home care for their loved ones with no time off for holidays or sickness. They work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but are not entitled to any benefits.  They have a legitimate entitlement to and expected, following their discussions with the Government, which presumably included the Minister, a reasonable improvement in their situation.  A letter I received from the Carers' Association yesterday stated there was an unprecedented sense of hurt by carers to the proposals concerning them in the budget.  I fully endorse everything they said and I will continue the fight on their behalf.  It is a fair and reasonable fight and will be won.  Carers need to be catered for today, not in the new millennium.  I have proposals in that regard for a £1,000 carer's respite allowance payable, irrespective of means, to all carers with an improvement on a means tested basis.</P>
    <P>A category that has not been catered for properly are widows.  There are approximately 200,000 widowed persons, two thirds of whom are aged 65 or over and only a quarter of whom have sufficient income to be liable to tax.  This is a neglected sector of society and my proposals for improvements for them have not been met.</P>
    <P>Contributory old age pensions to the self-employed will be payable for the first time from 6 April.  However, an injustice is being done to many people who were forced to make a contribution and will not now benefit.  The figure quoted by the Minister of £756 million as the cost of remedying that injustice is utterly wrong. When I raised the issue here he agreed the figure was overstated.  Yet, when I last raised this matter here, somebody from his Department spoke to <i>The Examiner</i> in slighting terms regarding this injustice and asked, in the event of so much money being available, if this was the most deserving group.  I am not talking about deserving cases, I am talking about justice.  These people were forced to make those contributions and should be entitled to payment.  They did not volunteer these contributions, the State demanded and took them and has treated those people disgracefully.</P>
    <P>The figure of £756 million is incorrect and I ask the Minister not to repeat it.  It is the capitalised lifetime cost on some actuarial assumptions which go back ten years.  The Department no longer accepts it and I ask the Minister not to accept it.  I have done some calculations on the cost of remedying this injustice.  <i>Pro rata</i> payments to the contributors &mdash; nine-tenths if one paid for nine years and two-tenths if one paid for two years &mdash; would mean, if we take into account those who will qualify for and are paid non-contributory pensions, that half the people can be excluded on that basis, which is not unreasonable.  It would mean 4,500 equivalent full pension units, the cost of which at today's rates would be of the order of £18.75 million gross.  There would be substantial buoyancy attached to that figure as those payments <Col N="1266" /> are taxable.  The net cost to the Exchequer would be approximately £11.25 per year.  That contrasts with the figure of £756 million floated and touted by the Minister, as if the job of remedying this injustice was impossible.  It is not impossible and I am prepared to argue these figures with the Minister, bearing in mind that the annual pension bill of the State is over £1 billion. The figure of £11.25 million is about 1 per cent of the overall bill.  It should be paid not because people deserve it on means grounds but because they are entitled to it in justice, having paid for it.  I urge the Minister to confront that issue.</P>
    <P>A new provision in the Bill provides for the administration of public service data in sections 14 and 15.  I support the measures provided for in that there is a need for safeguards in this new system.  However, those safeguards should be under Oireachtas control and not under the control of the Minister.  We need to improve the system but we must be careful when entering this new territory that Big Brother, who is watching over people, has control of the elected parliament of the people rather than the Minister.  Queries have been raised about the introduction of the personal public service number.  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed has made a good case on the issue, of not totally opposing it but has raised legitimate queries.  I have discussed it with them and I firmly believe the points raised must be considered.  I would prefer to have them considered in a separate Bill.  To rush it through in the context of the broad picture of social welfare limits us in what we can say.  The question of allowing the Minister to add additional information to the card, without recourse to primary legislation, deserves consideration. The accuracy of the information being retained and to whom it will be made available needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Data Protection Commissioner who had voiced some concerns in this area and probably had an input to the Bill.  His response to the matter is measured but he raised the advantages and disadvantages of the system.  The advantages are obvious from the point of view of efficiency but there are some difficulties with a system, with a common file reference number, that has a capacity to bring together files which are compiled for totally different purposes.  That raises issues which need to be considered.  There is also the question of the conditions under which State agencies will be permitted to share information.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the wide definition, in section 14, of &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; which seems to cater for virtually everything from an application for a television licence to a water grant or a birth certificate.  I am not sure whether that is the intention.  I question whether the definition of &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; which relates also to public funds is too loose.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a better level of services and people in receipt of social welfare are entitled to the same sophistication as anybody else from <Col N="1267" /> the point of view of the delivery of those services. Computerisation has huge advantages in terms of speed of service and so on but serious issues have not been fully debated and teased out.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to Committee Stage it would be useful to hear from the INOU, who has prepared a paper on this issue, and the Data Protection Commissioner so that members of the committee may raise questions, some quite technical, with the representatives of the INOU and the Data Protection Commissioner.  Members would then be much better informed and in a position to deal with this proposal in a measured way.  It would be wrong to give an irrational and emotional response.  We have a duty, as legislators, to tease out the implications.  We all want a better system put in place and have advocated the introduction of a single means test.  This is another way of achieving that objective.  At the same time, none of us wants to see Big Brother moving into pole position.  That would be a catastrophe of Orwellian proportions.  I have discussed my proposal with the chairman of the committee, Deputy Noel Ahern, and he is agreeable.  It is the best way to deal with this radical new approach. While there are benefits, there are also attendant dangers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a huge disappointment and something in which the Government can take no pride because of the way it treats the poor and disadvantaged in society.  Fianna Fáil indicated before the election that it would make an all out assault on disadvantage but this Bill does the contrary. The Government should be ashamed of it.  I and other members of the Opposition will continue to exert pressure to ensure the poverty gaps which have been widened by the Government are closed in the relatively short time the Government will be in office.</P>

      <P>The Bill is an attempt to ensure the marginalised are kept on the margins of society.  It is proposed to introduce the public service card for social welfare claimants to facilitate sharing information on a claimant's record among a series of Departments and such other persons as may be prescribed.  Regardless of the Minister's assurances, I still have concerns. The Bill provides for sharing information with the Garda Síochána.  For what purpose?  The provisions of the Bill are far too loose.</P>
      <P>While fraud at any level is unacceptable, it is grossly unfair and unjust that social welfare claimants are being singled out and will be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny.  This is in stark contrast with the Government's decision not to actively pursue information on the millions of pounds invested in the Ansbacher accounts to evade tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, then Minister for Social Welfare, proposed the introduction of identity cards in 1992, <Col N="1268" /> the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney was very critical of him.  She said the measure could be more appropriately applied to significant commercial activities such as stock market transactions and bank accounts.  She appears to have forgotten her policy. Were the proposals in this Bill and in the Finance Bill relating to the taxation of credit union accounts discussed at the same time?  Does the Tánaiste have an opinion to offer on any subject?</P>
    <P>This is an all or nothing law.  If the public service card is introduced, everybody should have one.  More importantly, the concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner should be taken into account.  The commissioner, who is well versed on the implications of this proposal, has recommended that a White Paper on sharing information be published.  He stated in his annual report for 1996 that, &ldquo;information collected for one purpose should not be used for another without the consent of the individual&rdquo;.  The Minister has chosen to ignore this advice.</P>
    <P>The implications of this proposal should be the subject of a more extensive debate in this House. It merits the introduction of a separate Bill.  It will require a massive investment in computer facilities across a range of Departments.  We have been informed that certain provisions of the 1997 Social Welfare Act cannot be implemented because of inadequate computer facilities.  If it is possible to introduce the public service card, why is the introduction of the sickness allowance provided for by the previous Government and which everyone supports being put on hold?</P>
    <P>The Minister has also opted to delay until October the introduction of changes in the method of calculation of family income supplement. If the Government is still in office, the social welfare budget for 1999 will be announced the previous month.  I do not know why it bothered to announce the budget for 1998 before Christmas.  People will probably receive their 1998 and 1999 payments at the same time.  The Minister for Finance insisted that the massive concession in capital gains tax for the super rich should become effective on the day following the budget.  I propose that all social welfare increases should also become effective from that date.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Partnership 2000 for the calculation of FIS on net rather than gross income as a means of increasing the take-up and to simplify the method of calculation for claimants.  The delay in introducing the changes is further evidence that the Government is promoting policies that favour the rich at the expense of the poorest in society.  The changes should be introduced at the latest at the commencement of the new tax year in April to enable the hundreds of workers in my constituency who take up seasonal employment in the tourism industry to benefit.  I urge the Minister to think again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to move sufficiently on the punitive means test for the carer's allowance. Ideally, the sick, the elderly and the disabled should be cared for at home.  However, many people are being forced to live in homes and institutions <Col N="1269" /> which cater for their special needs.  It is not financially viable for their families or relatives to take on the role of carer.  The carer's allowance should be reviewed.  There is also a need to put a system in place to enable carers to take a two week holiday each year.  I was surprised that many of the women in the houses I canvassed in a rural area in Tipperary yesterday were either working or out walking.  I met three women who told me the only reason they were at home was that they were minding elderly people.  That is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week job.  I ask the Minister to initiate a measure to allow carers to take a break, perhaps three out of the 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>One of the most welcome aspects of the Bill in relations to carers was the extension of the free travel pass to recipients of the allowance, but the implementation date for the introduction of that measure is October.  Once again the Government has decided to make whatever budgetary savings it can on the backs of the poorest people.  The Minister met representatives of the Carers' Association prior to the announcement of the budget and the publication of this Bill.  They lobbied him to seek an easing of the punitive means test, but their representations fell on deaf ears.  I intend to table amendments on the provision for carers on Committee Stage next week because that provision affects mainly women and people who have been forgotten.  I presume the Minister will tell me it will cost a good deal of money to implement what I propose.  I ask him to discuss this matter with his colleague in the Department of Health and Children who has responsibility for the provision of long-term institutional care for the aged and infirm.  The cost of care on the Department of Health and Children is great.  In addition there is a shortage of institutional accommodation in many areas.  A realistic assessment of means testing for the carer's allowance would have a great impact on the numbers who would be cared for in their homes and it would free up places in institutions that are completely overcrowded.  There is a good deal of debate on that at present and those who are canvassing in the Dublin North by-election will know St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane is a major issue.  If the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children co-operated they could devise a system to free up places in those institutions and keep those people at home where they should be.</P>
    <P>The Government has applauded itself for increasing welfare payments to the adequacy rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare as it was obliged to do under Partnership 2000.  However, in this Bill the Minister failed to carry out the Government's commitments in the national agreement by not increasing the short-term rate sufficiently to bring it over the minimum adequacy level.  He has also failed to do that in the case of the basic supplementary allowance payment.  He went so far as to give it with one hand and to take it away with the other.  The increase in the full rate of social welfare benefit <Col N="1270" /> is offset by the knifing tactic of reducing the rate of adult dependant allowance or the qualified adult rate &mdash; I am confused with the new names of schemes and Departments.  It is almost custom and practice at this stage for the adult dependant rate to be increased by 6 per cent of the personal rate.  This year the increase has been reduced to 5.8 per cent, which in cash terms means that the adult dependant will receive £1.20 per week less than expected.  That is quite a loss for those who are on a very low income.  This move is antiwomen and anti-children.</P>
    <P>In most cases the adult dependant rate is a payment which applies to the female spouse.  Women are generally the managers of poverty in the home.  They must stretch out inadequate social welfare benefits to cover the cost of putting food on the table, clothing their families, paying the bills and keeping their children at school.  The failure of the Minister to increase the adult dependant rate in line with the normal rate is an insult to those women.</P>
    <P>Under the previous Government an important document entitled National Anti-Poverty Strategy was drawn up following a wide consultation process involving a number of pressure groups and experts.  That document was published in April, but since this Administration has taken over, its recommendations appear to have been shelved.  The National Anti-Poverty Strategy committed the Government to poverty proofing the budget before it was announced.  The Minister ignored his obligation under the NAPS when he gave adult dependants a lower rate that they would normally get.</P>
    <P>I also regret that the Minister did not take the opportunity to rationalise arrangements for child dependant allowances for grown up children.  The present rules are a maze.  The age at which child dependant allowances cease depends on the payment involved.  The rules should be rationalised and applied in the same way in respect of all payments. Recipients of unemployment benefit and disability benefit are not entitled to child dependant allowance because they are short-term payments. The Minister and I know the cost of keeping a child at school, particularly at third level, is extremely expensive, especially if one is from south Kerry.  Students have to leave home on Sunday evening and return perhaps once every three or four weeks.  To punish those who are on short-term disability benefit and unemployment benefit by not allocating them child dependant allowance is another burden on those people.  I say that in the knowledge that child dependant payments are gradually withering away.  That is the correct strategy provided child benefit is increased to take account of that.  Even while child dependant payments are withering away they should be applied equitably and I ask the Minister to take this opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is payable up to the age of 16 or 19 if the child is in full-time education.  After that there is no support, even though many of those young adults are financially dependent on their <Col N="1271" /> parents.  The opportunity should be taken this year to raise the qualifying age for a child dependant where dependants are still in full-time education.  I was also disappointed with the increase in child benefit payments in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government has defended the December budget in the name of old age pensioners.  An increase of £5 per week in the full rate was welcome, but the increase of £1.50 in the dependant rate takes the good out of that increase.  Effectively for a couple dependent on the old age pension, the net gain under the budget was £3.25, which leaves a good deal less than the £5 increase we read about in the papers in the pockets of old age pensioners.  The Government cannot continue to blow its trumpet about the increase in old age pensions by acting selectively when giving examples of the impact of budgetary measures.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the provision for the review of the social insurance scheme in the Bill. What is outlined here is something the Minister should undertake on an ongoing basis as part of normal management.  The social insurance system is not funded in the normal way insurance is generally funded.  Is it the Minister's intention to turn it into such a fund and, if so, is it his intention that the benefits to be paid out should be determined by the condition of that fund?  That would involve a major change to social insurance as we know it.  It is also very worrying.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on his intentions in this matter.  I am concerned he has taken on board some of the PD rhetoric from the last election campaign when the Progressive Democrats wanted to end the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>When social insurance was introduced for the self-employed in 1988 there was a provision for a review of the adequacy of the self-employed contribution to meet the benefits within five years. What happened about that?  Was the review undertaken and, if so, what were the findings? This is an important issue because this year will see the first old age pensioner to benefit from that scheme.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the matter, to state whether he has the results and if he will publish them.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the Bill's failure to build on the work of the last Government in the field of welfare to work.  The Bill presents us with little which will increase the movement of people off the live register and into employment.  The new tax allowance for the long-term unemployed who are moving into employment is a far more favourable option for employers than the back to work allowance.  From the available information the back-to-work allowance has proven to be a success in moving long-term unemployed people into work, particularly into self-employment.  Instead of building on the success of this scheme, the Government has issued a new scheme which will make welfare to work options more confusing. Many of the unemployed are confused by the schemes.  They should be rationalised.  The back-to-work <Col N="1272" /> allowance has been in operation for some time and we should shortly have evidence of the numbers who have been sustained in employment following the completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of income supports for those who set themselves up in self-employment and either have exhausted their entitlement to the back-to-work allowance or have no entitlement to it.  On this basis, I ask the Minister to extend FIS eligibility to self-employment where income support is required.  I am a member of my county's enterprise board; we meet many young people with great ideas but they are afraid to take the plunge, particularly if they have a family, because the first two or three years of any business are extremely difficult.  The Minister should extend the FIS for the first three years to support people trying to start a business.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party committed itself to examine income support and pension entitlements for women in the home but he has neglected to include plans for such an examination in the Bill. Will he forget all about it?  Perhaps he would elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>As I said in my contribution on the Finance Bill, the assessment of capital for contributory old age pensions is out of line.  The rate of assessment is not the rate of interest which those people are receiving.  The Minister should re-examine this because we do not want old people to return to putting money under the bed.  Interest rates are decreasing and I hope they will do so for some time but the assessment of capital has not changed for some time.</P>
    <P>There are many other glaring examples in the Bill where the Minister has neglected commitments made while in Opposition.  On all Stages I will seek substantial amendments to ensure we get a more progressive, less punitive and more equitable social welfare system.  Neither my Labour Party colleagues nor I will offer support to the Minister in his efforts to have the Bill passed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin was incorrect to say the personal public service card will be used by the Garda against those who hold it.  The Minister specifically stated that it may not be used as an identity card for Garda purposes and that the number may only be sought by the public service when there is a financial transaction between the holder and public service.  I would not like it to go out from this House that the personal public service card can or will be used by the Garda and if there is any doubt on the matter I would expect the select committee to ensure that is the case.</P>

      <P>The late Éamon de Valera's athletic youths and comely maidens, who danced at <Col N="1273" /> the crossroads, are now frequently found dancing in the many community centres and parish halls around the country.  The young boys and girls of 1943 are the senior citizens of 1998.  Life is easier, trips are organised, &ldquo;golden years&rdquo; holidays are available in hotels, day care centres provide meals, medical care and hairdressing, and voluntary groups provide meals on wheels almost nationwide.  Active retirement groups are thriving in parishes and communities.  Senior citizens are coming into sporting facilities such as indoor bowling and table tennis &mdash; many of them were not previously involved in any form of sport.</P>
      <P>It is a golden era for our senior citizens and things are getting better.  In the Social Welfare Bill the Minister, Deputy Ahern, has given a special &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; increase of £5 per week to people receiving old age pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, and retirement pensions. The same increase is being given to people over 66 in receipt of widow's and widower's pensions, blind person's pension or carer's allowance, and to people over 65 in receipt of invalidity pension. This is a significant increase which is recognised and appreciated not only by its recipients but also by the children and grandchildren of the elderly.  I have no doubt the level of popularity maintained in the polls by Fianna Fáil is due in no small measure to this generous increase.</P>
      <P>During 1998 inflation is expected to be 2 per cent.  An extra £5 per week represents an increase of between 6.4 and 7.4 per cent, which is hefty in anyone's book.  Not only that, the payment will be made earlier than it was in 1997 &mdash; it will be made in the first week in June.</P>
      <P>Whether it will be in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, everyone in the House will eventually look for comfortable nursing homes, as will our constituents. For the benefit of all we should encourage the co-operative building of nursing homes in every parish so that people can be cared for conveniently and near to their families.  Complementing the £5 per week increase in the Social Welfare Bill, the Finance Bill gives capital allowances for building nursing homes.  In Templeogue, where I live, the age profile of the population is increasing all the time and there is both the desire and the will to get together with the responsible institutions to build a nursing home, so that people can stay in the parish where they have been all their lives.  The capital allowances should help in that regard.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 guarantees the protection and enhancement of income of those on social welfare and Fianna Fáil is committed to this.  We are determined that social welfare payments will at least equal the minimum rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare by the end of 1999.  In that regard, some 94 per cent of social welfare recipients currently receive a level greater than the commission's minimum recommended rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to pensions, it is opportune to examine the findings of the actuarial review on the cost of social welfare pensions into the next millennium, published last September by the Minister.  It estimates <Col N="1274" /> that the number of persons aged over 65 will increase from more than 400,000 at present to about 700,000 in 2026.  That number is expected to increase to in excess of one million persons over 65 years in 2056.  However, the total population is expected to remain fairly static.  At present, five working people support each person over 65 years of age; it is projected that in 2056 only two working people will support each person over 65 years of age.  We must ask whether we can continue to provide pensions at their present level from the PRSI contributions of the working population.</P>
    <P>The review forecasts that if pensions increase in line with prices the position will be manageable. Fianna Fáil is committed to linking increases in old age pensions to increases in the current rates of public service pay.  It is very important to keep the living standards and quality of life of our senior citizens in line with those of the rest of the population.  If pensions are to be increased in line with earnings, which everyone would prefer, it is estimated that in constant 1997 prices £3.2 billion would be needed in addition to workers' PRSI contributions in 2026, increasing to a need for an additional £10.4 billion in 2056.</P>
    <P>The review suggests that while the funding position is reasonably stable for the next 20 years, the position thereafter cannot be ignored.  I am pleased that in section 16 the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has set up an investment account within the social insurance fund.  It is necessary that substantial contributions are made to this investment account over the next 30 years, so that the living standards of our older people are maintained without imposing an unsustainable cost on future generations.  It is farseeing of the Minister to ensure actuarial reviews will be carried out at least every five years to find out the level of need and how adequate the purse is to maintain the living standards to which our elderly people are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the introduction of the personal public service card.  The last Government promised throughout its term in office to promote and progress its introduction.  I am very surprised by the Labour Party's U-turn. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin suggested that Labour is totally against such a card at this point.  It is a quare thing that one's mind can be totally turned in eight months.</P>
    <P>For too long the agencies of the State which provide services have operated in an isolated manner to the detriment of their clients.  As each speaker has said, it should be possible for one means test to be carried out to determine one's entitlement to the various social services administered by State agencies.  These services include the supplementary welfare allowance, medical cards, the differential rents operated by local authorities, higher education grants, entitlement to free legal aid and the many social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages sharing information between the specified public service agencies which deliver <Col N="1275" /> the public funded income support services.  I am somewhat concerned by the provision whereby data controllers have to approve this sharing of information.  Since entering this House, I have become somewhat wary of the powers of the data commissioner to stop progress in its tracks.  The examination of data will be a time consuming task for the data controllers and will create long delays.</P>
    <P>The administration of public service data should be operated in an open manner by the civil servants of the various agencies.  We are indebted to the Civil Service.  All Members have high regard for the integrity and honesty of our civil servants.  They can act in a confidential manner which will respect the privacy of the clients and ensure the security of the information contained in the general public service data bank.</P>
    <P>The new personal public service card system will involve new ways of thinking among civil servants. Their training should include, to a very great extent, training on the ethics applicable to the information aspect of the job.  This would take into account matters of confidentiality, privacy and security.  I am sure that, with the professionalism of our civil servants and appropriate sanctions under the Official Secrets Act, the administration of public service data would be more effectively and efficiently performed, without the need for a delay creating control mechanism.  I ask the Minister and the committee to consider that.  I accept there is a need for a unified means test.  The personal public service card will lend itself to the development of this.</P>
    <P>I am sure some people will feel that further freedoms are being trodden on.  However, we live in an era of rapid information availability.  Open, transparent and fast transmission of information leads to a more effective and efficient way of getting things done.  This efficiency translates into greater productivity, which increases wealth, and increased wealth improves the people's standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed in An Action Programme for the Millennium to protecting the family through political, social and other measures which will support the family's stability. It is committed to maintaining the tradition of the family in Ireland, which is one of our strongest national characteristics.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has made some headway to improve the lot of the family.  Late last year he brought into effect legislation allowing partners of social welfare claimants tapered relief on earnings, from £60 to £90 per week, without losing all of the adult dependant allowances.  This was a start in the assistance to the family.</P>
    <P>The most significant improvement in the position of the family is the improvement in family income supplement.  The Bill provides that, with effect from 1 October 1998, the rate of family income supplement payable will be calculated on the basis of net earnings, that is, earnings after taking into account PRSI, income tax and pension <Col N="1276" /> contributions.  This was recognised as one of the major poverty traps which prevented people from taking up employment.  The report of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare systems referred specifically to the benefits of using net rather than gross earnings to calculate family income supplement.  I am delighted the Minister has taken this very important initiative.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also provided for a general increase of £7 per week in the threshold for the calculation of entitlement to family income supplement from June 1998.  Together with the taxation incentives in the Finance Bill, I am sure this measure will have a significant impact on reducing the number of long-term unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he will publish the final report of the commission on the family in 1998.  I hope recommendations will be made relating to pensions for homemakers in their own right, as mentioned by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin; the need to give some tax relief to married people in recognition of their staying at home to care for their children; and that the rates of benefits and assistance for each qualified child should be increased from the present £13.20 per week to the maximum level which is now available to people receiving widow's and widower's pensions, which is £17 per week.</P>
    <P>I have been making representations for some considerable time for increases in child benefit payments to families with twins.  I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, got the child benefit for twins increased to 150 per cent of the normal child benefit.  That will come into effect from September 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his budget speech he will establish a community trust to bring business funding and know how to support community development.  Community based local development groups, partnerships and task forces are worthwhile and are doing a good job, but significant business know-how and funding are missing. The involvement of business interests in a meaningful way would give an added impetus in increasing employment and in minimising the effects of social exclusion which is suffered by so many in the inner city and in other deprived urban areas.  I urge the Minister and the major industries and business organisations to take urgent action on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, together with the Finance Bill, will make significant inroads into improving the living standards of all the people. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister has to leave shortly for another appointment and I thank him for informing me of that fact.  Before he goes, let me congratulate him on bringing in his first Bill. However, I am not very impressed by it.  I do not suppose the Minister expected me to say otherwise, but I do not say so in any mean-spirited way.  I simply regard it as an inadequate response <Col N="1277" /> to the problems faced by hundreds of thousands of people.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the 1998 Bill is one of the most radical Social Welfare Bills presented to the Oireachtas in many years.  However, that depends on one's definition of radical.  If one were to take the view that a nominal £5 increase for pensioners is the most radical thing that has happened in many years, that claim would be accurate. However, I do not take such a narrow view of the notion of radicalism.  I would simply draw attention to the things the Minister claims are radical. He says the Bill provides for substantial real increases in the value of all social welfare payments. There is nothing very radical about that &mdash; it is good, but it is not radical.  He said the Bill significantly improves payments for pensioners. Again, this is good, but it is not a new direction in any sense.  That has been happening for some time.  The Bill brings forward increases in weekly payments by two weeks.  Again, this is a good move, but it is not significant enough to be defined as radical.  That step was introduced by the last Administration to try to close the gap between the date on which tax changes take place in April and the date on which social welfare increases are implemented.  It is good that the date has been brought back another two weeks, but it is not a new direction.  Fundamental reform of family income supplement was begun some time ago.  There is additional support for families, special child benefit payments for twins and improved grants in respect of multiple births, all of which have been done before.  There is an easing of the means test for certain social assistance schemes; a firm basis for developing a more integrated administration of our public services, again based on the ISSS report; relief to more than one million workers paying PRSI, again an initiative developed by the last Administration; and strengthening of the PRSI system with regular actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund &mdash; again, the first actuarial review was carried out by the last Administration.  I welcome the fact that a five-yearly actuarial review is included in legislation, because it cannot be dropped unnecessarily or without coming back into this House. However, none of that sustains the claim that this is the most radical Bill introduced in this House for many years.  It simply is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To satisfy myself that I was not being unfair to the Minister, I went back to An Action Programme for the Millennium, produced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats as their programme for Government, to find out whether there was any reference to social exclusion, poverty, deprivation and disadvantage, or to any policy to deal with those, and whether this was what the Minister was measuring himself against.  If this is the document against which he is measuring himself in the context of this being a radical Bill, then what he has produced is a radical Bill, because there is nothing in this programme which seeks to address the issues of deprivation in a significant or in a concerted way.  It is striking that <Col N="1278" /> the only reference to economic deprivation, educational disadvantage and social exclusion is under the heading &ldquo;Crime&rdquo;.  They are not issues that are brought forward in this Government's programme in terms of dealing with them as issues which relate to the quality of life of the person affected by deprivation.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to press the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in this House on whether the most recent budget would be audited and measured against the targets in the national anti-poverty strategy, and all I got in response was fudge.  The nearest I got to a commitment from the Taoiseach was his assertion that progress would be measured against economic performance.  That is not what I was asking about.  I was asking specifically whether the changes being made would be measured against the targets in the national anti-poverty strategy.  It seems there is no commitment to do that.  I hope I am wrong, and I hope the absence of a policy framework in the Minister's speech today is simply a desire to concentrate exclusively on the detail of the Bill and not an indication of an absence of any policy framework. If we are serious about ensuring that the Celtic tiger delivers a good standard of living and quality of life to all our citizens, the Government of the day and its agencies have to co-ordinate their efforts to ensure that disadvantage, social exclusion and poverty are eliminated.</P>
    <P>The only place I could find reference in the Government's programme to the idea of auditing or proofing was, interestingly, in relation to rural development.  In a sense that is not surprising, because the rural ethos dominates the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not suggesting that what is in here is not a good thing, but it seems there is a blind spot in Fianna Fáil thinking when it comes to urban poverty.  That is surprising because there are significant numbers of Fianna Fáil TDs representing areas where there is urban poverty.  There seems to be a blind spot in terms of developing Fianna Fáil's general approach to the issues which are exercising the minds of the population at large.  For some reason or other we get a hotchpotch of sticking plaster approaches to issues of poverty in urban areas, while in the Government programme it is stated that key priorities will include a positive plan to ensure that rural population stabilisation will be embarked upon and that all policies, fiscal, social and educational, will be proofed to ensure they do not discriminate against rural areas.  That is the only reference to proofing in the programme for Government.  Has this proposal been implemented and, if so, what mechanism was put in place to implement it?  I agree with the objective but it is an inadequate response to the endemic poverty in many rural areas and to the more serious issues of urban deprivation and poverty which are concentrated to a significant extent in particular geographical areas.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the policy outlined in the programme for Government is so weak.  The publication <Col N="1279" /> issued by the Combat Poverty Agency in l996 contains a detailed analysis of the causes of rural poverty and outlines a programme of action and policies which should be introduced to deal with it.  There is no reference to this idea in the Minister's speech, the Social Welfare Bill or the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill with which I fundamentally disagree.  However, some areas need to be tightened up.  The public services card is a good idea but the checks and balances necessary to protect the privacy of citizens need to be addressed in a more coherent way.  The INOU has said that the issue is of such importance that it should be dealt with in a separate Bill, not the Social Welfare Bill.  It is not opposed to the introduction of the card.  Like everyone else, it is anxious that people who need to be means tested from time to time do not have to go through a series of means test, for example, a means test for unemployment assistance today, a means test for a medical card tomorrow and a means test for differential rent next week.  It makes sense and would save money to have a standardised test in so far as this is possible.  I have looked at this and, while there are difficulties, it should be possible for a public services card to contain information which would reduce considerably the number of forms which have to be filled by a person seeking social services of various kinds.  While there is nothing in the Bill with which I fundamentally disagree, it is inadequate in terms of the claim that it is radical and of what needs to be done with the available resources.</P>
    <P>One of the most important actions of the previous Administration was to agree the national anti-poverty strategy.  I am proud of the role I played in developing this strategy and am also proud that Labour and Fine Gael saw the need for it and supported it.  Inevitably there were discussions and debates about what the targets should be.  However, these are not extraordinarily ambitious.  What is important about the strategy is that it is the first time a Government acknowledged there was a serious problem of deprivation and poverty which needed to be dealt with and that, regardless of how well it was doing, the economy on its own would not lift those in abject and persistent poverty out of it and mechanisms had to be put in place to do this.  The national anti-poverty strategy attempts to do this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs have given rhetorical commitments in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy and social exclusion but there is no evidence that the Government will take the strategy on board as a matter of urgency. If the strategy is to succeed it needs to be driven, but there is no evidence that this will be done. Departments and agencies tend, by their nature, to approach these matters in a conservative way and are not adventurous.  Unless a political agency at the top drives the strategy it will not be <Col N="1280" /> effective.  In addition, other powers and interests will press for other approaches.</P>
    <P>The budget is an example of how the rhetorical commitment to the national anti-poverty strategy has been undercut.  The budget gave tax cuts to those on the top end of the income scale when the clear demand and need under the national anti-poverty strategy is to give tax cuts to those on low pay to ensure they do not fall into the tax net and that poverty traps are eliminated.  It is ridiculous that a single person earning £80 per week has to pay tax.</P>
    <P>At a time when the national anti-poverty strategy is in place, a unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is doing its best to co-ordinate the response of various Departments to it and a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the Taoiseach is looking at the matter, it is ridiculous that the Minister for Finance, in contravention of everything the Combat Poverty Agency argued for in advance of the budget and the proposals in strategy, introduced a budget which benefited the better off.  If the Government is not serious about the national anti-poverty strategy &mdash; and the budget indicates it is not &mdash; then it should stop saying it is committed to it and drop it.  It should not pretend it will do something if it will not do it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing his first Bill and I hope it is the first of many because there are a number of issues of social exclusion, marginalisation and poverty in the community which must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much good news in the Bill and Deputies from all sides have to admit that.  It might be expected that I would not say anything else.  However, the Minister in his speech spoke of the £5 increase which he has provided for old age pensioners, which is well above the expected rate of inflation, moving towards a pension of £100 per week in the year 2002.  He also made the <Col N="1281" /> point that 93 per cent of all payments are above the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact, to which Deputy De Rossa referred, that the date on which the increased payments will be introduced is being brought forward by two weeks to 1 June.  The Minister has often spoken about the need to bring that date forward towards the start of the tax year and we all look forward to that.</P>
    <P>One of the major lobbying points over the past number of years relates to the carer's allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has increased the carer's allowance by £5 for carers aged 66 and over, and by £3 for carers younger than 66.  All carers who receive the carer's allowance will receive a free travel pass in their own right.</P>
      <P>Many people have lobbied on this matter.  The Carers Association is particularly looking for changes in the means test for carers similar to those the Minister proposed for family income supplement.  It also wants an increase in the amount of income which is disregarded, which is £150 per week at present.</P>
      <P>The association has also lobbied for a change in the 24 hour care rule, which is very difficult.  In his speech the Minister has shown some flexibility in this regard and I welcome that.  However, the Carers Association lobby will continue to be very strong.</P>
      <P>I, and other Deputies, lobbied in the past to abolish the means test for the carer's allowance and I was told by officials of the Department that it would cost in the region of £120 million.  We should point out that it is not just about looking after elderly people.  There is the sad circumstance of children and young adults who are suffering mental or physical handicap who also need care.  It is very difficult for carers if they lose out on this allowance over a strict means test.  I hope the Minister will go further and disregard more income in the case of the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the extra support for smallholders in relation to means test assessment and the further improvements under the rural environmental protection scheme.  The REPS is a popular scheme and the first £2,000 of the REPS payment has been disregarded for means test purposes. The Bill provides for an extension of this disregard of income to the new compensation scheme for the areas of conservation, which is operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  I am glad that under these revised arrangements the first £2,000 will continue to be disregarded with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent rather than on a pound for pound basis as at present.  This means, for <Col N="1282" /> example, that a farmer who receives a REPS payment of £4,000 will be £1,000 better off now.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention this famous pound for pound basis because it is the bane of our lives in rural areas that smallholders with a small income are penalised.  There was an example of this in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>, my local newspaper, last week where a farmer's unemployment smallholder's assistance was reduced by £3 pounds per week because he purchased a cow.</P>
    <P>I welcome these measures to help people either on the REPS or on the scheme run by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It not only helps the low income farmers but also the environment by improving the sustainability of agriculture through the preservation and enhancement of the rural environment.  I strongly support the initiative taken by the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>One of the major complaints I have in regard to social welfare generally concerns delays in the appeals system, in particular oral hearings.  I hope this problem can be addressed.  People like to have an oral hearing because they can make their case across the table to a social welfare appeals officer, but the delays involved in this procedure are disappointing.  The main reason for the delays is that there are so many social welfare schemes in operation as well as various means tested schemes.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a particular problem with regard to social welfare in that when cattle headage, suckler cow and beef premia grants are paid, notional figures have to be taken into account because these payments are made in instalments. Unfortunately farmers may be assessed on all grant payments even though they may not have been received in a particular calendar year.  That issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>A different system operates in regard to assessment for a medical card and another one for higher education grants.  I ask the Minister to respond by ensuring that fair means tests are carried out.  If there are figures with which an applicant does not agree, the matter should be rectified promptly rather than the person completing another application form and going through the appeals procedure, thereby incurring further delays.</P>
    <P>This debate gives me an opportunity to talk about how the Department could co-ordinate many of the schemes that operate under various Departments.  I have always been of the view that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs could act as a type of one stop shop when it comes to job opportunity schemes and not simply deal with paying out social welfare money.</P>
    <P>Last November the Minister, Deputy Ahern, made changes in the back to work scheme to ensure that people with disabilities were not denied job opportunities.  The last initiative taken <Col N="1283" /> by the Department resulted in 1,000 places being reserved in the back to work scheme for peoplewith disabilities.  I understand this scheme will now be extended to people receiving a disability allowance or a blind pension.</P>
    <P>The back to work scheme, which was introduced in 1993, has been successful in encouraging over 22,000 unemployed people to take up employment or start a business.  The participants can retain some of their social welfare payment over a period of three years with additional benefits. This scheme, with the return to education scheme, are important and I hope improvements will be made in them.  I hope there will not be any duplication in regard to these and similar schemes operated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS.  I understand FÁS operates an employer incentive scheme which complements the back to work scheme.  One of the problems with many social welfare schemes is the fact that a person must be signing on to qualify for them.  I ask the Minister to examine that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the student summer work scheme operated by the Department, some students do not qualify because they are not signing on.  I would like to see a situation where people who passed the leaving certificate, for example, could qualify to participate in this scheme.  Some flexibility should be shown to families with two or more children wishing to participate in the scheme, similar to the position which obtains in regard to the higher education grant scheme which offers some flexibility to families with two or more children in a third level college.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that a young person can sign on and claim social welfare but cannot participate in the student summer work scheme because of their age or the fact that they are not in college. It must be frustrating for the large number of community groups who try to get students to work on these schemes only to find that not enough of them qualify in a particular parish. That is disappointing.  When a person completes a FÁS scheme operated by a local authority, health board or community group, they should not have to sign on again for six months to take up employment in a different scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of PRSI for self-employed people.  Many small business people, shopkeepers, etc., throughout the country who applied for a contributory pension ten years ago are now one year short of the required number of contributions.  I came across a case where a person was one month short of the required number. There was an understanding in the past that if a person was short of contributions they could either buy the required number, get a proportion of their pension or continue contributing until they had ten years' contributions after the age of 66.  That no longer seems to be the case and it is disappointing for people to be told, having started the scheme nine or ten years ago, that all they can get is a refund of their contributions.  I hope the Minister will examine that matter.  He has <Col N="1284" /> made some improvements in regard to the average number of years needed for the particular pension, and I am aware the Department is also reviewing the whole area, but more progress must be made because it is a matter of major concern to the people affected who thought they would be entitled to benefits under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement on family income supplement which will now be based on net income.  I understand an additional 1,600 families will benefit in 1998, 7,000 people in a full year.  I hope that will extend to schemes operated by other Departments.  Under this scheme there is now an incentive for unemployed people to take up work.  That is something for which the Minister has fought for a long time.  I welcome the fact that he got the additional funding to provide for the welcome improvements in family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Given that unemployment rates are falling, the Minister should provide more funding for social welfare.  Since he referred to savings in social welfare, those savings should be used on the scheme I mentioned.  Last year the unemployment rate fell below 10 per cent for the first time in 20 years.  In November the rate was 9.9 per cent, well below the European average of 11.5 per cent.  For the year to December last, the number of people on the live register fell by 22,426, or 8 per cent. In January 1998 the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment reached its lowest level in seven years, since February 1991, with 241,400 people signing on.  There was a big fall in the number of unemployed in the Dublin region while the position in the western region was not as good.  As Deputies from that region said, given the high unemployment rate in those areas there is need for greater development there.</P>
    <P>Three-quarters of the fall in the number on the live register in the year to October 1997 was accounted for by the progress made in regard to long-term unemployment.  With the fall in unemployment figures the Minister has more money available to him.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is a high spending Department and I hope the Minister uses the money gained on savings to be more flexible with schemes such as the carer's allowance and unemployment assistance.  There are different views on means testing of farmers and assessment of smallholders for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's comments. I hope further legislation will be introduced to deal with social inclusion, marginalisation and poverty.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, who said that this is a <Col N="1285" /> radical Bill.  I wonder was he referring to the 35p per week increase in child benefit, or what aspect of the Bill is radical?  Given that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs made savings of £160 million last year, it is disappointing the Minister did not find it worthwhile to distribute that amount of money to social welfare recipients in 1998.  That is far from radical.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy of long standing in the House, the Chair will be aware that one can almost predict the contributions of Members to Bills such as this, with those on the Government side welcoming the Bill and congratulating the Minister and those on the Opposition side pointing out the difficulties. I will point out a number of anomalies in social welfare payments and other areas that should be changed quickly.  I know the Minister is concerned about the family.  He should be in a position to bring about changes needed to strengthen the family.</P>
      <P>In regard to child dependant allowance, an unemployed person with a child dependant receives £13.20 per week, a person on old age pension or invalidity payment receives £15.20 per week while a widow, widower, lone parent or deserted wife receives £17 per week.  It is not fair that children are treated differently.  I am not suggesting that everybody should receive £13.20, but the allowance should be £17 per week for everybody. It is unthinkable that some people are paid 28 per cent less in child dependant allowance. That is an anomaly that should be corrected.  We will be told there were many more rates over the years and that they have been reduced to three, but it is still an unfair system since all children are not treated equally.</P>
      <P>In regard to adult dependant allowance, an unemployed person receives £40 per week, a person on old age pension receives £51 per week and a person on invalidity pension receives £45.10 per week.  Those inequities should be corrected.  It is unfair that all adult dependants are not treated equally.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly &mdash; I heard much about this matter before Christmas &mdash; is the difference between unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit for people coming off FÁS schemes.  Many people who came off FÁS schemes in the October-November period were disappointed to receive unemployment benefit rather than unemployment assistance.  In certain cases those people missed out on £30 to £40 per week because they did not qualify for the fuel allowance or the Christmas bonus, and those with children in higher education did not receive child dependant allowance.  That results in a substantial reduction in payment on a weekly basis, which is unacceptable.  The Minister should consider that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my hobby-horses relates to family income supplement, a marvellous scheme which is working extremely well.  In many cases it makes the difference between people being prepared to work and staying at home drawing unemployment benefit.  There are, however, difficulties <Col N="1286" /> with the scheme in that it creates poverty traps.  I referred to this matter at the committee last week, but I repeat it because it is important this matter is sorted out.  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance asking what would be the effect of an increase of £10 per week, £20 per week and so on for a family on a gross income of £230 per week with three dependent children.  Because of FIS and marginal tax rates, such a family would need an increase of £40 per week to get an additional £5 take home pay. That is unacceptable.  I thought that if FIS was applied to net pay it would eliminate that poverty trap, but that is not the case.  If that same family received FIS on net pay, an increase of £40 per week would mean an extra £9 per week in take home pay.  I accept that by paying FIS on net pay their total take home pay will increase.  However, taking that starting point, if they are given an increase of £40 they will still only gain £9.  This matter must be co-ordinated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance and that loophole, which is not right or reasonable, should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it will provide many people with additional money.  However, there is a disincentive for employers to pay additional costs.</P>
      <P>FIS should not be administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, it should be administered by the Revenue Commissioners who have access to the returns.  In that way we will guarantee that everyone who is entitled to FIS will qualify for payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill was introduced with great fanfare.  We were led to believe that the underprivileged sections of the community would benefit to a great extent from what was intended to be a &ldquo;fabulous&rdquo; budget and that social welfare benefits were supposed to increase to bring the standard of living of people in disadvantaged sections of society up to par with those of others.  However, it is evident that the substantial real increases in the value of all social welfare payments did not materialise.</P>
      <P>Discrimination exists whereby a dependent relative of a non-contributory pensioner is paid 30p per week less than a dependent relative of a contributory pensioner.  The Social Welfare Bill has created two tiers among the elderly.  It is laid down in the Constitution that everyone should be treated alike.  Instead of penny-pinching, the Minister should rectify the existing anomaly and bring payments in respect of dependants of non-contributory pensioners up to the same standard as those which apply to dependants of contributory pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill provides a special child benefit payment for twins and improved grants for children of multiple births. <Col N="1287" /> That is laudable and it is long overdue.  However, a meagre increase of only 35p per week has been granted in respect of the first child in any family. That is deplorable because it would not be enough to buy a bar of chocolate.  The Minister should also correct this anomaly.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's approach to the entitlement of farmers over 66 years of age to contributory pensions.  On 5 April 1988, these people were compelled to pay PRSI contributions. Some of them have paid contributions for between seven and nine and a half years but they do not qualify for contributory pensions on reaching 66 years of age.  If the Minister understands the seriousness of the situation, it should not be beyond his power to give those farmers an opportunity to pay the necessary contributions to the Department to entitle them to qualify for contributory pensions.  It is an injustice that farmers and self-employed people, such as small shopkeepers, who were compelled to pay social welfare contributions have been beaten by the bell in respect of the ten year qualification period. When a similar scheme was introduced in Great Britain, the then British Minister for Social Welfare gave the people concerned an opportunity to pay the contributions which would entitle them to qualify for contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to review this situation carefully and introduce a system whereby the people involved would be given the opportunity to pay the necessary contributions to allow them to qualify for payment.  It was not their fault that they did not pay contributions before 1988 because it was not made compulsory to do so until that date. I urge the Minister to give them the opportunity to pay the contributions they require to qualify for payment.  Failing that, they should be given the opportunity to continue paying contributions after the age of 66 until they reach the level required for qualification.  They would only have to do so for between one to three years.  Payment would mean a great deal to these people who, having entered the scheme in good faith, have discovered they are not eligible.  They believed their case would be upheld but it has been overlooked by successive Ministers.  I call on the current Minister to rectify that serious anomaly once and for all.</P>
    <P>Even if they are a week late in applying, people who are not aware they qualify for family income supplement and return to work are disallowed payment.  That anomaly should also be rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time and I congratulate them on their contributions. I particularly congratulate Deputy McGrath who served as chairman of the Joint Committee on the Family during the lifetime of the previous Dáil.  That committee discussed many practical issues, a number of which have been taken on board by the Government and its predecessor.  I am sure future Governments will <Col N="1288" /> take further issues on board.  I compliment Deputy McGrath on the great work he did as chairman of the committee.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGrath that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is oriented towards the family.  However, last year the Government saved £127 million in respect of people drawing social welfare who should not have been doing so.  This year's budget increase for social welfare amounts to £125 million so there is no overall increase in social welfare.  I believe 90 per cent of the £127 million to which I referred was taken from small farmers with small holdings.</P>
      <P>I was going to say a great deal about the Social Welfare Bill but I will not do so now because I am disturbed and upset.  People may believe I am being smart or funny, but I cried half an hour ago. Within the past hour, I spoke by telephone to a man at his home.  The sheriff, representatives of the building society and other vultures were present.  The man, his wife and four children were evicted from their house in County Mayo.  The man was carried out and may be charged with assault.  A civilised society should not do business in that fashion.</P>
      <P>I am from County Mayo and I am put in mind of Michael Davitt, the Land League and the problem of evictions in the past.  We are returning to the days of the landlords.  We used to have British landlords but their modern day equivalents are the Irish Nationwide Building Society, AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  There will be a revolution in the years to come.  The Celtic tiger will run out of steam at some time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is in trouble with his constituency colleagues and he should listen to me.  It is not nice to hear a wife and children crying over the telephone while the husband is being carried out of his house.  The landlords in Dublin make these decisions.  When the banks and building societies got into trouble legislation was rushed through this House to help them.  When the PMPA and AIB got into trouble the taxpayers saved them.  I criticise the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but it would never evict people from their houses.  It was disappointing that 13 or 14 people were involved in the eviction of which I have spoken. If those banks and building societies ever get into difficulty I hope legislation will not be rushed through to save them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sheehan's point about farmers who were compelled to pay PRSI in 1988. People should have the opportunity to buy into the scheme or, as the Deputy suggested, to continue paying until they have ten years' contributions. Alternatively, they might be paid <i>pro rata</i> if they do not qualify for a full pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am upset today that a family with four children will have no home tonight.  This is supposed <Col N="1289" /> to be a Christian country in which people are treated fairly.  However, we will need another Michael Davitt to take on the banks and building societies.  There may be bad days ahead for people who borrowed money to buy property at prices they cannot afford and who may not now be able to pay it back.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's selective negative comments on the Bill are overshadowed by the many positive steps taken by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil led Government.  I congratulate the Minister on this excellent Bill.</P>
      <P>The social welfare package in the budget which is being brought into effect with this Bill is one of the largest in the State's history.  It will make a great contribution to improving the circumstances of many people.  The Bill and the budget mark the first step in implementing the commitments given in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill delivers on the Government's commitments in a range of key areas.  It gives a special £5 increase in pensions and this is an important step in achieving an old age pension level of £100 per week to be achieved over the five year life of the Government.  Older people have made a great contribution to the development of the country. Without their sacrifice and hard work we would not have an educated population and a growing economy.  Older people deserve a decent standard of living in their old age and the Government is determined to ensure they get it.  This contrasts with the miserly increases paid over the last three years by the previous rainbow Government. There may be gold at the end of the rainbow but that Government made sure it stayed there.  This Government has put its money where <Col N="1290" /> its mouth is and given a decent £5 per week increase.</P>
    <P>The Government's action programme also guarantees that the Government will honour its commitments in Partnership 2000, including that to bring social welfare rates up to the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1999.  I am glad to learn the increases announced in this Bill mean that 94 per cent of all payments are above the rates recommended by the commission. I am sure the Minister will want to take the final step in next year's Bill and bring all payments above the recommended rates.  This is a major achievement and the Minister deserves credit for what he has achieved in his first few months in office.</P>
    <P>I will highlight the Bill's provisions for people with disabilities and carers.  An Action Programme for the Millennium commits the Government to implement the proposals of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This Bill brings the rates of social welfare payments for people with disabilities above the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and this is a major step towards fulfilling this commitment.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that incentives to take up employment should be available for people with disabilities.  The Minister has taken an important step to this end by increasing the amount which people on disability allowance can earn without affecting their income from £36.20 to £50 per week.  The Minister should consider further increases in this amount in future budgets.</P>
    <P>Carers provide a vital support to the community. Their hard work and dedication is acknowledged by all.  Deputies know from experience that carers put many hours of hard work into their vocation.  I am delighted the Minister is to provide a travel pass for them in their own right.  They are the unsung heroes in the community. They remove a great financial burden from the State by caring for family and friends. The travel pass will allow them a degree of independence and help them to keep in contact with their families and friends.  I am aware the Minister is reviewing the operation of the carer's scheme and I am confident he will put forward significant improvements in future legislation.  His proposals will have my support.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the budget as a whole will do much to improve the position of carers and people with disabilities.  The total package of measures announced in the budget and to be given legal effect with this Bill will provide an extra £17.5 million for them in a full year and £10 million in 1998.  We are anxious to improve their circumstances further.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the measures announced in the budget will guarantee that people will be better off in work than on welfare.  This is as it should be.  In line with the Government's action programme PRSI for those on low pay has been cut. In addition, there has been a great improvement <Col N="1291" /> in family income supplement, probably the most significant since the introduction of the scheme in 1984.  From June the amount of FIS payable will increase by £4 per week and from October FIS will be calculated on the basis of net pay which will result in an average increase of £11 per week. That is a great deal compared to increases in previous years.  This is an example of the Government delivering on commitments in its action programme and Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in payments for twins.  In our election manifesto we promised to increase payments for twins and it is a sign of the Government's commitment to deliver on election promises that it is providing one and a half times child benefit rates for twins or, put another way, three child benefit payments for two children. This will benefit about 12,500 families.  The grants for multiple births are also being improved.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Partnership 2000 states that the development of national level partnership will involve &ldquo;the NESC in consultation with the relevant Government Departments, benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered in the Partnership, both over time and by comparison with other countries.&rdquo; The NESC is concentrating on the identification of indicators and associated data to monitor progress over the course of the programme and locate Ireland relative to its EU and OECD partners.  The work is based on the premise that social inclusion, competitiveness and employment are inextricably linked and that progress on all three should be measured.</P>
      <P>The first stage in this process is the development of a set of indicators to benchmark the elements included in each chapter of the programme. This stage will be discussed by the council at its next meeting in April and I expect a report from it later this year.</P>

However, the competitiveness council <Col N="1292" /> report will be published shortly.  Most of the issues that infringe on benchmarking are also relevant to the competitiveness report.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there are a number of areas, such as abuse of children and homelessness, in respect of which the statistics either do not exist or are out of date and if the NESC relies only on existing statistical sources it may well not be able to benchmark the programme in the most relevant way?  Is he willing to agree that new forms of statistics may need to be collected if we are to benchmark progress adequately?  Has he received representations from the council indicating that particular issues &mdash; hitherto unquantified &mdash; should now be quantified so that this matter can be properly benchmarked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are some of the issues that will be discussed at the April meeting.  The NESC, the House and myself want to operate with the best statistics available.  The Deputy referred to a number of social exclusion issues and it was agreed under the terms of the partnership that the NESF will be carrying out analysis in those areas.  It is the most appropriate pillar of <Col N="1293" /> the partnership programme for such analysis.  In terms of trying to provide the best data, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is the answer.  I am prepared to assist in whatever way I can to make sure the best statistics are used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot analyse unless one has up to date statistics on a range of matters, such as house prices.  We are currently using 1996 house price indicators and everyone knows there has been a huge change in house prices since then.  Does the Taoiseach agree this benchmarking could amount to no more than looking out the back window of a bus rather than being in any way up to date in one's analysis because the statistics themselves must be up to date and comprehensive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always appropriate to update statistics and we will continue to endeavour to do so but there has been a tremendous amount of progress in recent years in this area. In mid-January I received a delegation from the Department of the Environment and Local Government which presented a very good analytical report on the number, size, location and cost of houses built in 1997, as well as an analysis on what is happening in the new house sector in comparison to the second-hand sector by region. There has been a huge improvement in most areas.  I agree it is not of much value to have statutory bodies sending out annual reports 18 months after the year has ended.  I always raise this point and accept it happens.  If annual reports are not published within six months of year end they should be filed in a wastepaper basket.  We have improved the figures in many areas of social partnership, but they are still not satisfactory. There is always room for improvement.</P>

A politically-minded person might have prevented the Minister, Deputy McDaid, from ricocheting from one débacle to another, like a dodgem car driver, as we saw recently on the swimming issue?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, the Government announced the planned changeover to an improved ILO-based presentation of statistics on employment and unemployment.  The new form of presentation was proposed by the Central Statistics Office, endorsed by the Strategy Group on Employment <Col N="1296" /> and Unemployment and followed from recommendations made last May by the National Economic and Social Forum in its report on unemployment statistics.</P>
    <P>The new presentation will give greater prominence to the ILO-based measures of employment and unemployment, which have been included in the CSO's annual labour force survey reports since 1988.  The ILO-based figures are the ones normally used by international agencies for intercountry comparisons.  They provide a very detailed and objective classification of persons by labour force status, from which a range of summary indicators can also be derived.  The traditional national labour force measures, based on the person's subjective assessment of his or her situation, will continue to be published.  The key measure of unemployment is the standardised unemployment rate, which the CSO has published since 1992.  In addition, five other ancillary indicators, will now be published to give supporting information relating to long-term unemployment, persons marginally attached to the labour force, and jobless households.</P>
    <P>The changeover will be linked to the publication of the first results from the quarterly national household survey planned for April.  This survey will be the definitive source of comprehensive sub-annual information on employment and unemployment.  The availability of more frequent survey-based information, including the ancillary indicators, will, in conjunction with the monthly live register and other data sources, improve the overall range of statistics available on the labour market.</P>
    <P>The CSO's monthly main live register statement includes data on those in receipt of pre-retirement allowance.  It also contains statistics on the pre-retirement credits scheme, systematic short-time workers, smallholders and self-employed persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Following the adoption of the new presentation format, and having regard to the greater range of sub-annual data now becoming available, the CSO intends to review its overall presentation of labour market statistics.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with users and will encompass the need for more analyses and also address the coherence of the data from different sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the best way to measure full-time employment is in respect of the number of person hours worked per week?  I did not hear what the Minister of State said about part-time work.  As many people now work on a contract basis, we need an accurate system of measuring part-time work.  Does he accept we need proper statistics on low paid employment, particularly having regard to a recruitment problem that was highlighted on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics do not measure rates of pay.  They merely measure the extent of <Col N="1297" /> employment and unemployment.  There is no proposal to measure the numbers on certain rates of pay.  In regard to part-time work, a perennial problem for successive Governments has been the gap between the labour force survey and the live register &mdash; the live register being consistently higher than the labour force surveys.  One of the reasons is that many of the people interviewed in the survey who may be in part-time employment are allowed to claim on the live register for some payment.  As such, they are included on the live register but do not describe themselves as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that the divergence in data available from the monthly live register statistics and the labour force survey to date has provided a confused figure for Government and has worked against the objective of the Government target areas of high unemployment?  Will the Minister further accept the notion that people counted as unemployed, when they are employed in so far as they want to be, is not a useful measure of unemployment and that resources have been badly targeted because of the lack of information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the gap between the live register and the labour force survey which peaked in 1996 when there were 90,000 more persons on the live register than in the labour force surveys.  The number at the end of 1997 has been reduced to 76,000 which is still enormous.  The CSO has conducted a number of surveys to explain the gap.  It has published and explained statistically the reason for the gap.  It is confident, as professionals in the statistics business, that the new quarterly labour force survey, based on the ILO system, will be much more useful.  It is adamant that the survey system gives a more comprehensive picture for policy purposes.  It provides more detail on how the labour market is working and the numbers involved in each sector than the live register, which is an administrative head count of the number of people in receipt of unemployment payments.  It causes confusion, particularly when one is trying to calculate unemployment rates.  The ILO has a new presentation which will show the standard unemployment rate. This will allow us to use the same basis for calculation that the other countries, with which we are compared, use.  I hope that will improve the situation. I accept this has been a problem for successive Governments.  There is less reliance on the live register which is used as a simple head count while policy decisions are based on labour force surveys and particularly the new quarterly survey, which will be published in April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs was established by the Government in July 1997 to tackle the problem of social exclusion in a holistic way and to build on and advance the work of the Cabinet drugs committee established under the previous Administration. The committee oversees the work being done under the Local Development Operational Programme, the national anti-poverty strategy and the national drugs strategy and aims to focus action across all Government Departments, agencies and programmes in addressing disadvantage in the broadest sense.</P>
      <P>The conduct of meetings of the Cabinet and its committees is an internal matter for Government. In the circumstances, I am precluded from divulging details of matters discussed by the committee or its recommendations or proposals to Government. However, the committee has met twice in 1998 and will continue to meet as frequently as required to co-ordinate the various initiatives which are being taken in the area of social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the latter part of 1997, the committee reviewed the findings of relevant Ministers on the extent of the needs of young people in the most disadvantaged areas, particularly those areas <Col N="1299" /> where a serious drugs problem exists.  As a result of proposals subsequently submitted to Government, a programme for young people at risk has been established, the centrepiece of which is a young people's facilities and services fund to which £30 million will be provided over the next three years.  This fund will be used to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>At least £20 million from the fund will be targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  The initial 1998 provision of £1.25 million allocated in the budget is now being increased to £7.5 million.  The fund is additional to the £10 million already approved by Government towards the implementation of the action plans of the 13 local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to ensure the co-ordination of measures to support young people &ldquo;at risk&rdquo;, the Government has appointed my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, to be Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in addition to Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister of State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy team, I intend to meet the chairpersons of the local drugs task forces in the near future to outline the Government's plans in relation to the operation of the young people's facilities and services fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Cabinet subcommittee met only once in 1997, it is a tribute to the effectiveness of Question Time in December that it has already met twice in 1998.  What are the guidelines for accessing the £30 million fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering the drawing up of guidelines for which I have been assigned responsibility.  I am working in consultation with my officials and I will bring forward detailed guidelines in March regarding access to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that no moneys have been paid out from the fund to date?  Given that the Minister of State is in charge of the national drugs strategy team will he make the allocations from the youth services development fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to complete the drawing up of the guidelines which I will bring from my Department to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.  That committee will make its recommendations which will ultimately be decided by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>From what Vote will the moneys be drawn?  Will the Minister of State accept if he is given responsibility &mdash; I have paid tribute to his commitment in the past &mdash; for politically driving the continued fight against the drugs menace, it <Col N="1300" /> is important that he, in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team, makes the decision? Is it the case that the Minister of State does not have control of the fund and that the Vote is in a different Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial provision of £1.25 million seed capital to establish the fund which allowed it to be placed on a firm footing was in the Department of Education and Science.  At least £20 million from the fund of £30 million will be targeted exclusively at those areas which cater for the 13 local drugs task forces.  Following completion of the guidelines the local drugs task forces will have a central role in accessing and planning the disbursement of those funds.  The question of administration of the funds will have to be worked out and will be covered by the guidelines which I hope to bring to Government in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the anti-drugs movement, in particular ICON, Inner City Organisations Network, and COCAD, Coalition of Communities Against Drugs, I welcome the fact that the Government has belatedly agreed to honour its commitment to establish a £20 million fund, specifically for heroin hit areas.  Although the Minister of State is dealing with the local drugs task forces in the disadvantaged areas affected, particularly in Dublin, he will not be in charge of or administer the fund.  Will this not cause difficulties and a great deal of confusion?  Despite the fact that he has been sidelined, will the Minister of State indicate when groups and organisations in the areas in question will be able to apply for funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been most successful in keeping faith with the original intent behind the establishment of the fund to which the previous Administration promised to allocate £20 million, although it has fallen on the Government to provide the money.  In its report the ministerial task force recommended that the £20 million should be directed exclusively at the areas covered by the local drugs task forces.  That is what will happen and there will be an additional £10 million for use in other areas.  I am drawing up guidelines on the administration of the fund with the assistance of the national drugs strategy team which is centrally involved and which has produced a paper for my consideration and further discussion within the Department before I present proposals to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs and a decision is made by the Government.  We will also work closely with other appropriate organisations such as the health boards, the local authorities, FÁS, the vocational education committees, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has belatedly decided to provide the money and the commitment of the Minister of State that it will be spent in the areas of greatest need as identified by the previous task force <Col N="1301" /> under the chairmanship of Deputy Rabbitte. Although the Minister of State is drawing up guidelines on the administration of the fund, it appears that it will not be under his control.  Will this not cause difficulties?  If the money is allocated to a different Vote, it will legally be the responsibility of another Minister and secretary general.  Is it not a matter of concern that the committee which is drawing up the guidelines will not have ultimate control over the disbursement of the money?  Will the Minister of State seek a formal Cabinet decision to ensure he has direct control and arrange for its immediate disbursement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines, when finalised, will meet the points raised by the Deputy and others. On the disbursement of the fund, the objective set will be achieved.  The allocations will be based on the recommendations of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs in accordance with Government procedure with which the Deputy is familiar.  The national drugs strategy team, the local drugs task forces and other organisations will be centrally involved based on the guidelines which are being drawn up on the proper disbursement of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The fund was established in the Department of Education and Science for procedural purposes.  I expect to make considerable progress on the guidelines during March and intend to ensure there is no undue delay.  We will channel the funds through agencies such as the Eastern Health Board, FÁS and the vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State seek Government approval to augment the funds available by the proceeds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau to ensure those who have suffered most at the hands of the drug barons benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that there may be legal difficulties in the direct transfer of proceeds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau but I am working on the proposition that an equal sum will be channelled to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept the goodwill of Members on this side of the House in respect of the lines of authority in the disbursement of the fund?  Will he agree it is the experience of this House that the Minister who controls the purse strings controls the decisions? Is he aware that in the first report of the ministerial task force on drugs the greater number of innovative proposals related to matters under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science? Is he also aware that the Department of Education and Science has done least to date to implement the proposals contained in that report and which has been most neglectful in implementing the terms of reference to which it <Col N="1302" /> agreed reluctantly?  Will he agree that it would not be in keeping with the concept of removing control from a line Department and giving it to a broader based strategy committee if he and his committee do not have a say in terms of where and how the moneys are spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy has the right to speak authoritatively on these matters. He made a significant contribution when chairperson of the ministerial task force.  The allocations will be based on the recommendations of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs. The funds have been allocated to the Vote of the Department of Education and Science for procedural reasons but this is not written in stone. The matter will be looked at again when the guidelines have been finalised.  While I take the Deputy's point on access to and control of the fund, the £20 million will be channelled to the areas covered by the local drugs task forces.  That will centrally involve the local drugs task forces working through the national drugs strategy team and drawing on the skill and expertise of other agencies working in the areas covered by the 13 local drugs task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Rabbitte's apprehension that the fund might be controlled through the Department of Education and Science. I hope, as the Minister of State indicated, that will change.  I understood originally it was intended the £20 million or £30 million in the fund would be the State's contribution and it was hoped a similar contribution would be made by the private sector.  Will the Minister indicate what steps have been taken to ascertain if there is a willingness on the part of the private sector to complement that fund or has any contact been made with it in regard to that original intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It became apparent there was an expectation the corporate sector would become involved in making additional allocations to the fund in question and I am encouraged by some initial contacts we have had from the corporate and private sectors on this matter.  In relation to their ability to contribute to the fund, we are working on guidelines and on other details that need to be attended to so as to ensure the corporate sector will not only find it possible to contribute to the fund but will be actively encouraged to do so in respect of specific proposals it might have in mind or to meet other proposals that will be brought forward, principally by the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that leading figures in the corporate sector inspired that idea?  Dr. Michael Smurfit made a speech at the time of the preparation of that report to the effect that the corporate sector would not be found wanting in terms of its contribution to such a fund and that is to be welcomed. I invite the Minister to indicate to the House his <Col N="1303" /> view on the share of the fund to be assigned to capital as opposed to non-capital projects.  I would like to hear his thinking on that critical question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the willingness of the corporate sector to contribute and the indications received from it, I am aware of the manner in which that suggestion arose.  I am encouraged by some initial contacts made with us on this matter. I can assure the Deputy we intend to vigorously pursue this issue.  I have an open mind as to the breakdown of the fund between facilities and services and I will be guided by the national drugs strategy team and the local drugs task forces because the position differs from one area to another.  One area might have what it considers sufficient infrastructure for what we are trying to do and might require more emphasis to be placed on services such as equipping clubs, providing staff to assist in the running of clubs or providing outreach personnel to search for those who are misusing drugs, an important aspect of my approach to this issue.  Another area covered by a local drugs task force might have a dearth of infrastructural facilities such as community halls, youth centres or other leisure and recreational facilities.  I have an open mind on that and I will be largely guided by the views expressed through the local drugs task forces and by the national drugs strategy team before I finalise what I hope will be an integrated approach to each local drugs task force area on how best that area can be served by the fund, whether in terms of infrastructure, services or a combination of both.  I note the Deputy's point which was well made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister of State took questions approximately two months ago he said he had made initial contacts and had discussions with the corporate sector, but he seems to have got no further since then.  Has he got a commitment from people in the corporate sector that they will allocate money to that fund?  The fund was announced 12 months ago but it has still not been set up.  The problem of young people abusing drugs is multiplying every day that fund is not being disbursed.  I urge the Minister to disburse the moneys immediately.  That committee has met only three times since last June.  We need action now, not talk about initial contacts and discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the work of the national drugs strategy team on how best to attract additional corporate contributions, it is my intention to make a proposal on that to the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion.  That represents progress.  Regarding the Deputy's remarks about progress in regard to the fund, a great deal of work has been done over the past number of months and that is not only work that takes place at meetings.  I assure the Deputy the national drugs strategy team is a fine <Col N="1304" /> operation and comprises very able people who are committed to trying to prevent drug misuse. That team is working diligently and is making considerable progress on a range of issues.  There will be no intentional delay in the disbursement of moneys from the fund.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that throwing money at problems is not necessarily the answer.  The answer is a well thought out, well developed and co-ordinated plan, particularly for the areas seriously affected by heroin abuse.  I am continuing along the lines set out in the two ministerial reports on the misuse of drugs.  I intend to ensure there will be no untimely delay in making moneys in the fund available through the local task forces to the areas where they are needed, those currently affected by heroin abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>By 17 February this year settlements had been reached in a total of 1,422 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 87 cases.  A further 59 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn. Compensation of £36.161 million and plaintiff costs of £6.136 million have been paid in respect of 1,568 cases finalised.  Since the beginning of this year 928 cases have been received, an average of 132 per week.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Law Society, officials of my Department met the society on 9 December 1997 and I met them on 20 January 1998.  A working group will continue the work of those meetings in seeking to explore ways to reduce legal costs in these cases.  A mutually convenient date for the meeting of the group is being arranged at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental working group, chaired by my Department, consists of representatives of the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the Office of the Attorney General.  It is tasked specifically with examining a number of legislative options which might be adopted to deal with this problem.  It met on three occasions since its formal establishment in January 1998.  Prior to that the departmental representatives were in <Col N="1305" /> regular contact.  The working group is making good progress.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on assessment of handicap resulting from hearing loss is expected shortly.  It is intended to adduce this report in evidence in further cases before the courts and it will be a matter then for the Judiciary to decide its evidential value.  As this is an outcome I cannot predict, I am not in a position to comment further on any effect the report may have on expenditure other than to say I hope it will provide a basis for uniformity and fairness of compensation.  Pending receipt of the report of that expert group all cases have been adjourned to the beginning of next term which I believe will be 21 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The selection of the expert group was a matter entirely for the Department of Health and Children and professional expertise and experience were the only criteria used in inviting members to participate.  Furthermore, that group was told at the outset that it was free to consult and take evidence from whomsoever it saw fit or necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the average number of cases per week has increased from 100 to 132 in the past few weeks.  The huge amount of publicity, the Minister's strong condemnation, and the highlighting of individual cases appear to have had the effect of increasing the number of cases.  The numbers have not diminished.  The Minister has a breathing space at present, given the High Court decision.  Is he seriously considering alternatives to the court route?  We must remember that expert opinion is not law and that, irrespective of what happens, the enormous numbers of cases have increased up to 132 per week and are still increasing, at huge cost to the Exchequer.  Genuine claimants are uncertain what the future holds for them.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister taken the opportunity of this breathing space to consult with the representative organisations, which have made a number of suggestions about an alternative route and want to meet him?  He has not set a date for the Law Society working group to begin its work, which is surprising because the Minister talked a good deal about reducing costs by 50 per cent.  Why has there been a delay in setting up the working group and discussing with lawyers how to reduce the costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject out of hand the contention that any effort made by the Department and myself in recent months has added to the number of cases coming forward.  There were over 6,200 cases last year and any measurement up to date indicates more or less the same picture.  There has been no increase but there has also been no decrease, which is still a worrying trend.  It is important to take into account that since this more integrated effort to manage the problem, the average quantum has come down by £7,500 per claim.  If that is stretched over the total number <Col N="1306" /> of claims it means a massive reduction, of the order of hundreds of millions of pounds, in the aggregate quantum and I am sure the Opposition parties have no objection to that.</P>
      <P>As to an alternative way of dealing with the problem, from the time I had the opportunity to assess all the aspects a number of factors have been absent.  First was an objective way of assessing hearing handicap which was acceptable to the courts.  Notwithstanding that acceptance, if it comes, the courts may not be the best place to deal with such huge numbers.  It would have an enormous paralysing effect on the High Court in terms of other injury claims.  I am therefore proceeding with my earlier proposal to establish a compensation board.  I must obviously take into account how the board will develop.  If the quantum in the courts were to remain as high as it is, notwithstanding its reduction, claimants would still be attracted to that system.  The establishment of a board must therefore await the outcome of the objective assessment of handicap, the reaction of the courts to that system and, we hope, a reduction in the quantum in those cases where there is little or no handicap.</P>
      <P>As far as genuine claimants are concerned, I am anxious to see the doors opening as quickly as possible to a comprehensive and equitable assessment of these cases.  There will be no holdup on my side.  The problem up to now was that the quantum awards were so high in respect of slight or no hearing handicap and the sheer numbers were such that it was essential for me to get a grip on the circumstances, as it would have two detrimental effects, the long-term results of which could be disastrous &mdash; first, the unique relationship between the Defence Forces and the people could be fractured permanently and, second, the taxpayers, who must carry the final load, would be asked to carry a burden which, in my view, would be unfair as against competing considerations in genuine handicap cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unclear &mdash; I thought the Minister said the number of cases per week had changed from 100 to 132, which is an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Morale is low and the Minister must outline what steps he intends to take to improve it.  We must take into account not only the Army compensation claims but the recent court martial, the other cases reported, the problems with key tasks such as search and rescue, the non-participation in the Partnership for Peace and the delay in publishing the Price Waterhouse report.  What steps does he intend to take to ensure morale is built up after this damaging period? When will the expert group report be ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The expert group report will be available in the first weeks of March and I will publish it immediately.  It is rather simplistic to blame the current Minister for Defence for a decline in morale in the Defence Forces arising from the present problem.  One in four currently serving members of the Defence Forces has submitted claims in respect of deafness &mdash; the distribution is uneven across the country but that is the overall figure.  I inherited this poisoned chalice from the Deputy's party, which was in charge while this problem built up.  To ignore it, if that is what she suggests, would be irresponsible politically and in every other way.  That is not to say I do not make mistakes but I am seriously trying to address the matter.</P>
      <P>One thing which has been helpful to me is the relationship I have maintained with the representative organisations.  Only one of every ten letters I receive from serving and retired soldiers and the public has been against the action I have taken. The leadership of the military authorities has agreed that we must come to grips with this by moving it out of the glare of publicity and establishing a fair and equitable system for dealing with the problem.  That is what I have set out to do and, despite the odd skirmish, most Opposition Deputies accept it is what we should do.</P>
      <P>As to building up morale, I visited the Glen of Imaal recently to meet young recruits &mdash; Deputy Timmins would be more familiar with activities there.  I was amazed at the level of morale.  I asked each recruit the same question &mdash; whether, in the midst of this crisis, he or she would join again &mdash; and they all said yes.  I have tried to make the first tranche of recruitment this year more equitable for female applicants as regards the height requirement.  We will continue with the refurbishment programme, the preparation for armoured personnel carriers and the preliminary response to that.  On every front, we will keep the positive elements going.  My hope is that in a few months, when the system is in place and it is fair to the public, the taxpayers and soldiers, and genuine claims can be dealt with quickly, we can concentrate on rebuilding what has been damaged. I accept damage has been done, although it has not been of my making.  My task is to instigate reform and bring closer the day when we can leave this traumatic experience behind.</P>

      <P>Given what the Minister has said about how he is not taking a high publicity <Col N="1308" /> approach but is tackling the problem in detail, I am puzzled by the slowness of some of the consultation with PDFORRA, RACO and the Law Society.  Not enough action has been taken on getting the working group in train with the Law Society.  Has the Minister had detailed discussions with the two representative organisations on setting up the compensation board?  Is he making progress in that regard?</P>

      <P>It was my decision to establish the Army compensation board.  As soon as I made up my mind I engaged in immediate consultations with RACO and PDFORRA and I won 100 per cent support for that arrangement.  I accept the working group could speed up its activities in relation to reducing the legal fees and I undertake to see what action could be taken to do that.</P>
      <P>I have had an uneasy relationship, in a sense, with the Incorporated Law Society because of what I said about a minority of the legal profession, particularly ambulance chasing solicitors. I saw red when I saw the advertisement in last Monday's <i>Evening Herald</i> with a freefone number and an offer to visit injured persons any evening, seven days a week.</P>

      <Quest>the number of soldiers who underwent audiogram tests in the periods 1952-60, 1960-70, 1970-80, 1980-90 and 1990-8; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Military personnel are provided with a comprehensive free medical service.  During the period 1952-90 all audiograms which were carried out on members of the Defence Forces were performed as part of investigation or treatment of individuals.  The records were parts of the individual medical records and were not consolidated; it is not possible, therefore, to give any estimate of the number of audiograms performed during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Consolidated records of audiograms are available from 1990.  Some personnel will have had more than one audiogram carried out.  The details are as follows: Eastern Command 1990-8, 6,293; Southern Command 1992-8, 10,569; Western Command 1995-8, 3,241 and Curragh Command 1995-8, 3,374.</P>
    <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force undergo audiometric testing when such tests are required on clinical grounds, or as part of the Defence Forces care of hearing programme.  Currently a programme of audiometric testing is in progress to ensure the hearing acuity of all members of the Defence Forces is established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the system of keeping individual records is one of the reasons the Defence Forces and the Department are now facing such problems?  Does he agree that the problem could have been apprehended at a far earlier stage if the information available to the Defence Forces and the Department had been acted upon sooner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that almost any organisation could improve on its history, and that is true of the Defence Forces also.  The records have not been consolidated so we do not know the position.  We know that an average of 100 audiometric tests were carried out each year. It appears there were no significant complaints by Army personnel in that area.</P>
      <P>From the late 1960s until 1987, when there was a much clearer position on employer's responsibility for safety at work, significant sums of up to £2 million were spent on hearing protective equipment.  However, we do not seem to be able to say in court that whoever was in charge on the day in question insisted that took place.  It seems it was spasmodic and could have been better.  The world would be a much better place if every detail which people know now could be put in place retrospectively.  However, we must try to make the best of the situation we have inherited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the Factories Act not applied to the Defence Forces, which would have allowed those records to be made available to the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly do not know the answer.  Personal medical records are quite a private arrangement, although we can examine how they could be consolidated.  However, it seems to be a matter of closing the door after the horse has bolted.  I have not engaged very much in the history of what happened.  There was a problem on my desk which I have tried to take forward.  We must learn the lessons of the past as quickly as possible so that nothing we do now will cause problems for future generations.</P>

The new organisation of the Naval Service and Air Corps has not been settled as yet, as it is the subject of a special study.  Any small number of vacancies that exist in particular ranks will be filled in the normal way.  The position in this regard is shown in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The procedures and criteria for promotion of NCOs are as prescribed in Defence Forces Regulations A.10 and in administrative instructions issued from time to time by the Adjutant-General.

      <P>The Minister did not really answer my question about the number of vacancies in the Defence Forces but referred to the new organisation and how the current strength of NCO members is over the limit.  However, numerous vacancies have not been filled for several years.  There are approximately 4,300 NCOs in the Defence Forces, which is approximately 40 per cent of the total strength.  Many of those people were denied promotion opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister referred to the criteria for promotion.  Army recruits undergo an interview procedure in which points are allocated for certain skills and so on.  Since the introduction of promotion on merit for officers they also have criteria for awarding marks.  However, there are no marking criteria for NCOs, who comprise 40 per cent of the Defence Forces.  The administrative instructions and Defence Forces regulations to which the Minister referred are just a generalisation. It depends on the interview board.  That leads to a great deal of frustration.  We all harp on about the deafness issue, but 100 matters, <Col N="1311" /> including the promotion of NCOs, must be sorted out.  I would appreciate if the Minister could examine that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Timmins's understanding of this matter.  I would not wish to withhold information from the House.  If that happened, it was unintentional.  There is no point in looking at the question of vacancies in terms of the old organisation.  One has to look at those in the light of the new organisation, and the fact that the figures have not come down to the required level is a difficulty.  However, I will take account of problems that have existed for a certain length of time with regard to promotions. Notwithstanding that the numbers are not right, I intend to do a certain amount to improve promotional opportunities for NCOs.  We have reached agreement with RACO in relation to promotions for officers.  It is necessary to put in place as quickly as possible an interim arrangement to allow a certain number of promotions to be made, even though they are slightly premature in terms of the totality of the new organisation. However, it is necessary to institute courses for potential officers and certain other procedures. What I am doing may not be as much as people want, but it will be a clear indication of my desire to prevent problems relating to promotional opportunity causing other wounds which can fester and in turn lead to more problems.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy has been in this House longer he will wonder how to find a totally independent board.  No sooner do we establish independent boards than Opposition Deputies want Ministers to make decisions.  For example, in the case of local authorities, once having powers means saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, they are widely accepted, but the harder decisions are passed back to the Minister.  It is very important that the selection process for all appointments should be transparently fair.  I do not have enough experience as Minister to comment on what has happened.  Obviously the Deputy has personal knowledge that he might give me at another time if he deems it appropriate, and I will certainly investigate it.</P>

      <P>A total of six non-commissioned personnel have been appointed to commissioned officer rank in the Naval Service since 1988.  Five non-commissioned personnel were appointed in 1992 on successful completion of a potential officers course and one in 1990 having been awarded a cadetship through the annual cadetship competition for 1988.</P>
      <P>Non-commissioned personnel serving in technical appointments who attain the required educational standard may be appointed to commissioned rank to fill a vacancy for technical officer, provided that they satisfy an interview board as to their suitability.  Non-commissioned personnel may also be appointed to be officers on successful completion of a potential officers course.  Serving members of the Defence Forces may also compete in the annual cadetship competitions, provided that they meet the criteria with regard to age, educational and medical standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there have been very few commissions from the non-commissioned officer rank to officer.  Is the Department considering advertising in the British press in the near future for commissioned officers in the Naval Service?  Why is that being done?  Why can the Department not organise advancement from within the ranks?  Is it true that in 1994 there were about 6,000 applicants for 70 places, and would the Minister agree that the applicants had a very high standard of education?  Would he further agree that the lack of a proper career path in the Naval Service for highly motivated and highly trained personnel is leading to a drop in morale?  What encouragement can the Department offer to young sailors to become officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of questions have been raised.  One of the commitments I gave as Opposition spokesperson on Defence was to see to what extent I could put in place a better career structure for the Defence Forces.  One necessary ingredient in doing that is constant recruitment.  All Administrations in the past made the mistake of stopping recruitment for long periods of time, resulting in humps and gaps. We should never go back to such practices which led to some of the present problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reply to the second part of the Deputy's question relies on the Price Waterhouse review which will be published in early March.  When a reorganisation drive is in progress, some problems tend to be left until the new organisation is in place.  I have no knowledge of advertisements being placed in papers abroad.  My information is that the main problem in terms of the promotion ladder had to do with the watch keepers and that new efforts are being made to encourage NCOs in the Naval Service to undertake a two to three-year training programme to qualify for this arduous position.  As soon as I have the report I will be looking at the possibility of establishing a different promotional regime in every branch of the Defence Forces because unless ambitious <Col N="1313" /> people who want to improve have a ladder of promotion onto which they can step, we will be presiding over many problems.  I want to be open to suggestions that have been made in this House as to how to achieve those aims.  In the meantime I will undertake to look at some of the matters the Deputy has raised about which I do not have precise information at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that recent reports in the press were incorrect?  Regarding reports in today's press, when does the Minister intend to advertise with a view to recruiting the 500 mentioned by the Department today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to recruitment, my announcement to this House in the latter stages of last year was that we would advertise in March. I intend to stick to that, and to come forward with the second tranche in June or July this year.  I do not have precise information in relation to any advertisement.  I will check it out.  I do not want to make any further comment because, in relation to the Air Corps, we may have to advertise for experienced pilots because of the number of pilots who want to retire.  We do not have adequate numbers to replace them on the Gulfstream and other aircraft.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the shortage of watch keepers.  The two coastal patrol boats, the LE <i>Orla</i> and <i>Ciara</i>, should be manned by a captain, engineer and three watch keepers. There is no difficulty with the technical or administration officers but there are only two watch keepers on each of these boats.  Does the Minister agree that this undermines the operational ability of those boats?</P>
      <P>I have previously raised with the Minister the height requirements for recruits.  While the Minister has reduced the requirement by one inch, there is a four inch difference between the height requirement for male and female recruits to the Garda.  I have been unable to establish the average height for male and female recruits and cannot throw statistics at the Minister.  However, I ask him to look again at this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the raising of this matter during a previous Question Time, I sought figures on which to make my assessment.  However, there is not much scientific evidence available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difference of three or four inches is too much and reflects badly on the female population.  Like the Deputy, I am not prepared to accept this difference and have introduced an interim measure. We must wait and see how this measure works.  I do not want to make comparisons between the Garda and Defence Forces in terms of the height requirements for recruits but one matter does arise.  When I visited the Glen of Imaal I picked up the equipment which is carried by personnel. I am not a judge of strength or the relationship between it and size but I would prefer to have as much assistance as possible in carrying the equipment. <Col N="1314" /> I would not like people to be injured because of their size, and this is a matter which must be taken into account.</P>

      <P>During the period December 1996 to January 1998, 91 non-commissioned personnel left the Naval Service, some having transferred to other areas of the Permanent Defence Force.  A total of 104 non-commissioned personnel were recruited to the Naval Service during the same period.  A total of 15 officers have left the Naval Service since 1996, while a total of 13 naval cadetships have been awarded during the same period.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that the Naval Service cannot be serviced in the way it should due to the lack of staff?  What further action does he intend to take to deal with this problem?  My colleague has given examples which show that under-staffing may have implications in terms of safety and morale.  Will the Minister agree that staff are being asked to carry out onerous duties due to the shortage in the number of personnel and have to spend longer periods at sea, etc?</P>

      <P>This can happen.  The number of personnel in the Naval Service has been reasonably consistent for some years.  The number of personnel joining the service approximates the number leaving it.  Notwithstanding recruitment programmes in recent years, we have not been able to make a gain in terms of personnel.  I will look at the recruitment programme and its effect on the Naval Service when I receive the report.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to purchase a new ship and additional personnel will be required to man it. Advice I have received suggests different structures for manning ships.  The one thing that is certain is that we need increased numbers to deal with the problems in the service.  This matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I would hate to think we have to walk fast merely to stand still in terms of the number of staff.  We need to recruit additional staff and to retain the maximum number possible in the service. These people have been trained and have gained much experience over the years.  An amazing amount of training is required to gain the necessary expertise for some positions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My point relates to the number of specialist staff, for example, pilots, computer staff etc., who are leaving the Naval Service.  Will the Minister set up a specialist group to examine how this is dealt with in other areas of the Defence Forces?  This matter requires urgent attention in addition to the publication of the Price Waterhouse report.</P>

      <P>We are in the process of finalising the new pay arrangements and allowances and ironing out other difficulties, for example, the promotional ladder, which needs to be built up, and the constant recruitment of personnel. However, one cannot prevent people from seeking opportunities in other areas which have been developed as a result of the Celtic tiger.  At Baldonnel Airport six applications have been processed and agreed, while another eight are in <Col N="1316" /> hand.  The aviation industry and other industries have grown in recent years and there are more opportunities available.  We need to keep trained personnel in the service but they also have the right to seek employment in areas where they can use their talents to best advantage.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Children, introduce a programme in schools which highlights the opportunities available in the Naval Service?  An advertisement in the newspapers is not adequate in terms of engendering the excitement that is the Naval Service.  Will the Minister discuss with the Minister for Education and Science the feasibility of introducing in schools a programme which will encourage students to apply for positions in the Naval Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will not rely on an advertisement in the newspapers to recruit personnel to the Defence Forces.  I support the points made by him.  I want to ensure that the recruitment programme is aimed at second level students and is carried out in such a way that it highlights the attractiveness of a career in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>To be engaged in high profile advertising in the national newspapers for recruitment of this kind is a waste of taxpayers' money.  It should be more specifically oriented to second level students on an ongoing basis now because we know there will be consistent recruitment.</P>
      <P>It comes back to being able to solve the problems of reorganisation which exist in the service because of people's choices.  They have a range of choices, which is great for them but that causes its own pressures for some of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that part of the problem in the Naval Service has to do with the fact that an army structure is imposed on the service?  Will he also agree there are certain social problems attached to the Naval Service? What is his Department doing to support and look after the families of members?  Does it understand the social and specific family problems associated with the Naval Service?</P>
      <P>Is there a promotion board examining promotion from ordinary ranks to officer rank at present?  When will that board report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the difficulty in the Naval Service is with regard to the seagoing allowance which works out at between £12 and £16 per day depending on rank, which ends up at approximately between £6 and £8 per day after tax.  Will the Minister consider increasing this allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, it always struck me as unusual when Spike Island was handed over to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that, in addition to security costs, the Naval Service <Col N="1317" /> accommodation had to be upgraded before the prisoners went into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be happy to know we are continuing to upgrade facilities in Haulbowline for the Naval Service.  I laid the foundation stone recently for a £2 million investment there.</P>
      <P>I will report back to the Deputy with information on any promotion board sitting at present. My guess is that in relation to general reorganisation very little of any significance is happening but I undertake to check up on it.</P>
      <P>The social aspect, to which Deputy Stanton referred, is very important.  We are probably only at the very early stages of developing qualified counselling personnel to deal with the kinds of difficulties which can arise and to liaise with the families.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins is correct that there is a problem with the seagoing allowance, which is now called &ldquo;the patrol allowance&rdquo;.  We are engaged with the representative association on how we can increase that in the overall pay deal.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to meet some of the counselling services.  The question of how we must address the problem is bigger than we thought.  We are learning every day about personnel management and the importance of coping with the problems which arise in different professions. We are getting better at it, but there is certainly room for improvement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 25, 46, 85, 90, 102, 125, 181, 182, 197, 200, 202 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the effort to make sure these questions got on to the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The number of Air Corps cadets recruited for pilot training in each of the years 1990 to 1997 was as follows: 1990, seven; 1991, none; 1992, eight; 1993, none; 1994, eight; 1995, ten; 1996, ten; 1997, ten.</P>
    <P>There are currently seven senior Air Corps cadets in training as pilots and a further ten Air Corps cadets will commence their pilot training in May.  Air Corps cadets will again be recruited this year as part of the annual cadet intake.  The total strength of the Air Corps at the end of December 1997 was 1,037.</P>
    <P>Eleven of the 26 pilots to which the service commitment scheme was offered are participating in the scheme and one response is still outstanding. The scheme was offered to experienced personnel who are rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA, Dauphin, Squirrel and Defender aircraft, which are the principal operational aircraft of the Air Corps.  The three officers who have made the three year commitment are qualified on the Dauphin helicopter and five of the officers who made a five year commitment are also qualified on this aircraft.  Of the other three officers with a five year commitment, one has a rating on the Gulfstream IV aircraft, one on the CASA aircraft and one on the Marchetti aircraft.</P>
    <P>To date two applications for permission to retire have been submitted by Air Corps pilots. One is from a commandant with a current rating on the Gulfstream IV aircraft and the other is from a captain with a rating on the Squirrel helicopter. Both of these applications are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary to contract a civilian pilot of rating examiner status from time to time for the purpose of training and rating pilots on the Gulfstream IV aircraft.  This need has arisen because pilots with sufficient experience to carry out ratings have not always been available in the Air Corps.  It may also be necessary to engage a civilian pilot as an aircraft captain later this year due to the high level of retirement from the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots introduced by my Department last year, together with the ongoing training of pilots and the yearly recruitment of Air Corps cadets, will ensure a continuing supply of well trained pilots for the Air Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply highlights the importance of continuous recruitment, particularly at a time when the economy is doing so well and there will be demands made on our pilots and offers of opportunities outside the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that the incentive scheme will not provide the whole answer to the problem facing the Air Corps.  The Minister spoke of recruiting civilian pilots for the Government jet. We have already had a discussion here about the east coast search and rescue service for which the <Col N="1320" /> Air Corps cannot supply the pilots, which is unfortunate for morale in the Air Corps.  Indeed, we have seen the Air Corps providing a back-up role today.  I think the Air Corps would like to be the ones in the front line all the time.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a major problem.  What extra initiatives does the Minister intend to take to ensure there will be enough pilots, given that there are obviously not enough at present?  It is clear that recruitment numbers must be higher than they have been in recent years if we are to have a steady supply of experienced pilots available to do the sort of tasks the Minister and I would ideally like to see the Air Corps having the resources to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always amazed at the confidence which the Opposition parties place in me, that I am almost capable of being Solomon when it comes to an impossible problem like this.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have applications from six experienced pilots for leave before 30 June.  These applications have been processed and agreed.  Some of them have been delayed a little, but there has been no compulsory retention.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are a further eight applications for leave from experienced people under consideration.  Due to the time lag between training cadets and moving them up to rating for Gulfstream IV and other aircraft &mdash; one is talking about a number of years and flying hours &mdash; there is no immediate recipe open to me to fill those gaps because of the numbers retiring at present.</P>
      <P>The incentive scheme to which the Deputy referred involves retention of 11 out of 26 pilots. On the one hand, the scheme is quite successful but it would have been so much better if it was more successful.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  We must maintain the recruitment programme and make sure there are enough people joining the Air Corps.  What we are not able to do is give any guarantee that they will remain with us once they have covered their service period.  That is a real short-term problem. I hope it is not a long-term problem for us, but I have no guarantee that it is not.  This short-term problem can only be solved by advertising for civilian pilots to help us overcome some of the problems we may face in the next year or two.  It is a source of regret to me, as it is to the Deputy, that in regard to search and rescue we can only do so much in the south-east.  We will be in a position to fly the Alouette, which has a limit of three miles in daytime, and perhaps a year later we can increase the Dauphin coverage.  That is the reality.  In terms of additional incentives to address the immediate problem, we must retain people as best we can, ensure we have sufficient resources and maintain the recruitment programme, although experienced personnel have told me there is no way to fast-track aircraft training. This is a serious business and I do not have the technical expertise to suggest that training should be shortened by one or two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the matters we discussed recently.  Because of the dilemma we face no final decisions have been taken on it.  In terms of the numbers that can be recruited, there are obvious limits due to training personnel, the number of aircraft available and the length of time involved.  I must add another rider which is that if the aviation industry is so strong it can wait for me to do the hard slogging, the taxpayer to put in the resources and all the training to be done so that it can come in at that stage when the experienced persons are available and make an offer with which I cannot compete, we have to begin to examine the wider questions involved.</P>

      <P>Has there been a change in the panel of barristers engaged by the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General and, if so, will the Minister accept that it would not be proper for new barristers who had acted for the State to continue to act for the plaintiffs in these cases as they would be privy to confidential information? What assistance is obtained from the legal advisers from the point of view of examining the way we can minimise the cost of this flood of claims, which is horrendous?  I understand there is an overhang of £100 million from last year with a quarter of cases having been disposed of at a cost of £40 million.  The Minister spoke about 132 new cases each week and on that basis the cost will be £5 million per week.  Has any thought been given to changing the law having regard to the Garda Síochána compensation Acts and the way those claims are dealt with?  Furthermore, does the Minister not consider it ridiculous that people are now putting in claims for injuries that are alleged to have occurred 20 or more years ago? How can we continue with a legal system that accepts such claims which are impossible to disprove? I am outraged at the notion of somebody claiming from the taxpayer for something that happened over 20 years ago.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the claims do not stop at 20 years, they go back as many as 40 years. I had no idea when I came in here today that I would for a brief moment defend the legal profession against somebody like Deputy O'Keeffe. I do not think he would suggest that barristers, whatever their varied experience, would do other than the right thing in terms of their training to represent their clients.  I have no knowledge of any change in the panel of barristers.  I do not have an input to these matters, nor do I wish to, beyond checking the current position.  There will not be any influence on my side in regard to who is selected to carry out a particular function. Because of the increase in numbers the expectation might be that there should be an increase in the number of people appointed.  I have no knowledge of that but it would be logical since there are many more cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the broader question the Deputy asked, it is a frightening prospect.  We have had virtually unanimity in this House in regard to trying to cut off the fast-track which was developing and ensure that genuine cases are dealt with in a fair and equitable way without encouraging thousands <Col N="1323" /> of others who have little or no handicap in comparison to the people we represent who have a significant handicap.</P>
    <P>People say we should not be involved in by-election canvassing, that we should be doing other work.  During the canvass in Limerick East last Sunday &mdash; the Deputy was there also &mdash; when other people were playing golf or doing something else, I visited a house where a foster mother lived.  She showed me a cerebral palsy child of five years old and a blind child of 18 months and told me there were very few support systems in place for them.  At that moment I was conscious that the moneys being spent on legal services on one case alone would have been an enormous help in that circumstance.  It only adds to the determination of this House, and I appreciate the overall support I have received, to corral these claims in a fair and equitable way.  We will not stand in the way of a person with a genuine claim but we have an overall responsibility to the common good.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in some US states legislation is being introduced to put ambulance chasing solicitors behind bars for 18 months because of their advertising which encourages people to make claims.</P>

      <P>PRSI has been cut for those on low pay.  There has been a major improvement in the family income supplement scheme, probably the most significant since the introduction of the scheme in 1984.  From June, the amount of FIS payable will increase by £4 per week and, from October, FIS will be calculated on the basis of take home pay, resulting in an average increase of £11 per week. This is another example of the Government delivering on commitments in the action programme, Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Major improvements have been made in support for older people, people with disabilities and carers.  We must look after those who are out of the workforce.  The Bill is a sign of the Government's care and commitment to the less well off in society.  It underlines our determination to ensure everybody benefits from economic growth and gives the lie to those who claim that we favour the better off.  We have honoured our pledge to put people before politics.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute, albeit briefly, to the Social Welfare Bill, 1998.  I offer my support and congratulations to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the presentation of his first Social Welfare Bill and on his efficient and sensitive handling of this most important brief.  How is a State to be judged: by economic performance, the ideology of individualism or the quality of its roads, water supply, ESB and other services?  In this era, for many, those are the benchmarks of success.  They are important, as economic performance and the growth of individual talents are praiseworthy, but they must not be an end in themselves.  Community responsibility, caring and social solidarity must not be pushed to the background. The way society cares for the marginalised, the aged, children, the unemployed, widows, the homeless, the sick and the low paid is the true measure of its worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks back though history, one finds that the figures who stand out over the years are not those who spent their lives solely in making money but those who spent their energy in <Col N="1326" /> improving society for the benefit of all citizens. They include politicians and those who helped and guided them, such as Mother Teresa, Vincent de Paul, John Bosco, Florence Nightingale and many others who gave their lives to help the under-privileged.  In this age of individualism, it would be good to ponder the lessons of history.  I hope we will not forget the neighbourliness and caring spirit that existed in our forefathers' time.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare of 1986 states: &ldquo;Social Welfare payments should be set at a level that ensures a minimally adequate standard of living relative to incomes and living standards in society generally&rdquo;.  Since then successive Governments have attempted to make improvements to meet the recommended levels.  As a result of this Bill, 94 per cent of people on weekly social welfare payments will receive more than the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. That is right and fitting as less fortunate members of society should also receive the benefits of the booming economy.</P>
    <P>I have faith in our society, as evidenced by the excellent work carried out in every town and village by Church bodies and other voluntary organisations, manned by people who in their spare time provide services to the sick, disabled and under-privileged, such bodies as the St. Vincent de Paul Association, those who look after resource and day care centres, wheelchair associations, COPE and many other organisations.  The State must play its part directly through its schemes and indirectly by the provision of reasonable grant aid and advice to voluntary organisations.  I am pleased such aid is increasing year after year.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is the first major Bill to come before the House in fulfilment of the commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to address the issues of social exclusion, marginalisation and poverty in our community.  The Bill provides for meaningful, substantial increases in all social welfare payments.  For example, old age pensions have increased by a flat rate of £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the behaviour of Deputy Howlin who is perceived as being a responsible politician.  He entered the House a few moments ago, called for a quorum and promptly disappeared.  The 1798 Rebellion is being celebrated this year and, unlike Deputy Howlin, I am sure the people of County Wexford did not run away when a challenge was put to them.  I would like the Deputy to re-enter the House and I will take him on, with or without pikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Howlin departed because he does not like the information detailed in the Social Welfare Bill, which puts to shame the provisions made by a Minister from a so-called <Col N="1327" /> socialist party, the ultimate socialist and then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa. We can see, from what is being provided by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, that Deputy De Rossa's performance is being put to shame.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill provides for real, meaningful and substantial increases in the value of all social welfare payments.  That cannot be said for recent legislation in this area.  Old age pension payments have been increased by £5 per week which is equivalent to a 7 per cent increase on the current rate.  Other payments have been increased by at least 4.5 per cent at a time when inflation stands at approximately 2.5 per cent. This shows that the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party are in touch with reality, understand the people and know what must be done to improve society and help the less well off.  The Minister has provided increases this year to take account of these problems.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement has helped keep people at work in recent years.  It has ensured that those who want to work can remain in employment without suffering financially.  As promised in the programme for Government and the Fianna Fáil manifesto, family income supplement will be improved, in terms of qualification, from next year.  It will be assessed on the basis of net earnings, namely, gross income less superannuation contributions, income tax and PRSI.  I welcome this improvement which is designed to ensure that unemployed people are given the incentive to take up work.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement was introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, and it has been of tremendous benefit over the years.  The carer's allowance scheme was also introduced by Deputy Woods.  This scheme was designed to make payments to daughters and sisters who remained at home to care for elderly or sick relatives.  These people were not entitled to payment from the State because they were not available for work.  Fianna Fáil saw that this was wrong and needed to be changed.  As a result, Deputy Woods introduced the scheme.  Successive Ministers have improved the scheme and it is being further improved by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  It is one of the most worthy schemes to be put in place since I entered the Dáil and I am glad it will be improved further by the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The summer job scheme for students has been of tremendous benefit to many young people. However, problems exist in some areas because there is a shortage of students available to carry out work.  Certain students do not qualify for the scheme owing to the fact that their parents are slightly over the income limit.  This scheme should be reconsidered, particularly in respect of communities which require work to be done and where students who do not qualify are available to do it.  These individuals should be allowed to <Col N="1328" /> partake in the scheme.  I do not know what this would cost the State but the value to be gained would far outweigh it.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill highlights the caring nature of the Government.  It shows that the Government and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs are aware of the problems faced by the less well off in marginalised sectors of society, such as the socially disadvantaged, children and widows.  The Minister has decided to provide an easement in the qualifications and rules for accessing certain social welfare schemes. Rental income will be disregarded for the purpose of widow's and widower's pensions where the rent is paid by a person who lives with the widow or widower and the widow or widower would otherwise live alone.  This is a socially beneficial change.  It has become more dangerous for people, especially older people, to live alone due to the levels of crime.  Many people might prefer to live with a relation but live alone because they might lose some income.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this enlightened Bill.  If he continues in this mode he will ensure by the end of his term in office that society will be much better off.</P>

      <P>I will concentrate on the impact of this Bill on the elderly.  I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the introduction of his first Social Welfare Bill.  I cannot wish him many more such opportunities but I hope he will be able to advance the circumstances of the large numbers in society dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies will have received representations from the Carers' Association which represents the many carers who take care of tens of thousands of people, often on a voluntary basis. The Minister will be aware from his discussions and meeting with the Carers' Association in advance of the publication of the Bill that it had certain requests for changes which it hoped would be introduced in the Bill.  Unfortunately, their requests have fallen on deaf ears.  I appeal to the Minister to respond more favourably to those requests on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association had two points it particularly wished to be addressed.  First, that the means test for the carer's allowance would be calculated on the basis of net means.  Such a change has been made for the family income supplement and the Minister should extend it to the carer's allowance. This would make a meaningful difference for a group of people who by their everyday work do an economic and social service for the State.  The second request was for a disregard of an additional £50 per week of income as part of the means test.  The Minister was unable to respond <Col N="1329" /> favourably but I ask him to consider the matter further.  The Carers' Association has indicated its bitter disappointment with the failure of the Bill to address these points.</P>
    <P>The £5 per week increase in pensions for the elderly was announced with a fanfare.  However, the increase is not available on the same basis to adult dependants.  I do not imagine the Minister will address the matter on Committee Stage but point out that all is not as rosy as might have appeared from the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>Historically there have been difficulties with means tests.  There should be a more simple and uniform means testing system.  When the Minister examines this issue he should consider the position of those who have a capital asset being assessed.  The income gained from the asset rather than a notional value of it should be taken into account.  The present system is unfair and needs to be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister I hope he can secure bigger budgets for social welfare during his tenure, particularly with regard to the integration of social services and increasing the information available to people seeking the services. The assessment for family income supplement on the basis of net income is welcome. The agencies dealing with social welfare recipients are aware of the poor take-up of the scheme, often among those who need it most, because of the difficulty of calculating entitlements and the fear of not being eligible.  The widest possible range of advice and information on the scheme should be made available.  I welcome the interdepartmental review of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>We can never support children enough, especially children from disadvantaged areas who face inequalities of opportunity.  I am disappointed with the small increase in child benefit.  I welcome the recognition of twins as multiple births to the extent that the benefit is one and a half times the standard rate.  Perhaps in the next budget the Minister will be able to increase that to double the rate.  Parents of twins, particularly the mother who has given birth, find it hard to understand why the birth is not recognised as a multiple birth.  The costs are doubled for twins.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement will help encourage people to move from welfare to training and employment.  The medical card should be extended to cover all children under 17 years of age.  Parents will put up with a lot of risks for themselves but are afraid to lose the medical card for their children's sake.  Such a change would be an incentive for parents to move into employment and consequent independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years I have raised a number of questions on Social Welfare Bills and I am pleased to be back again to raise them.  When will the work of women in the home be recognised?  They should be allowed to be included on the live register to give them opportunities for training.  It is outrageous that having made their contribution to the family they cannot take up training and <Col N="1330" /> employment opportunities like the rest of the population.  They are a great resource which we cannot afford to ignore, especially given the present labour shortages.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to increase the special grants to women's community groups.  Those grants are extraordinary good value.  Child care facilities should be a consideration in the grants.  Otherwise the funding will not reach the women we wish to support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise only two matters because of time restrictions.  The first matter relates to the <i>pro rata</i> non-contributory old age pension.  This was organised and proceeded with by the Minister's predecessor and I am glad he has continued with it because a huge number of people have yet to be facilitated in this area.  The previous change in the <i>pro rata</i> system helped totally or partially about 8,000 people but another major step must be taken.  I raised this with a number of Ministers for Social Welfare but as time goes on the problem becomes more acute.</P>
      <P>People who joined the self-employed scheme in 1988 had to be 56 years or under and contribute for ten years so that when they reached pension age they would be entitled to a full contributory old age pension.  The case has been made many times that this should also be a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  The Department calculated a number of years ago that it would be costly but after this year no new people will qualify for it anyway because they would have contributed for ten years and would not be examined.  Self-employed people, many of whom are farmers, who joined the scheme in 1988 and contributed in the normal way now find themselves a year or two short and will only receive part of their contribution when they reach pension age.  That is unfortunate as the problem resolves itself after this year.  The people involved do not expect to receive a full pension because they are not entitled to it but they are entitled to something.  <i>Pro rata</i> contribution requirements have been reduced from 20 to ten per years over an individual's working life and there must be a mechanism through which something can be done in the next budget for those involved.</P>
      <P>The first £2,000 is disregarded for those qualifying for REPS and if they have applied for unemployment assistance, non-contributory old age pension or pre-retirement allowance another 50 per cent of their income above £2,000 will be disregarded.  I agree with this enlightened approach.  However, what has the Minister got against widows who received non-contributory pensions?  I cannot understand why they have not been brought into that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate Deputy Browne's comments earlier. I meet an increasing number of women who are angry and frustrated because they are not allowed on FÁS training schemes which would allow them to gain employment, only because their husbands or partners earn a certain income.  That system is wrong, but I do not know how the Minister can <Col N="1331" /> address it.  However, whoever addresses it will earn a great deal of kudos because it is a problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister looks favourably at the question of increasing subventions to private nursing homes.  This is one of the best systems ever introduced and there is not a village in Ireland that has not a nursing home built or about to be built.  This social need has been addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with my pet subject, the carer's allowance.  I have addressed this issue with previous welfare Ministers, but this is my first opportunity to raise it with the current incumbent.  Approximately 10,000 people receive the allowance and it was one of the best schemes introduced.  Carers are the unsung heroes of the population.  They give full-time care, often on a 365 days per year basis, for patients or elderly people, some of whom are bed ridden or incontinent. Approximately 60,000-80,000 other carers do not receive an allowance because of various regulations, but they also provide excellent care and attention.</P>
      <P>Not alone do they provide an excellent service for the £34 million spent on the allowance, they save the Exchequer hundreds of millions of pounds by keeping elderly people out of institutional or nursing home care which is also a drain on it.  I appeal to the Minister to extend the allowance to some of those people as it will not cost the Exchequer in the long run and will lead to a substantial saving. A review of the scheme was carried out last year by the Department and a report on it was to be published early this year.  When will it be published? I am anxiously looking forward to it as I made submissions to the reviews.  In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to relaxing the qualification criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure more carers can benefit.  There is no evidence of that in the Bill but I hope it will change when the report is published.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw an anomaly in the scheme to the Minister's attention, which should be corrected following the review.  It concerns a woman who qualifies for the carer's allowance and cares for relatives of her husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That person's husband, whether a farmer or a wage earner, can earn up to £162 per week and she will still receive the carer's allowance.  If through an accident or otherwise she becomes a widow, she will receive the widow's pension to <Col N="1332" /> compensate for the loss of her husband's earnings, but she will lose her entitlement to the carer's allowance.  That is a blatant anomaly in the scheme.  As very few carers become widows in any one year, this would not put a great drain on the Exchequer.  It is unfair that a person caring for her husband's bedridden parents should lose entitlement to the carer's allowance because she qualifies for the widow's pension.  That pension should compensate her only for the loss of her husband's earning capacity.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance should not be subject to income tax.  It is already subject to means testing, with a threshold of £162 per week.  Therefore, the household income would be low.  If a woman qualifies for a carer's allowance and her husband is on low wages, the allowance is added to the husband's income for income tax purposes.  That anomaly should be rectified.  I appeal to the Minister to broaden the qualifications so that more people can qualify for this worthy allowance.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on striking the correct note in this Bill.  Changing the name to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs makes an important statement about the balance that needs to be struck between the different sectors of society.  There is an obvious emphasis on the family.  The social welfare system is important for those at work and those who may leave the workforce.  The Department plays a major role in promoting community initiative at individual and group level.</P>
      <P>We can be proud of our social welfare system. For a country of our size and amount of resources, and with the range of competing demands on us, we can be proud of what we have achieved.  We have targeted vulnerable groups such as single parents, children and the elderly.  I have often criticised the social welfare system.  It has grown in such an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion that it is similar to a house to which multiple extensions have been added without planning permission.  That inevitably causes problems.  I will not pretend to be an expert in resolving problems, but I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he addressed a number of anomalies in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in Partnership 2000 are reflected in the Social Welfare Bill.  I am particularly pleased the Government decided to adopt an anti-poverty strategy.  Tackling poverty requires a redistribution of resources through tax and welfare reform, improved child income support, job creation, skills training and significant additional resources for education, health, housing and other services.  The national anti-poverty strategy is a crucial development because of its <Col N="1333" /> across-the-board nature.  It will be deeply embedded in the political and administrative institutions of the State.  The strategy sets targets for the year 2007 to be achieved by co-ordinated action.  I look forward to seeing that strategy reflected in forthcoming social welfare action.</P>
    <P>This Bill has focused on two key groups, the young, particularly children, and the elderly.  I am delighted the Government has seen the need to support the ever-increasing numbers of elderly people.  We are not just rewarding them for services rendered, we are recognising the role they play in active retirement.  In this regard, I compliment the emergence in recent years of the Irish senior citizens' parliament which has put forward a number of worthwhile objectives to be realised in the coming years.  It wants the State pension to be set at 40 per cent of the average industrial wage, with a basic rate of £110 per week and <i>pro rata</i> increases for dependants.  I am pleased An Action Programme for the Millennium proposes a figure of £100 as a realisable objective for the year 2000.  I am confident the Government will exceed that figure.  There was a reference to pensioners' eligibility for medical cards.  I ask the Minister to consider that as a desirable objective to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had an opportunity to speak on the Bill and I commend the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the provisions in the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its presentation and content.  While I welcome the many increases in benefit provided for in the Bill, in the short time available I want to refer specifically to the carer's allowance.  I am pleased the Minister considered the submissions made to him by many outside bodies.  It is crucial to address the carer's allowance under this Bill.  The health boards have made us aware of the ever-increasing number of elderly people.  Figures show that in future 90 per cent of the elderly population will live in the community and 10 per cent in institutionalised care. Therefore, it is important provide for them, particularly when we have a healthy economy. From figures released by the Carers' Association, I understand there are 30,000 full time carers and 100,000 part-time carers.  We should take cognisance of the legislation that deals with subventions for nursing homes.  The levels of subvention should be increased on a yearly basis.  There are great demands on nursing homes and health board hospitals.  We are moving towards more community-based nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in old age pensions, to which we committed ourselves in the programme for Government.  I also welcome the change in respect of the family income supplement.  It is important to actively encourage people back to work.  That the social welfare improvements amount to £125 million this year and £225 million in a full year is recognition of the Government's commitment.  As a new Deputy I am pleased that commitments made in the programme for <Col N="1334" /> Government are being realised.  It is particularly important that the healthy economy is reflected in the Social Welfare Bill.  It is worth noting that overall spending in 1998 amounts to £4,850 million. This underlines the Government's commitment. Not only are we talking about social inclusion but resources are being committed to it.  That £525 million has been allocated to social inclusion measures is welcome.  This is particularly important given that the Minister and others had made previous commitments.  It is important also to acknowledge the <i>pro rata</i> pension increases.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in the budget are welcome but we must pay more attention to carers. While we cannot ignore the means test procedure we should commit ourselves to easing it in over the next few years.  Also the residence requirement should be looked at.  While I understand the need for the carer to be in the same household, often in rural areas the carer may live next door.  It is ridiculous to deprive a carer in those circumstances from receiving the allowance.</P>
    <P>Young widows who are anxious to take part in community employment schemes should be encouraged to do so.  Increased grants should be paid to women's community groups.  It is important to involve community groups in further education or in community employment projects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill particularly in view of prior commitments.  In our booming economy it is important to recognise those who made a commitment in the early stages to the Celtic tiger.  I am delighted to be part of a Government that has done more than pay lip service to old age pensioners and that we are living up to our commitments to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for his interest in this area and the marvellous work done since becoming Minister.  I welcome the pro work aspects of the budget.  This nails the lie that people are better off on welfare. The social provisions will have many positive effects: a more secure future for older people, the £5 increase which is the highest percentage increase in recent years; improvements in the real value of social welfare payments, with 560,000 claimants benefiting from an increase of over 4 per cent; significant extra support for people with disabilities and carers which signifies a doubling of the sums offered by the previous Administration. Since this Government came to power a total of £38.4 million has been allocated to this sector.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues who paid tribute to the wonderful work being done by carers.  Any improvements that can be made in this area are important.  A carer who cannot live with the elderly people being cared for, in the event of accommodation not being available, but lives next door, should be eligible for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support is being provided for families and communities through the increase in child benefit, the <Col N="1335" /> expansion of family mediation services, support for marriage and child counselling and family resource centres and measures to encourage people to take up work.  Some 5,000 extra places have been provided on the back to work scheme. A single person who qualifies for one of these places will be £50 better off.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement will be calculated on net take home pay and will benefit 7,200 families who will gain an average of £11 per week.  All current recipients will automatically benefit by at least £4 per week.</P>
    <P>The £3,000 tax allowance for the long-term unemployed returning to work means that 60,000 people will not have to pay PRSI but will retain their entitlements to benefits.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with those who are just short of the ten years and do not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Those who have contributed receive only 53 per cent of their contributions having paid PRSI for, say, nine years and do not qualify for a contributory pension.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this and see whether a part payment pension can be given to these people who have contributed for close on ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his first Social Welfare Bill.  I express my appreciation of his dynamic and fresh approach to the Department.  That is evident in the new title of the Department and is reflected in the manner in which he is addressing the matters relating to community and family affairs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill addresses the issues of social exclusion, marginalisation and poverty.  I welcome also the real increases in social welfare payments which will take effect from June.  I pay tribute to the army of voluntary workers who work with the marginalised and the less well off in society and particularly the elderly whom they call on and do their shopping and so on.  Will the Minister look at the feasibility of putting in place a special incentive to assist those people in the delivery of their services, particularly meals on wheels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From its introduction the carer's allowance has been a social welfare payment.  Most of us recognise the huge potential that exists in regard to this payment.  I have listened to some of my colleagues speak on this issue.  The carer's allowance must be aligned to the needs of the elderly in society who want to remain in their homes and community and who may have no alternative except institutional care or a bed in a private nursing home.  Will the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs with the Minister for Health and Children introduce a pilot project, preferably in Dublin, mainly because of the shortage of longstay accommodation for the elderly? The insufficiency of beds is causing problems for elderly people living alone who may become ill and require support and who may not have somebody <Col N="1336" /> to care for them.  An innovative approach should be adopted.  The amounts payable should be similar to the subventions payable in respect of long stay accommodation &mdash; £75, £90 and £120. The harness should be removed to allow the potential of the scheme to be exploited.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the sharing of data. This has much merit.  It has been indicated that this will be restricted to specially programmed computer systems but to allay concern the matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with recovery procedures.  My attention is continually drawn to the position of lone parents.  Will the Minister indicate the total amount paid annually to lone parents and the total amount recovered?</P>
    <P>The total amount paid in supplementary welfare allowance in respect of mortgage and rent payments is huge.  At the same time the problem of homelessness is acute, particularly in Dublin. Will the Minister consider a special initiative in this area given that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is not in a position to provide the necessary accommodation to resolve the problem?</P>
    <P>While I appreciate there is a departmental help line, will the Minister consider providing, even for one week or a fortnight, a freefone service to allow claimants obtain all the information they require?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Social Welfare Bill the Minister has introduced.  As he may not have had enough time before the preparation of the budget to appreciate what it is like to be totally dependent on social welfare, it is proper that those of us who are close to the grass roots highlight the anomalies in the system, despite the improvements made in the Bill which affects the lives of over one million people.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Department, with some exceptions, has become more user-friendly.  It is essential, from the point of view of those who have made a major contribution during their working lives through their social insurance contributions or who are precluded because of illness or poor health from participating in the economy, that the Bill should be as radical as possible.  Far from being radical, in many ways it is regressive and fails to move forward on the key commitments given in Partnership 2000 to create a more inclusive society and to ensure the benefits of economic growth are distributed more equitably. It also flies in the face of the commitments given in the national anti-poverty strategy under which the Government is to measure the impact of the budget initiatives on poverty.</P>
      <P>In more ways than one, the super rich in society were granted huge concessions in the budget at the request, no doubt, of the Progressive Democrats. These included the halving of the rate of capital gains tax.  Will the Minister indicate how this will help to redistribute the country's wealth among the disadvantaged, including those caught in poverty traps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Those on the Government side would be expected to speak highly of the Bill, particularly the increases in old age pensions.  We all accept, in and out of Government, that for those totally dependent on social welfare the increases are always inadequate.  It must be borne in mind that most of these are also dependent on local authority housing.  Most of the increases granted in social welfare payments are clawed back through the differential rent scheme administered by the local authorities.  This means, taking everything into account, that the total cost to the State is much reduced.  I am aware of the difficulties that can be created when one member of a household takes on the role of carer.  As the carer's allowance is taken into account in assessing household income, the differential rent payment is increased by as much as £4 or £5 per week.</P>
    <P>To comply with the terms of Partnership 2000 the Government had no option but to reach some of the levels recommended in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.  Despite the rhetoric, there has been no explanation of why the supplementary welfare allowance and the short-term rate of unemployment assistance are still well below the recommended levels.  All social welfare payments should be increased to a level above that recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare 12 years ago.  It is regrettable, at a time when the economy is booming and has been described as the Celtic tiger, that the inadequacies still have to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>The payments to which I referred are means tested.  The means test is rigid.  As a consequence, we have no option but to avail of the appeals process. Given the cost involved, a more flexible attitude should be adopted.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in adult dependant rates are lower than normal.  According to the calculations of the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, adult dependants will receive £1.20 per week less than they expected. That takes the good out of whatever increases were announced on budget day.  It was announced with a fanfare that all old age pensions would be increased by £5 and there would be a corresponding increase for adult dependants, but that is not the case.  Those who are not on the maximum rate of pension because they do not have the required contributions will receive less than the £5 per week increase to which those on the maximum rate of pension are entitled. Government Deputies who have contributed to this debate have heralded the increase in the old age pension, but they have remained tight-lipped about the increase of £1.50 in the dependency rate.  For a couple dependent on an old age pension the net gain under this budget is only in the region of £3.25 each.  In this age of equality adult dependants are not been treated as well as pensioners.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies and others have applauded changes in the calculation of the family income supplement, but we need to work harder to make that scheme applicable to as <Col N="1338" /> many people in low paid jobs as possible with as little bureaucracy as possible.  I welcome that change, small as it is, which the Government was committed to making under Partnership 2000. While this is a welcome change it is disappointing that it will not be introduced until October, unlike the haste that applied to the introduction of the capital gains tax concessions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the document Welfare to Work, did the budget make the journey harder with the Minister's application of the extended introduction date?  For a Government that had the good fortune to introduce a budget in the first week in December at a time when it had approximately £1,000 million to spend, it is regrettable it could not provide for the increases in those benefits earlier than October.  The Irish National Association of the Unemployed points out that delay will result in an income decrease for some families between April and October, particularly having regard to the cost of living index which signalled for that period an increase of more than 5 per cent.  Those changes, which will be of benefit when introduced, should have been made earlier to help those who depend on them.  That reduction will arise because of the punitive tax reform the Minister's colleague, Deputy McCreevy, announced in the December budget.</P>
    <P>We have heard very little today from Government Deputies about the proposal to introduce a public service card.  The provisions in the Bill are far from adequate in regard to restricting information exchanges and controlling the type of information on that card.  We do not want a public service card to be used solely as a form of identification by social welfare recipients because that would finger people on the margins of our society who have to depend on social welfare income.  They include the old, the infirm, the sick and the handicapped.  Those people would be identified by a public service card.  In principle we have no objection to the introduction of an identity card with a photograph.  We must also address the problem of underage drinking, underage smoking and other problems.  It would be a retrograde step to introduce that type of card only to identify social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The provision for carers is an improvement, but it is far from adequate.  Significant reform is required in regard to the means testing of carers. All Members would like to see an improvement in the application of that essential service into which my colleague has put so much work and which is so important throughout the country. That service has been very restrictive in its application. The means testing process is inflexible in taking account of many carers who have given up a normal livelihood or their work to look after elderly parents or an elderly person in the home. Given the cost of looking after an elderly person in a long-term institution or a nursing home, the carer's allowance represents great value for the State.  Having made some improvements to the scheme such as the provision of free travel for the recipients of the allowance, which will not be <Col N="1339" /> introduced until the end of the year if the Government is still in office at that time, I hope the Minister will continue to introduce as much flexibility into that scheme as possible because we all realise it is an essential service.  We know of the dedicated work of carers and the lack of respite care available to them.  If the Government is compassionate and the Oireachtas represents the compassion that should be shown in such sensitive areas, they will realise the carer's allowance is an issue that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The death grant has been £100 since the scheme was initiated.  Members, irrespective of whether in Opposition or Government, have urged the Department to have some regard for the cost of a burial.  The death grant of £100 would not cover the cost of paying a grave digger, never mind go some way towards covering the cost of a funeral which may cost £1,100, £1,200 or £1,400.  Also, the fuel allowance of £5 per week for the months October to April is not index linked despite the increased cost of fuel.  I and other Members, who have been campaigning for candidates in the forthcoming by-elections, are aware that people have asked for improvements in those areas.  The death grant and the fuel allowance help, but they should take account of increases in costs in those areas.</P>
    <P>Widows are the lowest paid category of social welfare recipients.  They are at their most vulnerable when they suffer the loss of their breadwinners. The Department of Social Welfare introduced the breadwinner's allowance, a six weeks payment following the death of a husband, to help widows cope with their loss.  Were it not for that small additional payment many widows, particularly those younger than 60, would not be able to pay their bills, especially those who were unprepared for the death of their spouse.  Widows under 60 are not entitled to allowances such as free telephone, free electricity and others benefits to which their husbands were entitled and they will not benefit from any of these peripheral improvements.  I ask the Minister to consider the dilemma faced by fairly young widows who will not qualify for those benefits.  We should consider paying a living alone allowance to any widow, particularly where a social welfare pension accounted for the total income in the household.</P>
    <P>I have stated on numerous occasions that I have a problem in regard to medical examinations, medical referees and the appeals system we have put in place to safeguard the Exchequer. The facilities available to medical doctors on the Department's list are not sufficient for them to make the judgment they are required to make. The judgment they make is based on their ability to give an opinion and once it is given it is extremely difficult to appeal it, despite medical evidence, consultants' evidence, hospital evidence and x-ray facilities.  The social welfare doctor may go to a location without facilities and give an opinion contrary to the medical evidence already on the record.  If the unfortunate applicant refers <Col N="1340" /> to particular evidence, that comment is frowned upon by the medical referee.  That is the only place I have found a lack of the user-friendliness which has become more evident in the Department over the years.</P>
    <P>We should base the examination on the fact that people have entitlements, not least because they have made contributions, and they require those entitlements in times of sickness.  I have no doubt that people who are fit, well and ready to go to work will want to be there.  However, we have penalised disability benefit so there is no incentive for someone to stay off if they are not ill.  I ask the Minister to ensure the Department becomes more user-friendly as regards medical examinations.  I hope he has the opportunity to reply before the vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Noel Ahern.  I pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for the manner in which the budget proposals as regards social welfare were presented.  I support the Bill and compliment the Minister on the forward thinking displayed in the legislation.  One would need a considerable length of time to reflect on the social welfare system but I will not be able to do that.  Suffice to say that the measure of a civilised society is the manner in which it treats the less well-off, and in this regard &mdash; this relates to the remarks of Deputy Ferris &mdash; the inadequacies in the system did not arise overnight.  While I agree with much that he said about the differences in payments and the other matters, these issues have been before many previous Governments.  If we do not take the steps necessary to bring innovative ideas into this House in the form of legislation, we will continue to deal with the system in an inadequate way and will keep the payments we have been used to over the years.  Previous speakers have commended the Minister on the various actions he has taken in the Bill, which underlines the Government's intent to deal with the overall problem and substantially to increase the payments.</P>
      <P>The key objectives set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium identify the areas which will need attention.  The first objective is to secure the future of our older people.  No future Government should be afraid to increase substantially payments to old age pensioners or other older people in our society.  The weekly increase of £5 and the commitment to raise the payment to £100 by 2002 is to be welcomed.  However, that is not to say this commitment should not be reviewed every year.  Given our booming economy, we should not be afraid to revise the commitment upwards.  That is essential if we are to be responsible towards those who helped build the country and committed their lives to Ireland.  We should not be afraid to repay them and to ensure that, in times of boom, the commitment to a payment of £100 is substantially increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second objective was to improve the real value of social welfare payments.  It is not good <Col N="1341" /> enough to increase a payment while another sector of Government takes the money back &mdash; for instance, to increase unemployment benefit and then to increase local authority rent, so that the recipient only enjoys the benefit of the increase for a few weeks.  We should give substantial increases and set out a timeframe in which to achieve our goal of recommended payments.  I would support the Government if it took this course of action.</P>
    <P>The third objective is to support people with disabilities and carers.  That case has been made by Deputies and while the changes are welcome there is a growing need to invest heavily in meeting the needs of those with disabilities.  While a substantial commitment has been made in this budget, much more is needed and it must be provided in such a way that it goes directly to the people who need it most.</P>
    <P>Bureaucracy can be a problem.  Our local branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association has applied for assistance in providing a day care centre and units for their members.  This application goes to a number of different Departments, but surely a method can be found whereby one Department can deal with the needs of the disabled and ensure the payments are made.  I ask the Government to consider drawing all the Departments together to ensure greater efficiency of spending in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill and the changes announced in the budget, especially the increases for pensioners.  Over the last four to five years, pensioners received miserable weekly increases of between £2.20 and £3.  I am glad the weekly increase this year will be £5. I hope and expect the increase will be at least that much over the next few years, to bring the payment to a decent level.  As we found out during last year's election, the elderly feel angry that the benefits of the Celtic tiger have not extended to them.  If the economy is better than it used to be, surely the elderly, who helped to build the system, should be among the first rather than the last to benefit.</P>
      <P>The budget and the Bill showed that much money went towards providing the extra £5 per week.  In other words, money was paid out in one large chunk rather than attempting to cover a lot of small items.  However, I was sad that the disregard figure in the fuel allowance was not increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were Minister, I would increase the difference in payments to contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners.  We are inclined to look at social welfare payments as hand out but people who receive contributory pensions have paid into their insurance fund over years of work and they should be able to profit from it.  The gap between contributory and non-contributory pensions is small and while it may be supplemented with an occupational pension, that may only be about £20 per week, and the contributory pensioner does not receive the fuel <Col N="1342" /> allowance.  We should always encourage people who work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris mentioned the £100 death grant, which is another example of a benefit which people paid towards and which is being eroded every year.  People who paid into the scheme all their lives receive only £100, whereas those who did not pay can go to their local clinic and receive £500 without any difficulty.  These contributory benefits are being belittled and we should boost them as time passes.  The fuel allowance is the big issue because many people who receive a small pension of £20 per week do not get the allowance. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, I was told it would cost only £160,000 to increase the disregard threshold for the allowance to £20 per week.  It should be possible to find that amount of money in the Department.</P>
    <P>Fraud has been mentioned.  The Department issued a press release a few weeks ago in which it spoke about the couple of hundred million pounds it saved last year.  It referred to the savings it made in regard to unemployment, pensions, PRSI, child benefit, pre-retirement payments, supplementary welfare, family income supplement and so on.  It mentioned everything except the lone parent's allowance, which we know is the biggest rip-off of all time.  Genuine lone parents, male or female, must be looked after by the State.  However, we all know that a large percentage of those claiming lone parent's allowance are not lone parents.  It is extraordinary that, despite the Department's hype about all it has saved, lone parent's allowance did not feature in the statistics.  I would like a clampdown on all abuse, with the money saved being directed to those most in need.</P>
    <P>The changes in family income supplement, child benefit and benefit for twins are very welcome. A number of speakers mentioned the carer's allowance.  It is a very good scheme which has been extended over the past few years to include more people.  However, many people are still not included in that scheme.  The Minister said recently the Department is conducting a study on that matter.  However, it must extend beyond the Department.  As long as the scheme is means tested, it will not reach many of those who care for elderly relatives.  The Department must include the Department of Health and Children in this scheme.  Many carers would regard even £20 or £25 a week as a recognition of their efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the improvements in social welfare payments which were announced in the budget.  It also provides for the introduction of a unique public service identifier, a public service card, and the sharing of certain information for determining entitlement to income related services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It provides for the increases in social insurance payments of £5 in the weekly personal rate of those payments where the beneficiary is 66 years of age and over, or in the case of retirement and <Col N="1343" /> invalidity pensions where the beneficiary is 65 years and over.  All other personal rates of social insurance payments are being increased by £3 per week.  The payments in respect of qualified adults are being increased by approximately 3 per cent. Similar increases in payments for social assistance recipients are also provided.  All these increases will be payable in the first week in June, two weeks earlier than last year.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases in child benefit of £1.50 for the first two children and £3 for each subsequent child, bringing the monthly rate of child benefit to £31.50 and £42, respectively.  It also introduces improvements in respect of multiple births.  The rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins will be 1.5 times the rate payable for a single child.  Also, the grants payable in respect of multiple births are being aligned, so that all multiple births will receive a grant of £500 on birth, and further grants of £500 at the age of four and 12 years.  All these improvements will be effective from September 1998.</P>
    <P>For the first time, FIS will be assessed on a net basis, that is, gross income less superannuation, income tax and PRSI.  This improvement satisfies the commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate entitlement to FIS on the basis of net earnings.  It also strengthens the link between FIS and employment.  This improvement will come into force on 1 October 1998.  In addition, a general increase of £7 will apply to the weekly thresholds for the calculation of entitlement to FIS from June 1998.  As a result, all current recipients will automatically benefit by at least £4 per week.</P>
    <P>Among the more radical provisions of the Bill is the introduction of a platform for the development of information technology across the public service.  The first of these new provisions is for the extended use of the revenue and social insurance number.  At present, the RSI number may only be used as an identifier number by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.  The new section 223 will provide that the RSI number will become a personal public service number and may be used by certain specified bodies.  Those bodies are Departments, local authorities, health boards, the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, An Post, the General Register Office and the Legal Aid Board, and by the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces for administration in relation to their own members.  There is provision to prescribe other bodies, but any such addition would be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The use and disclosure of a personal public service number is limited to the person to whom the number refers, any of the bodies listed above, a person or body who has a transaction with one of the listed bodies where the number is relevant to that transaction, or certain control provisions in social welfare legislation.  It is anticipated that the use of the PPS number will occur gradually across the public service.  The extension of this unique <Col N="1344" /> public service identifier will assist individuals in their personal dealings with various public service organisations.</P>
    <P>Another new provision is the extension of the current social services card to reflect the extended use of the RSI/PPS number.  This new card will be known as the public service card.  The person's name, PPS number and primary account number, in other words, the card identifier number, will be visible on the card, and such information as prescribed in regulations will be electronically coded on to it.  These regulations shall be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that anyone may at any time request a copy of the information encoded on his or her card.  There is no provision for a visible photograph on the card and it will not be an identity card <i>per se.</i>  An individual will only be obliged to use the card in the transaction of personal business with specified bodies.  It will assist those bodies by ensuring the identity of a customer, particularly if, as is anticipated, the card will contain more information about the person in future, for example, spouse's name.  The electronically encoded information may only be read by computers specifically programmed for that task.  The public service card will be a permanent record of an individual's PPS number and may assist the provision of services, such as remote claim registration.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation also provides for the introduction of a payment card for social welfare payments.  This measure is included to facilitate the future development of social welfare payment methods.  It is anticipated that in the foreseeable future such payments may be made through banks, ATMs or even retail outlets.  As with the public service card, encoding of information on to the card will be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The individual will have a right to request details of the information encoded on his or her card.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the sharing of information, on the basis of the personal public service number, between specified public bodies for the purpose of determining entitlement to certain income related social services.  The services to which the data sharing relate are social welfare schemes; income supports administered by the Department of Health and Children, for example, domiciliary care allowances; medical card services; differential rent schemes administered by local authorities; higher education grants; and civil legal aid.  The sharing of information will be subject to the approval of data controllers in the relevant organisations.  The benefits arising from the sharing of information will be the need to capture the information only once, thus making the claim process more efficient and effective, and the prevention of fraud.</P>
    <P>The provision includes severe penalties for anyone breaching the legislation regarding the use of a personal public service number, public service card or payment card, or anyone transferring <Col N="1345" /> information without the appropriate authority. These provisions are the first step in the implementation of the interdepartmental report on the integrated social services system, published in August 1996.  The proposals contained in this Bill are only the initial stages in the production of a more comprehensive and cohesive social service system.</P>
    <P>Another radical provision is the amendment to the recovery procedures in relation to social welfare payments.  It provides for the recovery of money wrongfully received by a person from that person's current or future social welfare payments, and avoids unnecessary recourse to the courts.  Previously the Department had to proceed with either criminal or civil litigation to recoup money in certain cases, even where the person concerned admitted liability.  Under this provision a person who admits liability may repay the money wrongfully received by a deduction from weekly social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this is an innovative and radical Bill, providing for a substantial increase in payments, including major changes in family income supplement.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard. The movement towards net income will make a vast difference.  It is something for which all Members of the House have been calling for some time.  It took a Minister of the quality of the present Minister to introduce this major and very substantial change.  This Bill has as its basis the introduction of a framework for sound public administration for the next millennium.  I compliment the Minister and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gormley, Burke and Ó Caoláin, in that order.</P>
      <P>I wish to address myself initially to the decision of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to pay arrears to late applicants for old age contributory pensions, retirement, widow's, widower's and orphan's contributory pensions. All who contribute to a pension fund are entitled to their pension once they become eligible for it. The State is the only institution that requires the eligible candidate to apply for a benefit to which they have contributed and who deny the person their right if they do not go through this procedure of filling up forms.  The Department has all the information on file and should automatically forward pensions to the people who are entitled to them.  Nobody should be in a position where, as a late applicant, they do not get their full entitlement.  The Minister has a duty, in the interest of fair play to the people who paid for the benefit, to pay arrears from the date from which they are due and to automatically pay all those eligible for contributory benefits as soon as they become eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently announced that in l997 legislation was enacted providing for backdating late claims for up to 12 months and that the new <Col N="1346" /> regulations provide for further backdating to give a proportion of the arrears where claims are not more than 12 months late.  For example, a claim made two years after the date of entitlement may be backdated for 18 months.  A claim which is five years late may be backdated for almost two and a half years.  Claims over five years late may get 10 per cent of the amount due over the period. The Minister allows the regulations to apply only to all new claims and claims made from 1 January l997.  The decision of the Minister to restrict payment of arrears is unfair to those who worked throughout their lives and contributed to their pension and who, because of an administrative lapse, are not entitled to payment.  I ask the Minister to consider the injustice of the situation.  A person who has contributed over 30 or 40 years to a benefit should be paid that benefit.  The State has budgeted for it and it should be paid in full from the date of entitlement.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to re-examine the position of the self-employed who have been paying PRSI since l988 and to consider giving those who have paid 90 per cent of their contributions towards a full pension a <i>pro rata</i> payment of 90 per cent of their pension.  Over the years most public representatives have received many representations on this matter.  At present people who have paid 90 per cent of their contributions will get only a partial refund.  They should be paid 90 per cent of their pension.</P>
    <P>In l997 there was a problem relating to people coming off social employment schemes who are in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Many people taking part in social employment schemes were assured by FÁS and by the State that they would lose no benefits when they came off the social employment scheme.  Many of them lost benefit, including their Christmas bonus, last year.  Many who would have been eligible if on unemployment assistance for the dependency rate in respect of third level education are not now entitled to that because they are on unemployment benefit.  They were entitled to those benefits before they went on the social employment scheme.  They are not now entitled to them.  The Minister should examine that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the inflexibility of the means test relating to the carer's allowance, let me give the example of the case of a constituent who for many years has been caring for parents and who has been in receipt of a carer's allowance.  That person gave up their life to look after their parents but, when they put up a bed and breakfast sign, their carer's allowance was reduced by £4. That person was shocked at their treatment by the State because they got involved in something other than just caring, to which they had and continue to devote their life.  That is inhuman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget presented by the Minister for Finance will be remembered as the budget which significantly widened the gap between rich and poor.  At a time when the coffers were overflowing, when the Celtic tiger was <Col N="1347" /> roaring, when the Minister enjoyed unprecedented latitude, he chose to reward the rich. Nothing indicates that better than the halving of capital gains tax.  Surely this was pandering to the rich and the privileged, those who perhaps contribute to the political parties.  That is highly regrettable and it has been highlighted by everybody on the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the budget and aspects of the Social Welfare Bill which I welcome.  It would be churlish not to.  I welcome in particular the family income supplement, the increases in old age pensions, the travel pass for those in receipt of a carer's allowance.  Also the focus on disability, however small, is to be welcomed, and the fact that the recommendations on the minimum levels of social welfare payments, as put forward by the Commission on Social Welfare, have now been reached, albeit 12 years after they were recommended.  All of that has to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, the central issue is the widening gap between rich and poor.  The Conference of Religious in Ireland in their budget analysis highlighted this in a significant way when they said that the gap between rich and poor had grown by a massive £526 in the case of a couple on long-term unemployment assistance and a couple on £20,000 per annum.  That is a statistic which should make the Minister feel a little guilty.  If that does not make him feel guilty, the measly increase of 5p per day in child benefit should at least prick his conscience.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker, and others, referred to inflexibility regarding the carer's allowance.  We are all aware of such cases in our constituencies. It is excessively harsh to require people who are barely able to survive to undergo a means test. These people save the State a huge amount of money by looking after their loved ones at home. The burdens and stress on carers can be extreme and they are carrying out a labour of love.  The Government is treating these people with contempt and I ask it to examine the matter in more detail.  We are repeatedly told that this is the beginning of the process and that the matter will be dealt with further in future Finance Bills.</P>
      <P>The INOU and the Data Protection Agency have expressed reservations about the introduction of an identity card and have asked for the matter to be dealt with in a separate Bill.  If we head down the road towards identity cards we may be witnessing the erosion of civil liberties. We need to be extremely cautious about this proposal and I ask the Minister to look at it in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When talking about innovation, which is required when dealing with social welfare, one must consider the introduction of a guaranteed basic income.  This concept has been advocated by the Green Party since its inception and is supported by the Conference of Religious in Ireland. The scheme was looked at in the context of Partnership 2000.  There was a good debate on the matter in the House and I think Fine Gael would <Col N="1348" /> pursue the concept if returned to Government.  I hope a future coalition Government of Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left and perhaps the Green Party will vigorously pursue the introduction of this concept.  A guaranteed basic income is work friendly.  It also eliminates poverty and poverty traps, promotes equity and ensures everyone receives an income.  We should all be striving to achieve these aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>My party is very disappointed at the inadequacy of the social welfare provisions.  We are being asked to agree meagre increases for the 750,000 social welfare recipients. During the past four years of unprecedented economic growth the gap between the incomes of a long-term unemployed couple and a couple earning an annual salary of £20,000 has increased by £2,214 per year.  Figures recently published by the Department of Finance show that the number of people earning over £100,000 per year more than doubled over the same period.</P>
      <P>The Government has squandered the opportunity provided by the Bill to narrow the poverty gap.  Taken together with the tax changes introduced by the Government, the main beneficiaries of which were the better off, these social welfare measures serve to widen the gulf between wealth and disadvantage.  Despite all the hype about helping people to move from welfare to work, the reality for tens of thousands of people is a choice between a tenuous and demoralising existence on social welfare or a low paid job with bad conditions and no security.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs assured us that there is nothing sinister in the proposed identity card.  However, the full civil liberties implications of this have not been explored.  This is a major and significant development which has barely been examined by way of public debate.  As the Minister's case is not proven, I cannot support it.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to increase the weekly income threshold from £150 to £200 so that more people can qualify for a carer's allowance.  Those who provide this invaluable service are due the most generous consideration possible.  Like the rest of the budget provisions, the Bill will be regarded as one of the greatest lost opportunities in the history of government.  Accordingly, I register my strong rejection of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will carry out a review of the social welfare system in the very near future.  The numerous social welfare schemes are confusing and in some cases deny people their entitlements.  The Minister must take the brave step of reviewing the system before it becomes a maze.  A person should be employed on a full-time basis by the Department to make information available to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, too many people depend on social welfare.  While all social welfare increases are welcome, they are never sufficient.  It is very difficult for a family to exist on social welfare <Col N="1349" /> alone.  Allowances such as the free fuel allowance are a help but they only enable families to exist. They do not give them a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not implemented the Ombudsman's recommendation that people who did not apply in time should be paid the full pension to which they are entitled?  While the Department is paying a portion of this, it is not sufficient.  Self-employed people who paid their contributions for eight or nine years are now being denied a full pension.  I have raised with the Department the possibility of allowing a person's spouse to continue paying the contributions which could be taken into account in calculating the overall contribution.  I have not received a response from the Department and I ask the Minister to say if this is possible.</P>
    <P>I agree that the carer's allowance should not be means tested.  Carers who look after people at home save the State much money and I ask the Minister to consider exempting them from means testing.  The continuous means testing of social welfare recipients is not necessary and it should be possible to have one means test every two or three years.  All of the necessary information is readily available now on computer and it can be easily updated rather than having to go through the whole process of reassessment on a continuous basis, despite the fact that there might be only a moderate change of means.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Gormley's suggestion that to include the new section 223, which standardises the revenue and social insurance number, would be a denial of civil liberties.  It should be used as a key national identifier for all. After all, most students, even some as young as 12, get recognition through an RSI number.  It is a good idea and to include it as a national identifier does not encroach on any civil liberty.</P>

      <P>Already there is a split between the new rainbow coalition on the opposite side.  Deputy Gormley mentioned there could be a four party coalition and already there is disagreement within less than five minutes.  It is an unusual situation.  I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on bringing to the House his first Bill, which fulfils the commitments given by my party and in the Government programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown real commitment to social welfare improvements by committing £125 million in 1998, which will amount to £225 million in a full year.  We gave a commitment in the programme for Government to spend £525 million over a three year period on social inclusion.  This figure will be exceeded in a two year period.  In my eight months in the Dáil I have seen the programme for Government wagged on several occasions in this House, but I have seen no waving of the programme for Government during this debate.  I gather this is as a result of our honouring our commitment to the people in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> This is the largest budget package for years.  It represents £11 billion.  It is 9 per cent higher than the increase put forward by the previous Administration. I want to dwell on three issues in this Bill in the time available to me: the increase in social welfare payments, the improvements in the family income supplement and the measure to ease the means test for certain social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>We stated in the programme for Government that we would increase to £100 per week the contributory old age pension over a five year period. This commitment has been honoured with an increase of £5 per week in maximum rates, proportionately reduced for those who are not in receipt of the maximum amount.  This represents an increase of between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent.  As a result of this change introduced by the Minister, 94 per cent of the people who rely on weekly social welfare payments will receive more than the minimum rate of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  That was a commitment in the programme for Government and I wish the Opposition Deputies could have brought that programme into the House today so that at least the people would recognise we are honouring it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes the Minister introduced to family income supplement in the Bill.  It is the first time that FIS will be assessed on a net basis. This is a very important move.  It is another commitment in the programme on which the Government has delivered.  It gives an incentive to the unemployed to take up work and to the employed to stay in work.  The FIS will encourage employment. This is already evident in the reduction in the number of people claiming unemployment assistance.  This improvement in the FIS scheme will bring 1,600 families into the scheme in 1998 and 7,000 families in a full year.  I also welcome the £7 per week increase in the weekly threshold in calculating FIS.</P>
    <P>A very important development has occurred in the past few days in relation to the easing of the means test for certain schemes, and I compliment the Minister on it.  It is a significant improvement in means testing for those, particularly in County Mayo, in the REP scheme or the new SAC scheme which is to be introduced by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The position to date was that the first £2,000 of a REPS payment was disregarded in assessing means for unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age non-contributory pension.  The new amendment by the Minister means that the remaining income from these schemes will only be assessed at 50 per cent. Therefore, a farmer who is receiving a REPS payment of £4,000 will be £1,000 better off under this amendment, and I welcome that.  It means a great deal to low income farmers from north County Mayo in my constituency.  It would be great to see a disregard of £2,000 across the board, not just for those receiving payments under REPS and <Col N="1351" /> the SAC scheme.  I ask the Minister to consider this in the future.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks, it has been brought to my attention that social welfare officers are carrying out inspections and assessments all over County Mayo, but particularly in north Mayo.  I recognise that they have a job to do and I understand fully the commitment they have to their job. However, the level of income which a farmer in my constituency derives from having five cows is not the same as that which could be derived in all other counties, yet one level of assessment appears to be used.  To get a vet to visit a farm in north Mayo may involve a journey of 20 or 30 miles.  The land is much poorer and requires more fertiliser.  There is no way one would generate the same level of income there as that which a farmer might generate in a wealthier part of the country. I regard the Minister's measure to ease the means test as a significant first step in this regard, and I ask him to examine this other matter in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on the changes he has introduced for carers and those which relate to PRSI.  This Bill is a significant honouring of our commitment in the programme for Government and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  While I might not agree with everything they have said, I appreciate the comments from the Opposition benches.  I thank the Deputies who wished me well.  I thank the officials who spent long hours preparing this legislation in my Department.  I also thank those who made constructive comments outside the House.  They may or may not have been happy with some aspects of the Bill, but I appreciate that we live in a democracy and they are entitled to make their views known.  Obviously in so far as we can we will take on board views, but at the end of the day it is the duty of Government to govern and make decisions on issues on which it feels it is appropriate to act.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe suggested in his contribution that the social affairs committee could meet a number of groups.  That is entirely a matter for the committee.  It may well contribute to a better understanding of what is involved in this.  He and a number of other Deputies referred to the fact that over a number of years that issue was progressed by several Governments.  I will refer to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taken with Deputy O'Keeffe's comment that he would like to have congratulated me on this, my first, Bill.  His heart is in the right place. I am not surprised that he expressed extreme disappointment with the Bill.  He would say that anyway, would he not?  I thought his tongue was firmly in his cheek when he made his contribution. Prior to the budget I recall him making some well trumpeted suggestions as to what should be done in the forthcoming budget.  I was <Col N="1352" /> happy to accede to many of the requests he made at that time, although he stole our thunder to a certain extent.  He and other Deputies suggested we should give £5 to old age pensioners, not thinking that we would come anywhere near that limit, but they were proved wrong.  That has been conveniently forgotten by those who criticised the budget.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to us since coming into office, the Government made a conscious decision to assist people over the age of 66 in this area.  Approximately 300,000 people will be in receipt of £5 per week for 52 weeks.  That is a considerable sum when one takes into account the fact that the previous Government did not come near that figure in any of its budgets.  The former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, gave an increase of 2.5 per cent in his first budget when inflation was approximately 2.5 per cent.  In succeeding years he was unable to match the real increase above the rate of inflation that we gave in this budget.  People should acknowledge the fact that a substantial effort was made to assist a section of our community which perhaps is not as well organised as some of the more vocal groups in our society.  These people will receive an additional £5 per week, an increase which ranges from 6.4 per cent to 7.4 per cent.  Given that inflation is somewhere in the region of 2 per cent, that is an excellent increase and goes further that we originally suggested in our programme for Government in which we said we would increase the old age contributory pension to £100 over the five year period of the programme.</P>
    <P>With the exception of two items, the rates of payment are now more than the rates suggested by the Commission on Social Welfare.  We are ahead of schedule in that regard because certain commitments were given in Partnership 2000 and we were able to go a long way in this budget.  It is accepted by the people who were in this Department before me that many good deeds were done in this budget and I hope that can be continued.</P>
    <P>The package attained in this budget, part of which this Bill refers to, represents an increase of 125 per cent which is by far the best budget package for many years.  I have the figures if anybody wants to see them.  I do not say this as a criticism, I am merely making a point, but in an election year the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, attained a budget package of £113 million.  We have gained an additional £11 million, a 9 per cent increase, and that has been distributed to the people we believe are most in need of it.  I do not accept the criticism that has been made.  I accept we may have wanted to do more in certain areas but every Minister will say that.  We made a conscious decision in our first budget to assist people over the age of 66 who have contributed to our society.  It is time to return the favour to those people.</P>
    <P>Approximately 566,000 other recipients will receive an increase of £3.  That is a better increase than anything given by the rainbow coalition <Col N="1353" /> Government during its time in office.  That is a 4.2 per cent average increase with the rate of inflation at approximately 2 per cent.  I would expect people to acknowledge that but perhaps I am being a little naive.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's perpetual tone of outrage and disappointment makes him an ideal candidate for the job of Ireland's rugby coach.  Given the day that is in it, he might give it up at least until after Easter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised significant issues with which I will try to deal.  One of those concerns self-employed people who were over the age of 56 in 1988 when compulsory insurance was introduced.  Deputies will appreciate that it had been a feature of the old age contributory pension scheme, since its introduction in 1961, that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age in order to link entitlement to a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund.  The whole tenet of social insurance is that there should be a reasonable level of contributions.  Deputies should also note that any self-employed persons who had been insured as employed contributors prior to the age of 56 could combine the contributions in order to qualify for old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the Social Welfare Act provided for refunds to be payable to any person who has such combined insurance but does not qualify for a contributory pension.  That was an acknowledgement by the outgoing Government that there was a difficulty in this area but it was unable to address that thorny issue which I will thoroughly examine to see if anything can be done.  This is an extremely difficult and costly area.</P>
    <P>Many self-employed people will also benefit from the new <i>pro rata</i> pensions I introduced last November, although I am concerned that the broadest possible contributory pension cover should apply to as many people as possible.  I have asked my officials to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in 1988.  I expect a report on this examination in the next few weeks, although my Department estimates that the additional cost of paying contributory old age pension to this group would be in the order of £50 million per annum or a capitalised cost of £475 million over the full period of the payments.  When one contrasts that £50 million per annum with a budget package of £125 million, it indicates the type of cost with which we must deal.  This and any other options put forward would therefore include a substantial cost and would only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said very little is being done in the context of the Bill to promote a welfare to work approach.  I remind the Deputy of a number of important measures I indicated in my budget speech, which I accept was more comprehensive than my speech today, when I outlined my vision for this Department.  For example, in this Bill we implemented a commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate FIS on a net income basis from next <Col N="1354" /> October.  We will also increase the weekly income thresholds by £7 per week at each point from next June.  The number of places on the back to work allowance scheme will be increased by 5,000 and we are also giving an additional year's payment to self-employed people on the back to work allowance scheme, a measure that is very much appreciated.  We also intend to introduce a revamped back to education programme.</P>
    <P>These measures, along with those introduced by the Minister for Finance relating to a special tax allowance of £3,000 and £1,000 for each child for long-term unemployed people who take up a job, and a double deduction for wages for employers, are excellent initiatives to encourage people to return to the workplace. Last year, expenditure on the employment support services in my Department amounted to £97.5 million.  This year I am providing an additional £38 million to assist people to re-enter the workplace.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised child income support issues.  In recent years child income support policy has been driven by the need to ensure the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  There is widespread agreement that child benefit, as opposed to increasing child dependant allowance, is the most effective mechanism for the provision of child income support for a number of reasons. A number of speakers said that child dependant allowance has not been increased, but that is a definite policy that has been continued from the previous Government.  It is more beneficial as an incentive to work to increase child benefit, and my predecessors in this office will acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>In the context of the criticisms in terms of child benefit, last year's budget provided £32.89 million for child income support via child benefit and FIS.  In this year's budget £38.27 million was provided for child income support.  In child benefit alone, the increase in expenditure is more than £3 million more than that provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised issues concerning carers and the carer's allowance.  There is not a Deputy here who is more appreciative than I am of the enormous contribution made by carers, and more committed to improving their position. My Department, in conjunction with other Departments and carers' groups, is carrying out a very extensive review of the carer's allowance and related issues.  I do not intend to pre-empt the findings of that review and that consultation process.  In my budget speech last December I gave a commitment to bring forward a range of measures in next year's budget in light of the review, and I will honour that commitment.  In view of the concerns expressed by the carers' association, which I met recently, today I announced a relaxation of the full-time care requirement to allow carers to get out and about. This will be facilitated by the award of the free travel pass to all carers, as announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> Deputy De Rossa questioned the current status of the national anti-poverty strategy and the Government's commitment to it.  Significant progress is being made in that regard.  The Government is fully committed to establishing an inclusive society as part of our action programme and to implement the national anti-poverty strategy. The Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs meets on a regular basis to bring forward issues concerning the national anti-poverty strategy, local development and the fight against drugs.  There are only two Cabinet sub-committees &mdash; the other concerns Northern Ireland &mdash; which gives a clear indication of the Government's commitment and the Taoiseach's personal determination in this area.  Arising from the work of this committee, the youth services fund of £30 million was recently announced and money committed, which was not done by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies, particularly Deputies O'Keeffe and De Rossa, who spoke in favour of the proposals to introduce a public service-social service number and card.  This initiative was brought forward, and supported, by the previous Government on foot of reports that were available. In contrast with the attitude of Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and the Labour Party, both Deputies were honest enough to support, in Opposition, a proposal which they and their parties supported in Government.  I am implementing a necessary initiative.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify some key points in this regard. The public service card is not and will not operate as an identity card.  I have specifically provided <Col N="1356" /> that it will be a criminal offence for a person to incorrectly use or attempt to use a public service card.  It is not confined to welfare recipients but will extend to all people who have contact with a range of public services, for example, taxpayers. Information can be provided to the Garda, not to the general public, in regard to its dealings with members.  The operation of the system will be subject to very tight limitations laid down by sections 14 and 15 and fully in line with the data protection legislation.  I look forward to a constructive debate on these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The public service number is an important platform for the development of an integrated social service system.  It will be used by public service agencies regardless of whether data sharing will be permissible and will avoid cost and confusion involved in the issue and maintenance of multiple identifiers across Government agencies.  The public service card is a simple and convenient way of communicating the number to the individual and for the individual to communicate the number when accessing public services.  It may be visibly presented or swiped through a card reader.  It is currently issued at the age of 16 for tax and PRSI purposes.</P>
    <P>The key issue in regard to data sharing relates to the protection of the individual's privacy.  The Bill states that the data can be shared only for the purpose of determining entitlement to or control of income support services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is opportunistic legislation introduced by a cynical and exploitative party.  It has nothing to do with workers' rights, fair play and social partnership. This is an attempt by the Labour Party and its spokesperson, Deputy Broughan, to exploit the difficulties of the Ryanair workers for their political gain.  This Bill will not resolve the Ryanair dispute or any similar dispute in the future.  This Bill is not about alleviating the problems of some unfortunate workers on strike pay, it is about giving false hope to those workers in the hope that the unsuspecting public will believe the Labour Party cares.</P>
      <P>If the House were foolish enough to pass the Bill it would set back industrial relations by decades.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil led the way in building social partnership which has been the cornerstone in the process of fostering economic growth and increased employment.  It is interesting to note that the only real threat to that partnership approach came in the time that Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in Government, the same parties which most derided the approach when Fianna Fáil first introduced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to cast aside the model of voluntary social partnership in favour of an adversarial and coercive approach.  The measures <Col N="1359" /> proposed can only increase confrontation and industrial unrest.  The result will not be better working conditions, but fewer jobs as investors look with horror at unworkable legislation disrupting productivity and trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan claimed to have consulted widely on all sides in industry.  Having examined the Bill, the only evidence I can find is that he copied widely.  The Bill is a hotchpotch of measures which have already proved unworkable in other jurisdictions.  Employers faced with the terms of this legislation will have little option but to take their cases to the courts here and in Europe.  The outcome of these cases will do little to enhance workers rights or conditions.</P>
    <P>The loose and careless language of the Bill has great potential for enhancing the income of the legal profession.  Imagine the fun our bewigged friends in the Law Library would have debating what is meant by &ldquo;a substantial number of employees&rdquo; in the context of this Bill.  After days of debating thus in the High Court they would deserve to unwind in the Shelbourne Bar.  They might decide to name a corner of it after Deputy Broughan in gratitude.  Fortunately, that will not happen because I do not doubt that the House will reject the Bill which is little more than an ill conceived publicity stunt.</P>
    <P>I believe in trade unionism, a belief I am sure I share with the majority of Deputies.  Without the strength of collective bargaining workers would never have achieved the significant rights and protections they enjoy.  Trade unionists have led the way in rights for women, the disabled and the disadvantaged.  Although I believe in trade unionism, I believe less in the trade unions and, in particular, their high profile leaders.</P>

      <P>If the passion supposedly driving this Bill were in evidence Opposition Members would be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I believe less and less in the high profile leaders of the trade unions.  Last year an ordinary member of a union dared to challenge for high office and it sent shock waves through <Col N="1360" /> the union establishment.  Challenging the <i>status quo</i> is not the badge of honour it was in the past in the labour movement.  Dissatisfaction among ordinary members at the cosy cartels in the upper echelons of the unions resulted in the close vote on the Partnership 2000 agreement.  I welcome that union members are challenging those arrangements.</P>
    <P>If, traditionally, the membership was the union, the branch secretary was the authentic voice of that membership.  The best branch secretaries are the opposite of good children &mdash; they are heard and not seen.  However, nowadays we are seeing the phenomenon of the television star branch secretary and I doubt if this is to the advantage of the union members.  A Member of the House who had us on the edge of our seats awaiting revelations that would have shaken the State to its foundations may have been the first television age branch secretary.  With these branch secretaries television visibility and politics are more important apparently than workers and their jobs. How much have high visibility struggles benefited the workers of Veha or will they benefit the workers of Ryanair?</P>

      <P>They cannot have been impressed that the Deputy was not in the Chamber for the opening of the debate.</P>
      <P>We were rocked to our foundations again this week with a challenge from Deputy Rabbitte to Ryanair to deny that it was to contract out its baggage handling.  Within an hour the chief executive of Ryanair had taken up the challenge and unequivocally denied the allegation.  This got Deputy Rabbitte on the news but I do not understand what it achieved for the Ryanair workers. The vast majority of branch secretaries work hard for their members and in my experience they work above and beyond the hours for which they are paid.  I expect these men and women share many of the concerns I have expressed.</P>
      <P>A cornerstone of Partnership 2000 was the promotion of partnership in the public and private sectors.  In researching this Bill Deputy Broughan obviously read that document.  Partnership 2000 established a national centre for partnership to facilitate trust and partnership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between employers, employees and unions.  That could be thrown aside if we adopt Deputy Broughan's approach. I understand a report is being prepared for the Tánaiste on the issue of trade union recognition <Col N="1361" /> and I hope this report will put forward realistic recommendations for resolving such disputes through negotiation and mediation.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Ryanair baggage handlers at Dublin airport are on strike because Ryanair will not allow SIPTU to represent them.  The workers' case is clear and easily understood.  Ryanair uses professional negotiators in their dealing with the workers.  Why are the workers not entitled to use professional negotiators?  Ryanair has responded by setting out a detailed case expressing its concerns at the effect union recognition would have on its business.  If I were to make a judgment I would side with the workers.  However, that is not the point at issue in this Bill and it is not for me to decide the matter.  The workers and the company must resolve their differences.  Significant industrial relations machinery is in place to assist the parties in this regard and it is in this respect that I have concerns about the attitude of Ryanair management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would vote for a Bill that would do something but the Deputy knows this is nonsense.  Ryanair was wrong to refuse a Labour Court offer to mediate in the dispute and such an attitude can only prolong the dispute and ultimately lead to residual bitterness when the matter is finally settled.  One of the saddest aspects of industrial disputes is that they are ultimately settled and often on terms that should have been attained at the start of the dispute.  Prolonging disputes by unnecessary and unrealistic stubbornness is unfair to workers and their families and flies in the face of proper industrial relations.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Winners and losers&rdquo; is not the language of successful business and is not the right approach but neither is coercion.  I do not commend the Bill to the House as it is a recipe for industrial chaos. I reiterate my distaste for the exploitive and opportunistic nature of this proposal.  Far from championing the cause of workers, the Labour Party is using them as usual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the general provisions of the Bill.  Nevertheless, there must be trade union recognition by Ryanair.  The workers, including the baggage handlers, have a fundamental right to be professionally represented by the trade union of their choice.  The dispute is <Col N="1362" /> unseemly with national implications, especially for the principle of social partnership.  In 1987, Fianna Fáil pioneered successive partnership programmes and it seems all parties now subscribe to this philosophy.  All subscribe, though some of them were late converts, to the concept of consensus and social partnership.  Indeed, Deputy Bruton, when in Opposition previously, gave the impression he did not agree with the concept but, thankfully, he enthusiastically embraced the philosophy upon becoming Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Since 1986 the Government and the social partners have brought forward several programmes for the development of the economy and this has led to unprecedented rates of economic growth. The Irish model of social partnership and consensus has been extremely successful and the trade union movement has played a crucial role in the process.  The movement is healthy, which is in contrast to the position in other European countries. Trade unions are a crucial part of economic and social life and have made an enormous contribution to Ireland's development over the years.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless the Bill would damage the process of collective bargaining and the voluntarism which is the basis of industrial relations in Ireland.  In its present form the Bill could have serious consequences for the industrial relations process and for the concept of social partnership as a whole.  The system in general &ldquo;ain't broke&rdquo; and, therefore, there is no need to fix it. However, there is a serious problem in Ryanair. The company has been a success story since its establishment 12 years ago and its workers have played an important part in bringing about this success.  It has made air travel more accessible and cheaper.  Today Ryanair is a profitable company and workers must benefit from these increased profits.</P>
      <P>The company has been assisted by the Government and taxpayers in many different ways.  Information was provided to the House yesterday on the extent of that assistance.  Until the end of 1994 it received tourism marketing grants totalling over £1 million under operational programmes for tourism.  FÁS provided over £45,000 between 1991 and 1993 and a further £120,000 in 1993 and 1994 under the jobs training scheme.  It was announced in late 1996 that Ryanair, in the form of its subsidiary Ryanair Direct, would receive assistance of £2 million between 1997 and 1999 from Forbairt.  In addition, the value of discounts availed of by the company at Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports between 1989 and 1994 was also provided to the House yesterday &mdash; £0.5 million in 1989; £0.86 million in 1990; £1.2 million in 1991; £1.99 million in 1992; £1.92 million in 1993 and £2.08 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>Ryanair must adopt a spirit of co-operation and social partnership now that is has come of age and behave similarly to any other successful company. I fully agree with the Taoiseach's remarks at the Cork Chamber of Commerce annual dinner on February 13.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> I do not believe that a tooth and claw style capitalism is the direction in which most people want the Celtic Tiger to go.  We need a real impetus on both sides to engage in real dialogue with third party help offered by the State if that is required.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret Ryanair declined the invitation of the Labour Court.  It is a respected forum where issues could have been clarified and the facts of the dispute determined.  I urge the company to accept third party help and adopt the partnership route even at this late stage and ask it to accept the offer from the Labour Court.  This is a serious issue of principle and all Members must have a view on it because of its wide ranging potential ramifications for partnership and our industrial relations mechanism generally.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is a staunch trade unionist and I wish to take RTE to task for giving him such coverage in this evening's news bulletin where he made scurrilous allegations about the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment misleading the House.  He was a Minister in the Department during his tenure in Government and had a seat at Cabinet.  It has been in the public domain for many years that offshore non-resident companies have been and are used for tax evasion and money laundering. It is not only since Deputy Mary Harney became Minister that this information has come into the hands of the Department.  Sunday newspapers in Ireland and England have printed exposés on the misuse of UK and Irish non resident companies by company registration agents on the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands for many years.  The UK disallowed the registration of non-resident companies weeks ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the question of trade unions rather than trade unionists, modern Ireland owes its current position as an industrial nation to the development of the early trade union movement which dragged masses of downtrodden workers into the 20th century.  Trade unions gave a voice to workers who had not previously been heard. In this country's consciousness, trade unions are &ldquo;good guys.&rdquo; Under this Bill the Labour Party is <Col N="1364" /> trying to recast the role of trade unions.  With one ill-conceived Bill, it is endeavouring to demonise trade unions.  It wishes to turn them into another arm of the law, a vindictive, coercive, corrosive, &ldquo;big brother is watching you&rdquo; arm.  Ireland fought long and hard for democracy, both politically and industrially, and this Government will not turn the clock backwards at the electoral whim of the Labour Party.</P>

It wants to be seen as a party that can face down a major employer in north Dublin, bring Ryanair to its knees, win an election and to hell with all the structures of the State that have been established in the last half century to settle industrial disputes in a reasoned manner.</P>
      <P>Whether a worker wishes to join a trade union should be a matter of free choice.  Trade unions operate in an entirely voluntary way and nobody should be coerced to join one.</P>

      <P>Such a move would have a detrimental effect on relationships between employers, on productivity and on the image of Irish industries abroad.  Apart from the availability of an educated workforce, one of our main attractions for multinationals is the choice about trade union recognition.  Foreign multinationals have traditionally paid over the odds, their employees are happy and they see no reason for trade unions.  If trade union recognition were mandatory for multinationals, it would be another issue for them to consider before deciding to locate here.  They traditionally like greenfield sites and this includes a workforce untrammelled by work practices, associated with overaggressive trade unions, work to rules, go slows, walkouts and so on.  Like modern progressive native industries, multinationals prefer flexible dedicated workers who communicate their concerns to management and who work through their problems in an open and reasoned manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade unions are voluntary organisations.  It is not up to the State to guarantee membership of trade unions by forcing workers, through legislation, to join up.  Trade unions are necessary <Col N="1365" /> when desired by workers to provide them with a voice to communicate their needs and problems to management.  It would be much more beneficial, however, to concentrate on training and skills, on management communication, motivation and performance recognition.  There are circumstances where without the voice of a shop steward employment conditions would not have improved, but the power of the shop steward can sometimes be misdirected, even in a voluntary organisation.</P>
    <P>We cannot erode the freedom of workers to choose whether to join trade unions.  Democracy is about choice and freedom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>This works both ways.  It also applies to management's choice about how its organisation is managed and its staff is motivated. This includes freedom to choose to join a trade union movement or freedom to negotiate working conditions in whatever way suits the needs of the employer and the employees for the common good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill tonight.  The trade union movement has had an outstanding record in recent years.  It is unique compared with any other countries in Europe.  Through the Programme for National Recovery, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and Partnership 2000 it has been involved in social partnership at the highest level.  This has been achieved through a voluntary code on the basis that any agreement freely entered into between willing participants is a far better agreement than one forced on people through legal mechanisms.  That has contributed to the success of the trade union movement in recent years.</P>
      <P>ICTU's access to the Government and its direct say in framing important agreements for the country is unique.  It has a major input in budgets in respect of taxation rates and pay increases. Most trade unions in other European countries would give an arm and a leg to have that level of influence.</P>
      <P>We have had a fantastic record of industrial peace in the past decade or two.  Some ten or 20 years ago we were losing more than one million man-days per year through strikes.  The number of days currently lost through strikes has decreased dramatically because of the social partnership between Government, employers and trade unions and I would be very concerned about any approach to jeopardise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days I have tried to establish the number of trade union members.  From labour force surveys approximately 55 per cent of workers appear to be member of unions.  In reply <Col N="1366" /> to a letter I sent to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I was informed that approximately 90 per cent of public sector workers and 35 per cent to 40 per cent of private sector workers are unionised. There is a major disparity between those figures. Detailed research should be carried out to establish the facts about trade union membership.</P>
    <P>Peter Cassells stated on television last weekend that 91 of our top 100 companies recognise trade unions.  It is clear that there is a high level of trade union representation in major companies in the private sector, but the overwhelming majority of workers in small to medium size companies are not members of trade unions.  It is wrong to force something on the majority of workers in the private sector if it does not apply through a voluntary code.  I call for a full report to establish the facts so that debates like this can take place on an informed basis rather than on assumptions about figures.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the recent industrial relations difficulties have been about companies flexing their muscles when a private sector company competes with a public sector one. Employees in the public sector are generally sure of their positions because a down-turn in business does not lead to redundancies, but people in the private sector need additional flexibility when they face State monopolies.  It is important that there is flexibility in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Peter Cassells also stated that the main problem is with bad employers.  We need to tackle the question of low pay rates for unskilled workers and employers who deduct tax and PRSI but do not return it to the Revenue Commissioners. Those are the type of issues we should address if we are seriously concerned about the rights of workers and employees.  It is not merely a question of trade union recognition.  We should also recognise the needs of workers who have chosen not to join a trade union.</P>
    <P>While the Bill may have been well intentioned, it could have the opposite effect.  One has a constitutional right to join a trade union and the converse has been established in the courts.  One has also a right not to join a trade union.  Employers have a right to negotiate with unions if they so wish and employers have the same legal right not to do so if they so wish.  This legislation, if enacted, could disenfranchise some trade union members who have negotiating rights in a company even though they represent a minority of the employees in that company and the overwhelming majority of employees who are not members of trade unions may seek not to be represented by a trade union.  The Bill could be counterproductive from a trade union point of view.</P>
    <P>The system is not broken and we should not try to fix it.  The enactment of this Bill could do more harm than good.</P>

      <P>A law introduced to resolve one specific problem is not good law.  This Bill has been drafted mainly because of the dispute in Ryanair.  I acknowledge the difficulty in Ryanair and hope it can be resolved.  The enactment of this Bill, because of the use of the words &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; in numerous sections, would make it mandatory for employers to deal with trade unions and for employees to be members of a trade union.  I have no difficulty with employees being represented by trade unions where they so wish.  It is a fundamental right of any person who wishes to join a trade union that they be allowed do so.  If a majority of workers in a company wish to join a trade union, the employer should negotiate with that trade union.  If the Bill were enacted this would be mandatory and it would be a mistake to introduce it in that case.</P>
      <P>Without employers there would be no employees.  It is important to give employers as much latitude as possible.  Much of the legislation introduced in the past 15 years favours the employee.  What this country needs is more jobs. I come from a small town where 170 jobs were lost last week and the chances of those jobs being replaced are slim.  We need an entrepreneur to come in and provide extra jobs.  There is a similar requirement in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The Government should provide more incentives to people willing to take risks and provide employment.  It is important that there are good relationships between the employer and employee.  I speak from experience as an employer.  I am lucky that I had many excellent employees but there are problems which can be difficult to resolve.  It would be a mistake to accept that the way to proceed is by way of mandatory trade union membership.  It would make a mockery of the social partnerships built up.</P>
      <P>I recognise Deputy Broughan is attempting to have a problem resolved but by resolving one a large number could be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and emphasise the need to safeguard the basic right to trade union membership and the right to have that membership recognised by employers.  It says much about the current state of affairs in industry that it is felt necessary to bring forward legislation.</P>
      <P>The growing anti-trade union trend was seen in a recent survey of large companies investing in the State and employing 500 or more people. Only two of those 18 surveyed had recognised trade unions.  Lest it be thought that this anti-trade union culture is a foreign import, we need only remind ourselves of the disputes of recent years at Pat the Baker, Nolans Transport and the ongoing Ryanair dispute where employees are again fighting a battle which their great grandparents had to fight in this city in 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> One of the main reasons for this anti-trade union trend among employers is the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, introduced by the Taoiseach when Minister for Labour.  While this Act may not have been the all out assault on trade unionism which was made by Margaret Thatcher in Britain, it tipped the balance significantly against organised workers and in favour of intransigent employers.</P>
    <P>Some opponents of this quite modest Bill have cautioned against the use of legislation to coerce employers but the legal coercion is already there. The Industrial Relations Act interferes with the rights of trade unions to conduct their own affairs.  With compulsory secret balloting for industrial action it sets a standard higher than that for votes in this House.  The effect is to allow employers to drag trade unions through the courts and severely limit the right to take industrial action.  Employers may deploy all the resources at their disposal, including those of parent companies and other employers, to come to their aid in industrial disputes but trade unionists are legally barred from availing of the help of other workers.  Industrial action is and always has been a last resort in disputes but the anti-union trend means a new breed of employers, such as those at Ryanair, are by their refusal to recognise unions depriving employees of the first resort, the industrial relations machinery of the State.  To allow this to continue would be a recipe for spiralling industrial strife.</P>
    <P>A much neglected aspect of the issue of trade union recognition is the whole area of health and safety.  In the building industry casualisation is the norm and trade unions are rare.  Consequently there have been more accidents, more injuries and more deaths.  Unorganised and unprotected by the vigilance which good trade union organisation brings, workers in this industry are increasingly exposed to injury and death.  There has been an average of a death per month in the construction industry in the past 36 months.  This is the dark side of the construction boom of which we hear so much.  The culture of mé féinism, which has been built up in this economy and is actively fostered by many employers, seeks to undermine the strong tradition of democratic organisation among workers.  If the economy is to prosper, that tradition needs to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome if only to set in motion a debate which is vitally needed.  I am pleased to give it my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for sharing his time with me.  I support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Broughan on bringing it forward. It is before us immediately because of the refusal of Ryanair to recognise the industrial relations institutions of the State or the industrial relations practices of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Ryanair has not been slow to recognise the State when it comes to getting subsidies or assistance.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, told the House yesterday of <Col N="1369" /> some of the State assistance which has been given to Ryanair.  I draw the attention of the House to a more remarkable subsidy which Ryanair has been getting from the State since 1992.  Official Ryanair documents, copies of which I have examined, show that the company's headquarters is located on a key State-owned site at Dublin Airport which the company has occupied rent free since 1992, that the State has agreed to waive rent on the site until 2004 and that the company will enjoy a further 50 per cent rent reduction for the site for the following six years to 2010.  The prospectus published by the company at flotation in relation to its headquarters states:</P>
    <P>The building is included in fixed assets in the consolidated balance sheet at a net book value of £1,330,000.  The annual rental payable by the Group to the Minister is £192,000, but payment of the rent is suspended for the first 12 years of the agreement and Darley will receive a 50% rebate on the rent for six years thereafter.</P>
    <P>This subsidy amounts to an astonishing £3 million from the taxpayer.  It is unacceptable that a successful and extremely profitable company should be enjoying such a huge rent subsidy at the expense of the taxpayer.  Given the company's decision to thumb its nose at the industrial relations practices of the State, most people will react with anger and outrage at the news of this arrangement.  Given the attitude of Ryanair and its refusal to recognise the right of its baggage handlers to be represented by the union of their choice, the Minister for Public Enterprise must take immediate steps to terminate this extraordinary arrangement.  The European Commission should examine the arrangement which is, in effect, a direct State subsidy to the airline.</P>
    <P>Details of the rent arrangement were given in the prospectus circulated to potential investors at the time of flotation of the company.  The prospectus further reveals that for the first four years of the arrangement the beneficiary of the rent free arrangement was a trust established for the benefit of the children and grandchildren of Mr. Tony Ryan.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the House earlier this month I made the point that attempts by Ryanair to present itself as a heroic little company which had worked its way up the beanstalk by its own energy and with no State aid did not accord with the facts and that Ryanair had been given repeated doses of favouritism in the allocation of routes.  I was not aware, however, of the extent of the generosity the State has been showing to the company.</P>
    <P>This is a most successful company which reported profits of almost £100 million for the six months to the end of September.  The chief executive, Mr. Michael O'Leary, helped himself to a £17 million bonus over three years and the directors together took almost £24 million between 1995 and flotation.  Why should Mr. O'Leary and members of the Ryan family be in receipt of such <Col N="1370" /> a generous subsidy of £3 million from the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats which form part of the Government have never made any secret of their admiration for Ryanair.  Was it mere coincidence that this extraordinarily generous deal was negotiated when that party was previously in Government?  The Minister for Public Enterprise should make an immediate statement on the details of this arrangement, the background to it and the steps she intends to take to bring it to an end.</P>
    <P>The voluntary nature of industrial relations is being offered as the reason the Bill is being opposed.  A voluntary industrial relations code does not mean that workers or management are free to do what they like.  Workers have had to learn this by having their rights circumscribed in the industrial relations Acts.  An employer's right to hire and fire has been circumscribed in labour law.  There are many precedents, including the 1969 craftworkers strike and the 1990 legislation introduced in response to the changing industrial relations climate.  Where a prominent employer refuses to recognise the industrial relations institutions of the State, there is an obligation on the Government and the House to legislate to ensure employers volunteer to attend the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, something which Ryanair management has pointedly refused to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Broughan on introducing the Bill into which he has put much thought.  He has been working on the proposed measures for some time.  It cannot be said, therefore, that he sees the ongoing Ryanair dispute as an opportunity to advance some philosophically based policy measure or gain electoral advantage as Members on the opposite side of the House have suggested.  The Bill is a sincere attempt to add to the labour legislation in force.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill at this time serves to highlight the incredible situation at Ryanair where management has refused to talk to the chosen representatives of the majority of its baggage handlers.  Ryanair management is reputed to include some of the toughest negotiators in the country.  There have been reports that, following flotation, many Ryanair shareholders added millions of pounds to their wealth.  Ryanair management has to be tough, it is running a successful company in an industry where the margins are extremely tight and competition intense.  Much of the company's success, however, is due to its workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A successful company has to recognise the contribution of its workers.  There are times when an employer can be too tough.  Ryanair management needs to adopt a different approach when dealing with its workers.  It may be the case that it does not have the skills required to negotiate with professional negotiators in a manner in keeping with 21st century practices.  Some commentators have suggested that not alone is it unable to deal with <Col N="1371" /> its workers in a manner in keeping with 21st century practices it has not yet moved into the 20th century and is still languishing in 19th century thinking and methodologies with regard to industrial relations.  It should update its thinking and skills so that it can enter the modern age like almost all other successful companies.</P>
    <P>Most successful companies pride themselves on their good industrial relations.  Human resource management is cited as being vitally important.  If most companies placed human resource management at the forefront, there would be no need for this Bill.  It is incredible that a supposedly modern successful company lags so far behind when it comes to industrial relations that it has led to a strike which threatens the concept of social partnership on which much of our economic success is based or is it the case that Ryanair management is afraid to face professional negotiators?</P>
    <P>The issues workers want to discuss lend themselves to negotiation.  We owe much to the professional negotiators employed by the trade unions.  Their involvement in recent years has meant that emotion has been removed from the equation.  Issues have been dealt with in a practical and professional way.  Everyone has benefited &mdash; owners, management, workers, shareholders, consumers and the economy as a whole.  I am certain the issues at the core of this dispute could be dealt with to the satisfaction of all concerned, if modern day approaches were adopted by the company.  I understand the core issues include a pay claim, the introduction of a staff grading structure and effective health and safety procedures, and acceptance by Ryanair of the right of workers to be represented by professional negotiators.</P>
    <P>Since the onset of the dispute, Fine Gael has not been found wanting so far as the workers of Ryanair are concerned.  We have supported them from the start and will continue to do so.  We believe, however, that this Bill is not the way to go at this time.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill on 17 February Deputy Broughan said there is a long tradition of voluntarism in Irish industrial relations and a reluctance to resort to legislative sanctions.  He praised the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and the Employer Labour Conference and acknowledged that &ldquo;the vast majority of Labour Court recommendations are accepted by employers and trade unions&rdquo;.  He went further and cited the extension of social partnership since 1987 as being one of the chief reasons for the &ldquo;incredible economic prosperity Ireland has enjoyed in this decade&rdquo;.  By his words Deputy Broughan acknowledged the system as it exists at present works.  It works so well we are the envy of Europe.</P>
    <P>On 3 February last the Labour Court advised Ryanair to recognise the trade union and to negotiate the proposed agreement to regulate relations between the two sides.  IBEC has also advised Ryanair to attend the Labour Court and <Col N="1372" /> the Labour Court regrets the non-attendance of Ryanair.  Ryanair has two options.  One is to choose to give its workers generous terms and conditions, as many multinationals do in a nonunion environment, or it can grant union recognition and negotiate with its workers in the traditional way.  However, it cannot have the best of both worlds.  It was reported that ICTU is not calling for blanket mandatory union recognition, but is looking for the basic right of workers to have their union recognised if the majority of the staff want to join.  Trade unions now want professional representation not blanket recognition.</P>
    <P>However, as Deputy Owen pointed out, this legislation is untimely.  A high level working group is considering what should be done with a management that decides it will not listen to the views of its workers.  We should await the findings of that group.  Legislation already exists under sections 38 (1) and (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  It states that where the Minister is of the opinion that a trade dispute, actual or apprehended, affects the public interest he may refer the matter to the commission or the court which shall endeavour to resolve the dispute and where the Minister is of the opinion that a trade dispute is of special importance he may request the commission or the court or another person or body to conduct an inquiry into the dispute and to furnish a report to him on the findings.  I put it to the House that is the next step and it should be taken now if it has not already been taken.  I note the Minister of State is nodding and I take it that may now be happening.</P>

      <P>Partnership 2000 called for the setting up of a high level group made up of the social partners to examine this issue further.  That group has submitted an interim report and is due to meet again in the coming weeks to consider the position.  Its interim report recommended the continuance of voluntarism with regard to trade union recognition.  Fine Gael has always supported that concept and continues to believe it is the best way to maintain the valuable social partnership which has led to industrial peace for over ten years.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael recognises a further mechanism ought to be put in place to tackle the problem of employers who will not deal with their staff when they wish to be represented by a trade union.  We welcome the fact that this issue continues to be on the agenda of that high level group and we await the outcome of its deliberations.  The attitude of Ryanair management highlights the need for such a mechanism and Fine Gael calls again on the chief executive of Ryanair to attend the Labour Court to discuss the current dispute.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has powers under the Act which she should utilise to help resolve the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that voluntarism must ultimately remain the guiding principle of industrial <Col N="1373" /> relations if tens of thousands of existing and potential jobs are not to be put at risk.  Many thousands of jobs created by inward investment are non-unionised and good industrial relations are enjoyed between employers and employees. The IDA has been able to sell Ireland as a good location for international jobs specifically because our industrial relations code is based on voluntarism. The introduction of compulsion through this Bill would put the IDA's efforts to attract overseas investment at risk.</P>
    <P>At present Limerick has 50,000 jobs of which approximately 30,000 are non-unionised, but the type of legal compulsion proposed under the Bill would jeopardise those jobs.  In Dublin North multinational companies created approximately 6,500 jobs which are non-unionised.  One major international company alone has 1,700 jobs and that company and others would not have been attracted to Ireland if we had mandatory trade union recognition.  Those jobs would also be jeopardised by statutory compulsion of the type envisaged under this Bill.  The Labour Party legislation is not the way to proceed in the interests of the continuation of social partnership and inward industrial development.</P>

      <P>Problems have arisen and even though that Government's manifesto referred to trade union recognition it is having second thoughts on that issue.  It considers voluntarism, not trade union recognition, is the way to proceed. That debate also highlighted other problems which were also highlighted here prior to this.</P>
      <P>A good deal of work went into preparing the Bill.  It was a sincere effort to address an issue, but there are a few anomalies in it.  Reference was made to &ldquo;a substantial category&rdquo;.  We do not know what number constitutes a substantial category. That was discussed and is also part of the problem encountered in the debate in Britain.  My colleague Deputy Reynolds mentioned the issue of mandatory recognition.  The Bill states the employer recognises a particular trade union specified in the order.  Mandatory recognition is not the way to proceed.  We must build on partnership in order to succeed.</P>
      <P>I again call on Ryanair to attend the Labour Court.  Its management is on its own.  All those who have spoken here have raised the issue of Ryanair and asked it to attend the Labour Court. If it does not attend it will put a great deal at risk. Ryanair owes this country and State a good deal and it has been supported by this State through thick and thin.  It is now pay back time.  It should attend the Labour Court, negotiate and come into the 21st century.</P>

The debate his Bill stimulated in the House over the past two weeks served the useful purpose of allowing us to have a public airing of all the aspects of the controversial and complex subject of union recognition and there have been many thoughtful contributions over the past four days of debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen reflected on the change in the fortunes of the trade union movement in Ireland over the past century.  She summed up the history of the trade union movement well in her quotation from Professor Patrick Lynch's Thomas Davis lecture, in which he described the trade union movement in Ireland and the United Kingdom going through three stages, from oppression to tolerance to privilege.  Deputy Owen also observed wisely that words such as &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; used in the context of industrial relations are not consistent with good industrial relations and would damage our image abroad.  I could not agree more.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Broughan recognises his Bill represents a radical departure from the tradition of voluntarism in Irish industrial relations and the reluctance to resort to legislative sanctions.  He acknowledged the nation has been served well over the past 50 years by institutions such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission. He went on to note that the vast majority of Labour Court recommendations are accepted by both employers and trade unions.  That seems to be a strong argument in favour of retaining our voluntarist approach.  This Bill would radically damage that approach not just in relation to recognition disputes, but would almost certainly have repercussions for the whole of our voluntarist industrial relations system.  The system is a delicately balanced one and one cannot fundamentally alter one part of it without affecting the whole system.  Nowhere is the adage, &ldquo;if it aint broke, don't fix it&rdquo; more apt than in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, referred to his own experience as a trade unionist. He quite rightly pointed out that the trade union movement was strongly opposed to any move that would make the findings of the Labour Court binding.  As he said, &ldquo;trade unions have always jealously guarded their right to refer a matter to the Labour Court for its consideration and then to accept or reject its findings, depending on the mood of its members at that time&rdquo;.  This sums up well one of the difficulties this Bill potentially poses for the trade union movement.  If Labour Court recommendations were to be made binding in one area, there would almost inevitably be demands for employers that they should also be binding in other areas, something which would not be to the liking of unions.  In effect, the voluntarist <Col N="1375" /> approach would be seriously undermined by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Listening to the eloquent speech of the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, one would think this is a very innocuous measure his party is introducing.  Perception is often as important as reality in industrial relations.  While, as the Deputy said, the Bill does not include a mandatory recognition clause, it nevertheless indirectly puts legal pressure on an employer to recognise a union.  It would greatly alter the present position on union recognition.</P>
    <P>This debate has been much overshadowed by the present dispute in Ryanair.  I must be clear about this &mdash; the Government does not condone the attitude of the management in this dispute. As the Minister, Deputy Harney, pointed out last night, the essence of our voluntarist approach to industrial relations is that when industrial disputes cannot be resolved by local discussions and negotiations, they are referred to a third party, namely the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.  The attitude of Ryanair management in this dispute has been roundly and rightly condemned.  So far they have declined to take part in any discussions in the Labour Court which would serve, at the very least, to clarify the issues involved.  As the Minister said, if third party intervention would be helpful in this dispute, we would be prepared to look at the possibility of an independent inquiry under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  Before going down that road, however, we must be confident it will be helpful.</P>
    <P>Various speakers in this debate have remarked on the complex and difficult nature of the union recognition question.  It is a subject which has given rise to controversy not just in Ireland. However, as the International Labour Office commented in a study of collective bargaining, European countries have generally refrained from adopting measures which would impose on employers a statutory obligation to recognise unions and have preferred to resolve recognition issues by voluntary action, that is, through action by the parties themselves as distinct from the essentially legislative/administrative approach in North America.  We are not alone in the approach we have adopted in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the effect which the legalism of this Bill is likely to have on our voluntarist approach.  I now consider the effect it is likely to have on the industrial relations institutions, especially the Labour Court, and the potential for litigation to which it would give rise. One impact of this Bill, if enacted, would be to lead to litigation in industrial disputes.  The Labour Court has largely avoided this in the 50odd years of its existence.  By assigning a quasijudicial role to the court in one area of industrial relations, the Bill would undermine its effectiveness in assisting settlement of other types of dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> In addition, the involvement of the law courts in trade union recognition is likely to raise the general industrial relations temperature.  To introduce a fundamental level of compulsion within the system is to depart from its essential voluntarist underpinnings.  This could lead in future circumstances to other areas of compulsion in industrial relations, which would be anathema to both employers and the trade union movement. It would mean a return to the confrontation and adversarialisms of the past in industrial relations.  It would thus undo much of the work done by Government and the social partners in fostering a consensual and partnership approach both at national and workplace level, particularly over the past decade.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect on the benefits of social partnership. There is no doubt that the social partnership reflected in the four national programmes to date has been a key part of our economic success. Partnership 2000 follows the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> .  These programmes have provided the essential basis for the economic success we now experience.  That success has brought us within striking distance of the European average income.  It has brought us record increases in the numbers at work &mdash; there are 130,000 extra people at work over the three years of the PCW, which is more than one and a half times the total increase in employment over the previous 20 years.</P>

      <P>We are optimistic that it will.  The April 1997 Labour Force Survey showed a fall in unemployment of 61,000 since April 1993 and a growth in employment of 3.9 per cent, representing 51,400 additional jobs.  There has been a record number of announcements of new investment projects, increased numbers in higher education &mdash; the highest in the western world &mdash; and an air of confidence in business and society generally.  In short, social partnership has created the high standing of the Irish economy.  It has given us the economic performance so well recognised by international commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, for example, growth was four times the European average and it is estimated that for 1997 GNP growth was 7.7 per cent.  This is combined with inflation below the EU average. Ireland's year on year inflation rate in December 1997 was 1 per cent compared with an EU average of 1.8 per cent.  Our success has brought our public finances under control, with a general Government surplus of 0.9 per cent of GDP estimated for 1997.  Ireland's general Government debt to GDP ratio continues to decline &mdash; it is provisionally estimated at 67 per cent for the end of 1997 with 61 per cent forecast for the end of 1998.  Our economic success has produced a substantial real increase in net disposable income; for example, a real increase in income of 23 per cent <Col N="1377" /> for single people on average manufacturing earnings since 1987, compared to the reduction of 7 per cent in their incomes between 1980 and 1987. It has given us much lower interest rates and a strong balance of payments, which underpins our ability to achieve high growth on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>While it may not be the primary factor, one of the motivations in calls for trade union recognition is the fact that large multi-national corporations are setting up operations here with the assistance of the State's industrial development agencies, and employing policies not to recognise trade unions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, mentioned the other night that a number of unions had suggested that State agencies such as the IDA should pay grants, subsidies, etc., only to those green field companies who are prepared to recognise and deal with trade unions.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate to set preconditions regarding the way inward investment companies, or indeed indigenous investing companies, organise their employment relations.  I agree with the IDA, which argues that setting such preconditions would severely handicap agencies such as itself in their efforts to secure investment in the face of competition from development agencies elsewhere.  Competition in the international marketplace is aggressive and the IDA's performance on behalf of Ireland is the best in the world.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that mandatory trade union recognition &mdash; and changed policies that are perceived as mandatory, such as those proposed in the Bill &mdash; would impact adversely and substantially on inward investment in employment.  I am in no doubt as to the consequences which enactment of this Bill would have on this country's primary standing in such niche areas as electronics &mdash; it would be most damaging.</P>
    <P>Many new overseas companies choose not to recognise trade unions.  The way to tackle this problem is not to introduce policies, such as statutory recognition or grant contingency, which would discourage and possibly prevent such companies from setting up, rather for the trade union movement to make itself more attractive to these companies.  Not every trade union sees this as an impossibility.  For all these reasons, and many more, the Government cannot support the Bill. When Deputy Broughan takes an opportunity to positively consider the importance of inward investment and carefully balanced investment by the indigenous sector and the right of employees to make their own decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He must show solidarity with the trade union movement, investors in our country and the people at large so that our success can continue into the next millennium.</P>

      <P>When I introduced this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party last week, I called it a modest proposal, designed to resolve the growing problem of trade union recognition disputes.  The Bill was produced after lengthy consultation with the trade union movement, industry and the IDA. The first draft was produced in early October, as a contribution by the Labour Party to allay the fears expressed by constituents who, at that time, were denied their fundamental civil right to be represented by a trade union.</P>
      <P>I resent the implication in the statements of the Minister of State.  Deputy Kitt, and some other Fianna Fáil Members that the Bill was hastily cobbled together or ill timed.  It is the product of a great deal of thinking and research, not just by the Labour Party but throughout the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>I am the Labour Party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Last week, the Labour Party did not apologise for introducing a modest proposal and we do not apologise tonight.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to build on the long and proven experience of our industrial relations procedures, especially the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Under its provisions a trade union recognition dispute would be referred to the Labour Relations Commission which would investigate it and make a report.  Under sections 2 to 6 it would then go to the Labour Court, which can order and carry out an investigation.  It can also order a ballot, which would obviously be a ballot about trade union recognition.  That would be very clear to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, if he had studied the Bill.  Under section 10 the process would eventually result in an employment regulation order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out the development of our industrial relations procedure.  In essence, it strengthens the Labour Court and gives it a fair and balanced method of resolving trade union recognition <Col N="1379" /> disputes.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, now accepts the Bill does not order mandatory recognition of trade unions. That was not its aim or part of its remit and is nowhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding Deputy Stanton's generous comments tonight, for which I am grateful, the most striking feature of the six hour debate on the Bill has been the unholy, but natural, alliance between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, in fierce opposition to trade union and workers' rights.  This modest Bill has strikingly revealed the real agenda of the three conservative parties and the common vested interests which they represent.</P>
    <P>Day after day on the Order of Business and during debates the Labour Party and its allies &mdash; a small body of Deputies in this section of the House &mdash; must listen to a phoney war, and sometimes vicious, personality driven politics, between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.  In reality, these parties together represent the great centres of wealth and vested interest in society.  Their posturing and bluster on so many issues in this House is just so much hot air and verbiage.  They are in perfect agreement on the issues which matter to them.  As President Clinton's famous adviser, James Carville, said some years ago, the key issue is always &ldquo;the economy, stupid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies recently shed crocodile tears in Dublin Airport for the Ryanair workers who are denied their fundamental constitutional right to be members of a trade union.  Not one of those Deputies has the integrity or guts to support this simple measure in support of workers and trade union rights.  Their failure to so do will be long remembered by the people of north Dublin and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate there were references to the hasty and ill timed nature of the Bill, implying it was conceived solely as a response to the Ryanair dispute or the Dublin North by-election. In reality, the Bill had a long gestation, given the critical issues concerned for working people and their families.  However, the very reason for the Dublin North by-election reminds us of the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael partnership where it counts in local government, especially in the rezoning frenzy in County Dublin and Fingal.  It is Senator Seán Ryan's committed opposition over 15 years to the rezoning steamroller of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and their developer friends and his defence of the airport workers which gives him a strong chance of regaining his Labour Dáil seat.</P>
    <P>Government speakers, such as the Tánaiste, have tried to portray the Bill as some sort of threat to industrial relations and social partnership. However, it is the Government's failure to tackle the Ryanair dispute, and the underlying festering problem of the denial of trade union rights in many other companies, which endanger <Col N="1380" /> industrial relations proceedings and social partnership. Again and again deeply respected trade union leaders, such as Jimmy Somers, the president of SIPTU, and Mick O'Reilly, the general secretary of the ATGWU, have warned of the consequences for social partnership of allowing powerful employers, such as Michael O'Leary of Ryanair, to deny the constitutional right of workers to belong to a trade union.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, workers led by their trade union leaders have shown an incredible discipline and single mindedness in creating the basis for the prosperity now enjoyed by much of our society. Throughout that period, an average of at least 11 serious trade union recognition disputes annually have inspired a powerful demand among workers to have their constitutional rights protected. Deputy Moloney referred to his research on trade union membership.  As he acknowledged, trade union membership in the private sector is of the order of 30 or 35 per cent.  This demand of workers produced the high level group and submission of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Trade Union Recognition: The Right to Bargain, which influenced me heavily in drafting this Bill.</P>
    <P>Yet, on this, as on so many issues, this Government of U-turns has failed to take any decisive action and is now foolishly opposing this moderate and carefully researched Bill.  When will the Government stop wringing its hands on the Ryanair dispute, as we have seen so many Government Deputies do tonight, and take action to resolve the problem?</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Stagg, told us yesterday how Ryanair has received large assistance from the State and the European Union since 1989, in terms of discounted landing charges, job training and marketing and Forbairt grants amounting to almost £12 million.  In addition, priceless Irish landing slots abroad were allocated to Ryanair when it almost collapsed in the early 1990s. Deputy Gilmore told the House tonight that an additional £3 million of, effectively, State funding has gone to Ryanair through its arrangement for the rental of its headquarters at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>However, all the Tánaiste can say to Ryanair workers tonight is that she is prepared to look at the possibility of an independent inquiry under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  After a bitter dispute involving the serious harassment of workers over two or three months, why is the Tánaiste not calling this inquiry tonight?  Is she influenced by the generosity displayed to the Progressive Democrats by the owners of Ryanair, as revealed in the famous skip in South Frederick Street a few months ago?  I challenge her to accept the Bill and to intervene immediately under section 38(2) of the 1990 Act and order an independent inquiry into the Ryanair dispute.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and her misfortunate Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt &mdash; who is truly the Dan Quayle of Irish politics &mdash; have refused to accept the depth and seriousness of workers' and trade <Col N="1381" /> unionists' concerns on their basic constitutional right to belong to a trade union.  What is the use of Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution, guaranteeing the right to belong to associations and unions, if the Dáil refuses to vindicate that right in legislation as this trade union recognition Bill attempts to do?  It may well be that a future High Court or Supreme Court will interpret Article 40.6.1 as permitting the right to professional trade union representation as being implied in union membership, or a constitutional amendment may in future be necessary to copperfasten that right. This simple Bill avoids those complexities by strengthening the remit of the Labour Court.  It does not impose mandatory recognition of trade unions as implied in the distorted speeches prepared by their press officers and produced here by Fianna Fáil and PD Deputies.</P>
    <P>In section 6 the Bill simply gives the power to the Labour Court to make a recommendation in a trade union recognition dispute.  If this recommendation is ignored or not complied with, the Bill rightly gives a final sanction under section 10 to the Labour Court in terms of making an Employment Regulation Order on pay and conditions, on consultations with a union over matters already covered by legislation, and on disciplinary matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and her Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, have told us how 85 per cent or so of Labour Court recommendations have been accepted by both parties in recent years.  Why then should we expect recommendations on trade union recognition under this Bill to be any less successful, given the deep respect in which the Labour Court is generally held?  The protracted nature of some recognition disputes over recent years shows the urgent necessity for new procedures and a final sanction as the Bill proposes.  The solution offered here is not mandatory recognition but a simple procedure based on the long experience of Irish industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In their response to this Bill, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have hidden behind the voluntary tradition of our industrial relations.  In the past few decades, trade unionists and Labour Party Ministers in various Governments have been reluctant to legislate for this sensitive area of trade union rights.  However, as contributions to a recent meeting of the Irish section of the International Centre of Trade Union Rights showed, trade unionists and politicians of the labour movement have now accepted the urgent need for legislation.</P>
    <P>The contributions of the Minister and the Minister of State completely ignored the fact, to which I referred in my introductory speech, that more and more aspects of the employment contract are being decided by legislation and statutory instruments. Twenty-five years ago there were only a few key areas of workers' rights covered by law, including holidays, redundancy rights and basic conditions of employment.  Since then, especially when Labour have been in Government, a raft <Col N="1382" /> of very necessary legislation has been passed on matters affecting unfair dismissals, collective redundancies, transfer of undertakings, European Works Councils, working time, part-time working and young workers.</P>
    <P>This House will shortly be debating again a law on parental leave and EU legislation is planned on works councils and short-time contract employment.  Some of this legislation was passed in the teeth of opposition from certain groups of employers and did not have, despite the Minister's assertions to the contrary, the support of all the social partners.</P>
    <P>Why should the Oireachtas be fearful of legislation to protect the key constitutional right to be a member of a trade union?  The voluntary approach in this Government's argument is simply a fig leaf to avoid taking any action to support workers who are being intimidated and threatened with the loss of their jobs.  The outrageous claim by the Minister that US multinationals would refuse to come to Ireland if this Bill is passed is a total distortion of national policy on inward investment.  As my party leader, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, said last night, the attraction of high-tech US companies was in no way lessened when he was Minister for Enterprise and Employment by their knowledge that Irish workers might or might not elect to join a trade union.  My Labour colleagues and I cannot see how this Bill could pose any threat to the human resource policies of the US multinationals.  My visit to Silicon Valley clarified that.</P>
    <P>The Bill in no way allows the imposition of a union on employees who do not wish to be represented by a union.  Clearly the Labour Court will make a binding employment regulation order only if it finds that pay and conditions are out of line with industry norms.  Most multinationals with advanced human resource management structures would claim pay and benefit packages well above such norms, making union membership irrelevant.  In such cases many of these companies may prefer to deal with professional trade union representatives, however, and there are outstanding examples of very successful multinationals with a long history in Ireland which are fully unionised.  An example which springs to mind is of Data Products Hitachi in my own constituency which arrived in Ireland in the late 1960s.  It is still going strong and, of course, it is fully unionised and has made a deep impact in northside Coolock area.</P>
    <P>As many commentators have noted, the irony of the present Ryanair dispute is that the famous airline on which its company culture is modelled, Southwest Airlines of the US, is both brilliantly successful and recognises trade unions.  With regard to the hysteria generated by the Minister and the Minister of State concerning Ireland's competitors for inward US investment, let me remind them that the British TUC and the CBI are near to completing proposals to resolve trade union recognition disputes in the UK with the <Col N="1383" /> strong encouragement of Tony Blair's Government.</P>
    <P>Likewise many MEPs such as my colleague Bernie Malone, and the EU Commission itself, are proposing an EU directive on trade union recognition under the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties.  Once again, it looks as if we will have to look to Europe from this House for key legislation because of the inactivity of a Fianna Fáil dominated Government.</P>
    <P>The condemnation of this Bill by the Minister and her PD colleagues is to be expected, but the virulent response of Minister Kitt is a symptom of a deeper malaise.  His comments about the quasi judicial role of the Labour Court are especially laughable, given the fine history of that institution. Our Labour Bill is a simple mechanism to strengthen the court's power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and his brother, Deputy Noel Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, Deputy Brady and other Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken in this debate pride themselves on their consensus approach, learned they say through a personal trade union history. Tonight, however, they are betraying that history and voting with the &ldquo;Ryanair managements&rdquo; of <Col N="1384" /> this economy and against workers and their families</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that all workers and citizens must be treated fairly.  Fairness in an increasingly deregulated economy demands the right to be professionally represented for workers who desperately need it.  A point that was ignored by virtually all the speakers from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that we live in an increasingly deregulated economy.  We see throughout almost every area where formerly a very strong State sector existed that under EU competition policy we are moving into an era of deregulation.  Surely in that case individual workers, a group of workers, even a substantial group of workers in a company such as the baggage handlers of Ryanair, who wish to be represented, are at a very strong disadvantage dealing with a very powerful and rich management.  Surely a basic right they deserve is to be professionally represented by skilled trade union negotiators.  That is what we have sought to achieve with this Bill.  In around 70 per cent of the private sector, workers do not have the power to exercise this constitutional right to belong to and be represented by a trade union.  The Labour Party's Trade Union Recognition Bill tries to remedy this need.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I commend it to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House.  I want to bring to his attention a proposal which I think he will find exciting and innovative.  I ask him to spend a little time examining this proposal.  I know his time is limited, but I am sure that when he appraises the suggestions I am about to make, he will agree that a case exists for seeking funds from Europe or elsewhere to make these proposals a reality.  I speak of course of reopening the rail link to Carrigtwohill and Midleton in east County Cork.</P>
      <P>The commuter service to Midleton and Youghal closed in 1963 and the rail line closed completely in 1981.  Between 1963 and 1981 the line was used to transport sugar beet.  I am told the line opened specially in 1988 because Midleton won the all-Ireland hurling final.  Therefore, the rail line was functioning only ten years ago.</P>
      <P>In Midleton and its environs there has been an increase in population from approximately 15,000 in 1966 to 21,000 in 1991.  In 1995 the primary school population in the greater Midleton area, including Youghal, was well over 5,000.  The last two years has seen an unprecedented growth in the number of new houses in east County Cork. Midleton, in particular, has become a dormitory town for Cork city.</P>
      <P>Many people live in Midleton and work in Cork.  Many of these people neither need nor want to bring their cars into the city.  Many have approached me and asked me to bring the situation to the Minister's attention.  The Minister will agree, I am sure, that any action we can take to decrease the number of cars travelling to Cork city each day must be welcome.  I need not tell the Minister that the pressure on parking facilities and the increase in pollution are issues which must be tackled at national level, although this is a major issue in Cork city due to the increased number of cars going into the city.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Iarnród Éireann already gets a large subvention from the State.  However, the manager in Cork, Mr. Seán Cullinane, tells me there is no money available to Iarnród Éireann to tackle a project such as the one proposed.  This is why I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister and the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The amount of money involved would be tiny compared to the amount of money which we are rightly putting into our road network.  However, we are not looking for something on the scale of Luas for east County Cork.  What we are looking for is very small in comparison, but the benefits to the region as a whole would be enormous.</P>
      <P>The proposal to reopen the line is contained in the Cork County Council's county development plan.  Both Midleton Urban District Councils and the chamber of commerce are anxious that progress be made on it.  I understand that Cork Chamber of Commerce is also very much in favour of reopening the Cork-Midleton line.</P>
      <P>As well as a commuter service, the rail link would benefit tourism and the entertainment industry both in Cork city and in east County Cork.  Hundreds of people who travel to Cork city each day to shop, visit relatives and people in hospital could use the service as well as the hundreds who work or go to schools and colleges in the city.  The benefits would work in the other direction too because east Cork is famous for its beaches and heritage attractions.  From the Jameson Heritage Centre in Midleton to the round tower in Cloyne and the glorious beaches of Garryvoe and Youghal, there is potential for fashion, industry and tourism.  East County Cork has it all except the rail link, and we want the rail link.</P>
      <P>Anybody travelling to Cork from Midleton each day by car faces a huge problem with traffic congestion on the approach to Cork city.  Delays of over an hour have been reported to me.  The reopening of the rail link would be a popular and profitable decision.  Iarnród Éireann needs the Minister's help.  I ask him to try to find the relatively small amount of money that would make this a reality.</P>

      <P>The upgraded Arrow link to Cobh has meant an increase of 25 per cent in passenger numbers.  I am certain that the reopening of the link to Midleton, and eventually Youghal, would be successful also and serve to <Col N="1387" /> make the area more attractive for new industry and business.  People could travel from east Cork to all parts of the country by using the rail network. Access to national sporting fixtures would also be possible by rail.  I ask the Minister to use his imagination and sense of innovation to grant this proposal special favour.</P>

      <P>This proposal is very serious to the future economic development of east Cork region.  Throughout the country we have been extremely remiss in the way we have allowed the railway lines to be seriously run down over the past 20 to 30 years.  There has been significant investment in our mainline system, but if lines such as the Cork-Midleton line, which have been allowed to run down and finally close, were reopened it could do much to regenerate rural areas.  Investment in rail is good value for money from an economic and social point of view, and it should receive the most serious consideration.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Stanton pointed out, a rail link to east County Cork would benefit the region.  It would take a huge number of cars off the road on a daily basis.  It would be good from a tourism point of view and it could only do good for the region in general.</P>
      <P>I know the funds available to Iarnród Éireann are such that it cannot make progress on such a project without Government investment.  I am interested in hearing the Minister because I am sure other regions would be interested in attempting similar projects to that which we are seeking for Midleton and east Cork.  I fully support the case made by Deputy Stanton and I look forward to a favourable reply from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Stanton and Bradford for raising this issue which is so important to their constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is committed to the development of an improved public transport system throughout the country.  The railways have a valuable contribution to make and have shown a steady growth in passenger numbers in recent years. In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government identified investment in the mainline <Col N="1388" /> and suburban rail network as one of its key priorities in the transport area.  The Minister's target is to deliver on the Government's objectives in a structured and orderly way.  She wants to ensure safe and efficient railway services are provided in a cost effective and competitive manner. She has therefore asked that the investment needs be fully examined and is awaiting the relevant reports from CIE.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will appreciate the background to these investment needs studies.  In 1993, the investment needs for the entire railway network were estimated at approximately £800 million over a 30 year period.  The Operational Programme for Transport, which covers the period 1994-99, recognised that the railway required an integrated investment and development programme. This is needed to maintain and improve its competitiveness, to sustain existing demand and to create the potential for shift in demand and modal split towards the railway in the future.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Transport, total investment in the mainline rail network will amount to more than £275 million.  This programme is being focused on track renewal, modern signalling systems and rolling stock.  All major lines on the inter-urban mainline rail network are included.  The work being undertaken will result in increased safety, lower operating costs and shorter journey times.</P>
    <P>Improvements in suburban rail have also been provided for.  Iarnród Éireann is committed to improving the rail service in the greater Cork area.  A number of improvements have already been made.  For example, two new diesel rail cars were introduced on the Cork-Cobh service in 1996 as part of the upgrading of services recommended in LUTS, the land use and transportation study.  The Minister was pleased to note that passengers carried on the line increased by 20 per cent following the introduction of the railcars.  She has no doubt that this augurs well for the future of public transport in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a particular interest in this issue and has asked that the situation be reviewed in detail.  In doing so she is aware that the LUTS discussed the possible extension of the commuter service to Midleton.  The line was closed in the 1960s and the trackwork is no longer serviceable. Her understanding is that it would cost something of the order of £8 million to provide track, signalling and rolling stock.</P>
    <P>There are other public transport issues to be considered in Cork and these include the development of Kent Station and the development of improved passenger and car-bus-rail interchange facilities.  It is essential that priorities are identified quickly and that any development programme maximises scarce resources.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out before in this House, funding for infrastructure development comes from the EU under both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and from CIE resources.  The Minister is now looking to future investment programmes using these sources of <Col N="1389" /> funding and has sought a comprehensive study of mainline rail investment needs covering track, signalling, rolling stock and stations.  This study will specifically identify investment needs for the railway over the medium term and will also review rolling stock policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied, however, that the needs of the Cork area should be examined in particular detail and in an integrated way, as has been done in Dublin.  She has asked that, in relation to Cork, the different strands of work being done on transport investment needs be brought together in a single document.  This will cover the various public transport modes in Cork including bus and rail.</P>
    <P>This work is nearing completion and the Minister expects to have the report shortly.  This will provide the basis for developing an investment programme for the medium term and will contribute to the successful development of public transport infrastructure in the Cork area.</P>

      <P>I seek information from the Minister of State in relation to Ireland providing funds to the IMF.  I ask this question in the context of either the Department of Finance or the Central Bank, and I would like some clarification.  I do not intend to go on at length about the situation in Indonesia.  There is currently financial chaos in the country.  The IMF is bailing out a number of countries including Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia in particular, and my understanding is that the largest tranche of money &mdash; $46 billion &mdash; will go to Indonesia.  That money will come from contributions from Ireland, the European Union and other countries including the United States of America.  The reality is that the largest contribution will come from the European Union, collectively, as happens now in most of these projects.</P>
      <P>Has a request has been received by the Department of Finance or by the Central Bank?  What are the procedures in the Department to assess the merits or otherwise of this request in relation to human rights in Indonesia and in East Timor? I am particularly concerned about East Timor because despite some prospects of a breakthrough last year, the report published recently by the East Timor Human Rights Centre, Breaking the Cycle of Human Rights Violations in East Timor, which I am sure most Deputies received in recent days, concludes that the breakthrough it was expecting has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity now in relation to any contributions that may be sought from us.  I would like to believe this matter will be discussed at the ECOFIN meeting where they will not trouble themselves unduly with human rights issues, but it may also be discussed by the General Affairs <Col N="1390" /> Council.  Will the Minister of State ensure that our Minister for Foreign Affairs raises this matter in the General Affairs Council because the General Affairs Foreign Ministers are perhaps more engaged in human rights issues than the Finance Ministers?</P>
    <P>I would like an undertaking from the Minister of State, if the request has not been received to date, that when it is received there is some procedure whereby the request is brought into this House.  It is not good enough if the Department of Finance or the Central Bank participate in the contribution of $46 billion to aid the Suharto regime.  The Minister may be aware there is growing concern in the international financial community that this money may be used for the wrong purposes.  The currency is in crisis and the state is being run primarily by President Suharto, his family and their friends.  There is concern that this money will be used to bail out the people who matter in Indonesia which would be totally at odds with what it is intended for, namely, to save an economy.</P>
    <P>I would like some clarification from the Minister of State as to whether the request has been received and, if it is received, what the procedures are for considering whether we will participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a note of some of the points Deputy Spring made to which I do not have specific answers, but we will respond to them.  I know the Deputy has a deep knowledge of many of the issues involved but I would like to clarify some points.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify Ireland's involvement in measures being taken to address the current crisis in Indonesia.  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland supports international, and particularly EU, efforts to improve human rights in the world at large and more particularly, in the context of this motion, in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has specifically raised the question of the contribution of any moneys to the IMF which he sees as grant aiding the Suharto regime.  I would like to clarify the position in relation to the IMF.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is a member of the IMF and its share in the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of this institution is about 0.4 per cent of the total. Ireland has not made any contributions to the IMF specifically earmarked for Indonesia. However, in response to the currency crisis the IMF supports a programme of economic reform in Indonesia, as well as in other Asian countries. The IMF contribution to this programme is primarily by way of a stand-by loan which is not a grant and which will have to be repaid.  The loan, to the extent it is taken up, will involve the general resources of the fund and consequently a share of the Irish quota, in common with the quotas of all the other members of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other loan contributions are being made by the World Bank, of which Ireland is also a member, <Col N="1391" /> and the Asian Development Bank of which we are not a member.  In addition, a number of countries have indicated that they would be prepared to offer bilateral assistance provided the IMF programme is seen to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The IMF is not equipped to be an arbiter of human rights implementation.  In this matter it would defer to the United Nations where, for example, a policy of sanctions was in place. Nevertheless the programme which Indonesia has agreed with the IMF, while operating primarily from a macro-economic stance, contains a number of elements which are, in the broadest sense, in the interests of the people of Indonesia.  These include conditions on the breaking up of monopolies, the reorganisation of the banking and corporate sectors, improved governance in these sectors and the insistence that such budget cuts as are required should not be at the expense of the poor.  While Indonesia has made significant progress in alleviating poverty over the last 30 years, unfortunately large numbers of people still remain in poverty and it is imperative the structural adjustment programme does not result in a worsening of their economic and social conditions.</P>
    <P>The Irish position, through the Canadian chair, in the fund has been strongly supportive of the conditions attaching to the programme.  It is important, in the context of the involvement of the fund in both the Indonesian and the wider Asian crises, to consider the implications of the fund simply standing aside.  This would have led to a situation which would have had worse consequences for the people of the countries concerned. I remind the Deputy that the IMF is currently reviewing compliance with the programme and will be quite prepared to act should its conditions be disregarded.  Having said that, the fund is open to looking at conditions which, in the light of experience, might be seen as too stringent.</P>
    <P>I summarise my response to the Deputy's motion as follows.  Ireland is not contributing additional moneys to the IMF for Indonesia over and above what is already in the general resources of the fund.  This involves loans, not grants.  It is in the context of the currency crisis, not only in Indonesia but in a wider Asian perspective. The economic conditions included in the IMF programme should benefit the people of these countries and Ireland will continue to press for respect for human rights in all the appropriate fora available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has adopted a policy of not stationing gardaí in small villages or towns.  When a long-serving garda retires in one of these areas he or she is seldom, if ever, replaced.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received many similar representations from areas seeking a full time Garda presence <Col N="1392" />&mdash; there are many such areas in Wicklow and north Carlow &mdash; but the request almost always falls on deaf ears.  The reasons outlined for the policy are uniform, namely: the station is manned from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Saturday; it is policed as part of the community policing initiative in operation in the district; the subdistrict is patrolled by the district patrol car; there is a direct communications link outside opening hours; there is no regulation to compel gardaí to reside in a particular town or village and the Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the level of coverage afforded to the area is adequate.</P>
      <P>The Minister can hide behind those explanations because he can produce statistics to show the level of crime has dropped &mdash; I am sure the Minister's speech will reflect that.  I do not know who is driving this policy.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be aware that in many rural areas people no longer take the trouble to report crime.  They view it as a useless exercise, and a small group of petty criminals or vandals are permitted to hold communities up to ransom.</P>
      <P>One of the strongest assets of the Garda has been the ability to gather intelligence, and many potential wrongdoers have been identified at an early stage and corrected in their ways.  Unfortunately, because of the lack of a Garda presence, those people now remain unimpeded as they progress on the crime ladder.  Several communities in Wicklow &mdash; for example, Dunlavin and Shillelagh &mdash; are crying out for a change in policy, but their cries remain unheard.  Current policy must change and, in time, it will because some Minister will realise that, despite all the statistics the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may produce, there is frustration in many communities with the current position, which must be redressed.  That may take one year or five years, but it will be done.</P>
      <P>Official Garda accommodation in many towns and villages lies idle and is falling into a state of disrepair.  The Minister should consider a refurbishment programme and provide a special outpost allowance for gardaí to reside in those areas. I ask the Minister to consider present policy which contributes greatly to the erosion of the quality of rural life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is grateful to the Deputy for the opportunity to restate the Government's position on the rural community policing scheme.  The scheme has been operating in 14 Garda districts since 1991.  The Garda Commissioner is currently evaluating the operation of the scheme and is reviewing previous proposals for its extension.  As part of this review, he has recently introduced trial modifications to the scheme under a pilot test arrangement in two of the 14 Garda districts in which the scheme currently operates.  The Garda districts selected by the Commissioner for this purpose are Nenagh and Newcastlewest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> The trial changes, which commenced on 23 February, are intended to enhance the operational effectiveness of the scheme.  They involve the creation of community policing teams to provide for improvements in continuity of service to the community and more flexibility in relation to opening hours of stations involving an evaluation of local policing needs and consultation with local communities.  These changes will facilitate further study of the rural community policing initiative in the context of the general review of the entire scheme.  The Minister would like to emphasise, however, that no decisions concerning extension of the scheme have been taken and no such decisions can be taken until proposals are received from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years concerning the objectives of the rural community policing scheme.  Regrettably, the scheme is synonymous in the minds of some with the closure of Garda stations.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is aimed at providing a better service to the community by allowing gardaí to spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly while at the same time providing for station opening hours which suit local community needs.  The Minister wishes to make it clear that no Garda station will close during his tenure of office.  He would like to assure the Deputy that the Government has not been associated with and has no agenda in relation to the closure of Garda stations or reduction of policing services to the public.  The position is quite the contrary.  The programme for Government provides for additional Garda recruitment with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,000.  This additional recruitment commenced last month.  The fact that a considerable number of gardaí will be available following completion of the recruitment programme means we will be able to ensure there are more gardaí in rural communities.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important issue in the Dáil. Like myself, many people will have been shocked and scandalised at the six-column headline in <i>The Examiner</i> on Tuesday last about a 14 year old for whom there is no detention space.  The judge hearing the case said that it is scandalous that such accommodation is not available.  This young person was charged not for mitching from school or robbing apples, but for a serious crime of attempted robbery, allied with other charges of provoking a breach of the peace.  The inspector of the Garda representing the State said that he would have applied to have the young person remanded in custody, but there is no place for him.  The Southern Health Board agreed this boy appears to be out of control but it has no place available for him.  The probation service is also concerned that no space is available.  The judge <Col N="1394" /> had no option but to release the boy on bail.  In an earlier remand at the weekend the judge said that if any member of the public &ldquo;falls foul of this boy that member of the public would have good cause for action against the State&rdquo;.  This country cannot rest easy while such circumstances prevail. We must consider the boy's situation and that of the public because the State owes a duty to both.</P>
      <P>The next headline in the newspaper from which I quoted earlier reads &ldquo;Four month jail sentence for teenager&rdquo;.  In this case there was no place to put a 15 year old boy other than in prison.  That is appalling.  However, let me concentrate on the case before us.  The State has a clear duty to the boy in question and it also has a duty to protect the public.  What action is it taking in this regard? As far as I am concerned, it is not taking action and failing on both fronts.  What should the State do?</P>
      <P>The legislation relevant to this area dates back to 1908.  My colleague, Deputy Currie, introduced a Bill last year to update that legislation.  There was no great co-operation from the then Opposition, the Bill foundered on Second Stage and lay in cold storage until after the general election. Nothing has happened in the interim but I understand the Bill has recently been revived by the Government and referred to committee.  That modern legislative framework must be put in place.</P>
      <P>With regard to resources, I had hoped the Minister would come before the House to reply to this issue.  Having said that, however, I am not sure to which Minister I should be referring.  Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have responsibility for this matter or is it the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children?  I understand that under the new Bill the Minister for Health and Children will have responsibility for children.  Perhaps it is not a bad thing that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, is present because I understand he has responsibility for certain resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The last aspect of this matter to which I will refer is the Constitution.  There is a constitutional duty on the State to deal with situations of this nature.  Article 42 provides that &ldquo;The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.&rdquo; Article 42 further provides that &ldquo;In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents&rdquo;. <Col N="1395" /> Has the State lived up to its constitutional obligation in this case?  In my opinion, it has failed the boy in question and the general public.  I demand that the State change tack and do what is necessary to deal with the case of this boy and similar cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was amused because he was one of the Ministers to whom the Deputy did not refer.</P>
      <P>I understand that Finglas Children's Centre was approached regarding a remand and assessment place for the boy in question three weeks ago.  At that time, a place in St. Michael's remand and assessment unit of the Finglas centre was reserved for the boy.  I understand that the place in question was held available for the boy for a period of two weeks.  However, as the boy was not brought to the centre during that time, the place was allocated to another boy who had been referred to the centre by the courts.  A subsequent request for a remand and assessment place for the boy in question was made to Finglas Children's Centre and the centre indicated that the earliest date on which he could be accommodated for assessment was 21 April 1998.</P>
      <P>Assessments are carried out at this centre at the request of the courts and normally take place over a three week period.  The assessment process undertaken is comprehensive so that a detailed report on the special needs of each child being assessed can be presented to the courts to assist in deciding on how the child should be dealt with by the courts.  It is normal practice, therefore, for assessments to be booked in advance to ensure that the necessary background information and details are available to the professionals to enable them undertake the assessment process in a planned and structured way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Oberstown Boys' Centre was originally approached in relation to a remand place for the boy in question on the afternoon of Friday, 20 February 1998.  At that time, the court was informed that the only remaining remand place was being held for another boy following a request earlier in the day from the court in Cork. However, I further understand that the remand place which had earlier been reserved by the court was not subsequently taken up and that the centre was advised in the late afternoon of Monday, 23 February 1998 that the boy for whom the place had been reserved had been placed elsewhere. Arising from this development, a remand <Col N="1396" /> place became available in Oberstown Boys' Centre on the afternoon of Monday, 23 February 1998.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has asked the management of Oberstown Boys' Centre to advise the authorities of the availability of this place.  I understand the boy is due in court again on Monday next and the bed in Oberstown will be available if the court decides to remand him there.  It will still be possible to have the boy assessed in St. Michael's remand and assessment unit on 21 April.</P>
    <P>The current provision for young offenders under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science comprises five special schools certified under the Children Act, 1908.  They provide a total of 210 places for boys and 15 places for girls.</P>
    <P>On the general question of accommodation provision, it is extremely difficult to forecast with any degree of precision the number of custodial places required to accommodate juvenile offenders.  Demand for such accommodation can vary from day to day, depending on decisions taken by the courts.  In the case of reformatory school places there is growing pressure on the 60 places currently available for young male offenders in the 14 to 16 age group.  There is also pressure on the 16 places available for young female offenders.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the legislative measures set out in the new juvenile justice Children Bill which is to go to Committee Stage shortly will provide the framework for future service delivery. However, these measures will take some time to be brought into effect and will have significant resource implications.</P>
    <P>In the interim, a range of more immediate measures aimed at addressing the current placement difficulties which have attracted significant recent attention in the courts and in the media are being undertaken.  These proposals provide for the development of additional residential places for children who are out of control and for those who are convicted of offences.  The health authorities will provide up to 48 secure places for out of control children who have not been convicted of offences.  Design of purpose built units and adaptation of existing health board facilities is currently well advanced.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently engaged with consultants in the process of planning for the development of additional provision for young offenders.  Full consideration is being given in this process to the likely demands to be placed on the young offender schools by the advent of the new Children Bill. The measures outlined will make a significant contribution to ensuring that adequate accommodation will be available in the future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 February 1998.</P>

      <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to <Col N="1398" /> become members.  Benefits under this scheme are additional to the survivor's contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts for which soldiers are insured by virtue of their PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>In 1985 a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted when all soldiers, as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers, who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme. Unfortunately, not all availed of this option.  It is estimated that currently there are about 200 Army widows who are not eligible for pensions under the contributory scheme because their late husbands were not members of the scheme.</P>
      <P>At this stage, all soldiers who were serving when the original scheme was introduced in 1978 have had two opportunities to join the scheme. The question of again reopening membership options has been considered on a number of occasions over the past few years, but I regret it has not been found possible to make any concession. In this regard, there would be implications for many other public sector areas if membership options were reopened in respect of the Defence Forces's scheme.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing the deduction of rations are provided for in Defence Force Regulations. Under normal arrangements a marriage certificate is required from a reservist to confirm marital status.  In addition, any changes in the reservist's address must be notified to the unit concerned.</P>
      <P>However, following consultation with representatives of the personnel of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association &mdash; RDFRA &mdash; was established in July 1992.  The association represents its members in discussions with the Department of Defence on matters concerning their remuneration and certain other conditions of service.  Rates of allowances, including deductions for rations, come within the scope of representation.  Accordingly, this matter comes within the remit of RDFRA and can be dealt with under the representative arrangements which have been agreed with the association and it is open to the association to present a claim at any time.  No claim has been received from the association in regard to the question of ration deductions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 80, 82, 153, and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-1998 has certainly not been abandoned. Indeed, I am very satisfied with the progress to date in implementing this plan.  Significant developments are taking place in all the main areas addressed by the plan.  The key focus in the plan is on creating the right organisation to deliver value for money military services which meet the needs of Government and the public.</P>
      <P>The implementation plan which is essentially strategic in nature sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place during the first, three year, phase of a reform process that will take ten years to accomplish.  The particular focus during the initial phase is on the reform of the Permanent Defence Force structure and organisation. Reforms are being implemented in a planned and sensitive manner with the full backing of the military authorities and ongoing consultation with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation. Since assuming office I have listened to a range of views within the Defence Forces and I am committed to ensuring that the process of consultation and communication continues.  The reform programme is tackling in a positive way the many problems confronting our Defence Forces, for example the high age profile, inadequate collective training, the excessive numbers working in civilian type jobs and the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet recently approved the draft heads of a Bill which will amend the Defence Act, 1954, to give effect to the reorganised top level military structure set out in the implementation plan.  The amendment will reorganise Defence Forces Headquarters, abolish the positions of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General and replace them by two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff.  Work is also under way to amend Defence Forces regulations where necessary to give legal effect to the new military organisation.</P>
      <P>With regard to personnel issues, moves have been taken to address the age profile problem. A voluntary early retirement scheme launched in 1996 has been availed of by more than 1,200 Defence Force personnel over the last two years. In tandem with this scheme, a recruiting drive has taken place.  In 1997, the recruitment of 46 cadets, 17 apprentices and 600 recruits was authorised and advertisements for 500 recruits for general service will appear in the media very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> The questions of equipment and infrastructure are important elements of the development of the Defence Forces.  The Government's commitment to continue a programme of major investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces has been proven.  In the three years 1995-97 no less than £29 million was provided in infrastructural investment in military barracks generally. When the voluntary early retirement scheme is completed at the end of 1998, a substantial amount of savings from the reduced payroll will be allocated for equipment and infrastructural purposes.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Defence Forces is developmental in nature.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces become a more effective and efficient organisation geared to deliver the required military and other defence services in a value for money way. I am confident that the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces envisaged in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan will be accomplished by 31 December 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources recently announced his intention to develop and identify the Irish marine emergency service as a national coastguard service and that he intends to bring forward specific proposals in this regard later in the year.  The proposed new coastguard service will give greater public recognition to all personnel involved in marine emergency response.  As regards a possible role for the Naval Service in the new coastguard service, I will give full consideration to any proposals in this regard which may be put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 30, 35, 55, 111, 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish marine emergency service &mdash; IMES &mdash; of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in this country.  The arrangements necessary for the provision of the service are, therefore, a matter for that Department.</P>
      <P>At present, search and rescue coverage on the east coast is provided by the Air Corps from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and on the north west coast from Finner, County Donegal, in addition to the civilian operated search and rescue service being provided at Shannon.  As part of an ongoing programme of development of search and rescue services in this country, a civilian operated medium-load carrying search and rescue helicopter is to be provided on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998.  The service will operate on a temporary basis from Dublin Airport, but will be located at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase have been resolved.  The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years has meant the Air Corps is currently not in a position to provide pilots for this service.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the commencement of this service on the east coast, the search and rescue service currently provided by the Air Corps at Baldonnel will be relocated to the south east coast. This service, which will initially be restricted to daylight hours, utilising an Alouette helicopter, will be based in Waterford.  It is intended to upgrade this service to a 24 hour one using a Dauphin helicopter at the earliest possible date. The service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots introduced by my Department last year, with the ongoing training of pilots and the yearly recruitment of Air Corps cadets, is intended to ensure a continuing supply of well trained pilots for the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 81, 91, 97 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met the Incorporated Law Society on 9 December 1997 and I met them on 20 January 1998.  A working group will continue the work of these meetings in seeking to explore ways of reducing legal costs in these cases.  A mutually convenient date for the meeting of the group is at present being arranged.  A decision of the Government on 16 December 1997, directed that legislation be prepared to prohibit advertising by solicitors, at least in the area of personal injuries.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is at present drafting this legislation in consultation with the Law Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 39, 49, 157, 158, 169 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>At present, the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The current strength of the Naval Service at 31 December 1997 is 1,025 &mdash; including cadets.  Arising from recent recruitment campaigns 20 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in 1996 and a further 80 in 1997.  Thirteen Naval Service cadets and four apprentices are undergoing training at present.  A further recruitment campaign to the Defence Forces will be advertised shortly and it is hoped to recruit a total of 500 in this campaign, some of whom will be assigned to the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>A competition will be advertised shortly to recruit ten watchkeeping officers to the executive branch of the Naval Service.  All applicants who meet the general qualifications and standards laid down by the Department of Defence are eligible to compete and all applications will be treated on merit.  The advertising of vacancies in publications outside the State is not unusual given the nature of the posts being filled and the qualifications required.  It is likely that a number of professionally qualified candidates who would be interested in these positions may be resident and employed outside Ireland and it is desirable to make such potential candidates aware of the vacancies in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed breakdown of the strength of the Naval Service on 31 December, 1997, the latest date for which detailed figures have been compiled, is shown in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The number of Naval Service officers who retired each month over the past 12 months is also shown in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  All these officers who retired in the past 12 months retired before the retirement <Col N="1408" /> age.  The question of resources in terms of the personnel and equipment required by the Naval Service to enable it to fulfil its role is kept under continual review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 40, 47, 50, 51, 72, 89, 94, 103, 114 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Details of personal injury claims from members of the Defence Forces and from civilians involved in road traffic accidents with Army vehicles, which were finalised during each of the years 1992 to date are given in the tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to the hearings loss cases, on 17 February this year settlements had been reached in a total of 1,422 cases and court awards following hearing had been made in 87 cases.  A further 59 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Compensation of £36.161 million and plaintiff costs of £6.136 million has been paid in respect of the 1,568 cases finalised. There are a further 10,125 cases to hand.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met the Law Society on 9 December 1997 and I also met them on 20 January 1998.  A working group will continue the work of these meetings in seeking to explore ways of reducing legal costs in these cases.  A mutually convenient date for the meeting of the group is at present being arranged.  The interdepartmental working group, which is chaired by my Department, consists of representatives of the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the Office of the Attorney General.  It is tasked specifically with examining a number of legislative options which might be adopted to deal with this problem.  It has met on three occasions since its formal establishment in January 1998.  Prior to that the departmental representatives were in regular contact.  The working group is making satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on assessment of handicap resulting from hearing loss &mdash; the Green Book &mdash; is expected shortly.  It is intended to adduce this report in evidence in further cases before the courts and it will be a matter then for the Judiciary to decide its probative value.  As this is an outcome which I cannot predict, I am not in a position to comment further on any effect the report may have on expenditure other than to say that I hope it will provide a basis for uniformity and fairness of compensation.  Pending receipt of the report of the expert group all cases have been adjourned to the beginning of next term which I believe is 21 April 1998.  The selection of the expert group was a matter entirely for the Department of Health and professional expertise and expertise were the only criteria used in inviting members to participate.  Furthermore the group was told at the outset that it was free to consult with, and take evidence from, whomsoever it saw fit or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A judicial inquiry in this matter is not warranted. All the facts are in the public domain and were presened recently at length before a three day hearing of the Public Accounts Committee. With regard to the question of settlement criteria the position is that cases for trial have been selected <Col N="1411" /> on the basis that using internationally accepted criteria the individuals concerned had little or no handicap resulting from his hearing loss.  This decision is based on advice from senior counsel and made as early as the availability of the relevant facts allow.</P>
    <P>Despite the apparent attractiveness, a tribunal would, in the absence of an Irish Green Book and commensurate levels of quantum only produce an accelerated expenditure on these cases and could attract even more claims.  Consideration will be given to developing an alternative compensation mechanism when a uniform and reasonable level of damages acceptable to the State emerges.  The effecting of constitutional change to control expenditure on this matter remains an option which is under examination and which has not been ruled out.</P>
    <P>Army personnel exposure to noise from gunfire occurred on training ranges, the conduct of which was governed by various training instructions over the years.  In the early 1970s Amplivox &ldquo;Sonex&rdquo; soft plastic earplugs were purchased and regularly since then ear protection of increasing technical sophistication, over 200,000 pairs of ear defenders of various types, were made available on the ranges and later provided as a personal issue.  Until recent years, however, it has proved impossible, due to the lapse of time and the consequent unavailability of documentation, to present evidence in court to prove that an individual was provided with and required to wear ear protection on every occasion when attending the range.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 67, 78, 83, 105, 148, 156 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998, provided for special studies to be carried out on the Air Corps and the Naval Service. In July 1996, the Efficiency Audit Group engaged Price Waterhouse Management Consultants to conduct special studies into the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently <Col N="1414" /> furnished a preliminary draft report to the Efficiency Audit Group.  This draft report highlighted issues which required to be studied in greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.  As a consequence, rather than publishing a report that merely identified problems, it was decided that the consultants should further examine these problems in order to produce a report that was as comprehensive as possible and which could serve as the blueprint for the development of these important services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I understand the consultants have recently completed their study and are now in the process of submitting their final report to the Efficiency Audit Group.  Any matters arising from this review that come within the scope of representation will, of course, be the subject of full consultation with the representative associations.  Once again let me say that it is my firm intention to publish this report at the earliest possible juncture.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing levels, the position is that both the Air Corps and the Naval Service have lost members to other employments.  This situation is not unusual in times of economic buoyancy.  The Department will be advertising shortly for the recruitment of watchkeeping officers for the Naval Service where there is a shortage of these officers at present.  The recruitment competition will be open to all candidates, including any non-resident candidates who meet the eligibility criteria for the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 68 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.  In 1996, the Naval Service carried out five major drugs operations and these were co-ordinated with the joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service.  My Department does not have information in relation to the numbers that resulted in court appearances as the prosecution of personnel involved in such activities is a matter for the Garda.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving the prevention of illegal drug importation. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the joint task force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Naval Service is 1,015.  Arising from the recent recruitment campaign for enlishment in the Permanent Defence Force, 80 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in 1997.  A further 13 Naval cadets and four apprentices are undergoing training at present.  A special study of the Naval Service is being undertaking by the efficiency audit group as part of the review of the Defence Forces.  The question of the resources necessary to discharge the tasks assigned to the Naval Service will be encompassed by the study.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 77, 100, 101, 140, 190 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the questions, the survey in question was carried out on behalf of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and as such the results which were obtained are essentially a matter for the association. RACO has, however, done me the courtesy of drawing the survey results to my attention.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are going through an enormous reform process, the need for which is accepted by all.  The current restructuring programme cuts across all areas of military life and there will inevitably be major changes as the new organisation comes into operation.  While I believe that the implementation plan is essentially sound, a degree of change such as this naturally engenders a certain degree of anxiety while the organisation is in transition.  The members of RACO occupy the senior and middle management ranks of the Defence Forces and they have a right and duty to be concerned about the morale and image of their organisation.  I am concerned that comments in the media regarding claims for hearing damage should not take away from the well deserved reputation of members of the Defence Forces who have served the State so well over the years.</P>

      <P>The membership of the joint military and civilian steering group to oversee the study of the Reserve Defence Force has now been finalised and it has already held its first meeting.  The group is comprised of an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving FCA officer.  In October 1997, the Chief of Staff established a military board to conduct a special study of the Reserve Defence Force.  This board is required to consult with a consultative group consisting of members of the Reserve Defence Force. The consultative group, the members of which were nominated by the General Officers Commanding, Commands and the Flag Officer Commanding, Naval Service, comprises commissioned and non-commissioned officers from the four Commands and from the Slua Muirí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have not specified any deadlines in the steering group's terms of reference for the submission of an interim or final report I am confident that the group will conduct the study as quickly as possible and submit its recommendations at the earliest possible date.  In that regard I am advised by the military authorities that a considerable amount of preliminary work has already been undertaken by them.  For example, military boards have already sought the views of the members of the reserve on its future organisation and structure.  The military boards consulted with the members and sought submissions from them.  The boards completed this task last year and it is anticipated that the outputs from this work will be of considerable assistance to the steering group in its deliberations.  The study of the reserve will be wide-ranging and will examine such matters as the appropriate strengths of the various elements, equipment, training, etc.  Pending the completion of the study I do not intend to take any action in the meantime that would in <Col N="1420" /> any way pre-empt the recommendations of the steering group.</P>

      <P>On the 9 December 1997 at Kilworth firing range, an accident occurred during firing practices with a 60mm light mortar.  During the exercise, which was being conducted by Defence Forces personnel of the Southern Command, an explosion occurred in the vicinity of the gun position resulting in injuries to five personnel.  A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident and its deliberations are ongoing. The court of inquiry will encompass the findings of a Military Police investigation and a technical board of inquiry.  As part of the technical board of inquiry, a metallurgical analysis will be carried out.  The present stocks of 60mm mortars were purchased in 1954-55 and are part of the armament of all infantry battalions at home and the Irish battalion in Lebanon.  Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing but live firing for training purposes has, however, ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations.  Safety procedure for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during this exercise. These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>While not all officers may receive a rating on an annual basis under the formal appraisal system all officers are subject to some form of annual appraisal under the annual confidential reporting system.  For example, where an officer has served under a number of different commanding officers for periods of less than four months in each period or where an officer changes appointment the officer would be appraised under the annual confidential reporting system but would not be given an overall rating.  Likewise where an officer has served overseas during the year there would not be a formal appraisal rating but instead an overseas report would be completed.  Where an officer is being considered for promotion by an interview board and where the candidate has been under the command of a number of different commanding officers in a given year and has, therefore, not been given a rating, the interview board has available to it the reports of the various commanding officers to whom the candidate reported in the reporting year.  Such officers would not, therefore, be disadvantaged by the absence of an overall rating.</P>

      <P>The number of commissioned officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service at 31 December 1997, the latest date for which these figures are available, was Army &mdash; 1,111; Air Corps &mdash; 132 and Naval Service &mdash; 126.</P>
      <P>In 1992 a total of 24 non-commissioned personnel were appointed to commissioned rank in the Permanent Defence Force.  Of these, 14 were appointed to the Army, five to the Air Corps and six to the Naval Service.  In 1990 one non-commissioned officer was commissioned having completed a cadetship which was awarded through the annual cadetship competition in 1988.  One non-commissioned officer was appointed to commissioned rank in each of the years 1993, 1995 and 1997.  Each of these officers was assigned to the Army.  No non-commissioned personnel were appointed to commissioned rank in the years 1988 to 1991.</P>
      <P>Non-commissioned personnel serving in technical appointments who attain the required educational standard may be appointed to commissioned rank, to fill a vacancy for technical officer, provided that they satisfy an interview board as to their suitability.  Non-commissioned personnel may also be appointed to be officers on successful completion of a potential officers course.  Serving members of the Defence Forces may also compete in the annual cadetship competitions provided that they meet the criteria with regard to age, educational and medical standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 63, 75, 98, 108, 135, 162 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Defence Forces were among the first organisations to implement the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  A structure, which included a Defence Forces advisory committee on health and safety, was in place by 1990.  A report on the Defence Forces prepared by the Health and Safety Authority in 1994 complimented the Defence Forces on their work in the health and safety area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spending on health and safety is an integral part of the purchase of all items of equipment for the Defence Forces.  All items considered for purchase over the last ten years have been <Col N="1425" /> required to be of the appropriate British or European Union standards.  Health and safety is also an element of the protocol for acceptance testing of all equipment.  The Vote for Defence contains a provision for health and safety training and equipment and since 1995 the provision has been £30,000 in 1995 and 1996 and £40,000 in 1997 and 1998.  Safety statements for all units, which were drawn up in the 1990-91 period were revised in 1997.  The Defence Forces safety standards are also under review at present and it is anticipated that they will be produced in a new form by the end of this year.  All improvements have been budgeted for in advance.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation of the Defence Forces, as provided for in the Defence Forces review implementation plan, is taking place at present in consultation with all of the relevant authorities.  In the light of the wide-ranging nature of the re-organisation it is not possible to give an indication at this stage as to the number of personnel who will be engaged eventually on a full-time basis on health and safety matters.  In 1997, two health and safety courses, involving 60 to 65 students were held in the Eastern Command for the Reserve Defence Force.  These courses formed part of a pilot project and involved one day per month over a three-month period.  The syllabus for the courses included law, fire safety and manual handling.  A further such course is taking place at present in the Eastern Command and it is planned to hold a similar course in each of the other commands in the autumn.</P>

      <P>As the detailed information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.  At present there is a total of 749 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.  This figure includes 673 personnel who are serving with the United Nations: 51 personnel with the UN authorised Stabilisation Force in</P>
      <P>Bosnia and Herzegovina &mdash; SFOR; 13 personnel with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; OSCE and nine personnel with the European Community Monitor Mission &mdash; ECMM to the former Yugoslavia.  There is, in addition, one officer attached to each of the following: the Irish Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, the Irish Permanent Representation to the OSCE in Vienna and Ireland's Observer Delegation to the Western European Union &mdash; Western European Union &mdash; in Brussels.  The level of participation on overseas missions is kept under continual review in order to ensure that security needs at home can be met at all times and that the cost to the Defence Vote does not become excessive.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of personnel hours incurred by Defence Force personnel in the preparation and conduct of a recent court martial of an Army officer (details supplied); the total cost to the Defence Forces; his views on whether it is appropriate that relatively minor alleged breaches of discipline should require a full court martial; the plans, if any, the Defence Forces have for more appropriate procedures for dealing with these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The judicial process involved in the recent court martial of the Army officer concerned has not yet come to a conclusion.  The findings and sentence are subject to confirmation and promulgation. Under the Rules of Procedure (Defence Forces) 1954, as amended, a person convicted has the legal right to petition the Adjutant-General and ultimately the Minister against sentence.  This right of appeal arises after the appeal process in the Courts-Martial Appeal Court has been exhausted.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in the case at this stage.</P>
      <P>The total number of personnel hours incurred by Defence Force personnel in the preparation and conduct of the recent court martial is estimated at a total of 505 hours.  The time spent by military personnel in the preparation and conduct of courts martial is regarded as time spent in the ordinary course of duty.  Many of the military personnel involved are stationed in the Curragh and consequently there was no extra cost in connection with their attendance.  Details of actual claims for travel and subsistence from other personnel are not yet to hand.  The invoice in respect of fees for stenographer's services has not yet been received.</P>
      <P>Discipline in the Defence Forces is governed by the provisions of Part V Defence Act 1954 as amended and regulations and rules made thereunder.  Military law provides for the summary treatment of minor offences and for trial by court martial in relation to serious offences. Obedience to orders is integral to a soldier's whole existence.  Disobedience to orders is regarded as a serious offence, the more so when such offence is committed by a senior officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A court-martial is a court of law.  Its procedures are not unlike those followed in the civil courts. A person tried by court-martial can be represented by an officer of the Defence Forces, or by a civilian solicitor or barrister-at-law.  A right of appeal lies to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is composed of 1 Supreme Court Judge and 2 High Court Judges.  The Appeal Court has power to affirm or reverse the conviction in whole or in part and to remit, reduce or increase the sentence.  There is also provision for petitioning against sentence to the Adjutant-General of the Defence Forces and to the Minister <Col N="1428" /> for Defence.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court martial system as operated currently.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 69 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House, preliminary planning work has commenced in relation to the proposed White Paper on defence.  As the Deputies will appreciate, this is the first such White Paper and it is important that this planning phase is given sufficient emphasis.</P>
      <P>However, I also want the process as a whole to be completed within a reasonable time-frame. This time-frame must give adequate provision to complete the necessary planning work, consultative inputs, detailed consideration and finally drafting of the White Paper.  I am certain that the Deputies will wish to make an input to the process and I propose to bring my proposals in this regard to Government very shortly.  Briefly, I see the completion of the White Paper as falling within two phases: the first of these will provide for a consultative process in which all interested parties will have an opportunity to make a submission on any aspect of the White Paper.  Alongside this consultative phase there will be a reflective process in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the progress achieved to date in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces can be assessed.  The consultative phase will of course also provide for appropriate contact with the Defence Forces representative associations.  The main point will be that anyone who wishes to make an input to the process may take the opportunity that will be offered.</P>
      <P>While I have naturally been reluctant to indicate a specific date upon which the White Paper will be completed, particularly when it is the first of its kind and we have yet to see what issues are presented through the consultative process, I would hope to be in a position to put a draft for consideration by the Government by early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>The grading of keenness of hearing within the Defence Forces medical classification system is designed primarily for the purpose of diagnosing and classifying any hearing impairment to facilitate the implementation of an appropriate care of hearing programme.  Screening audiometry is conducted in accordance with the methods and parameters prescribed in the Health and Safety Authority's Guidelines on Hearing Checks and Audiometry issued pursuant to the (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations 1990 (S.  I. No. 157 of 1990) and requires unaided air conduction audiometry.  The use of hearing aids would defeat its stated purpose and in any case the minimum standard of keenness of hearing required for retention in the Defence Fores is related to hearing loss in the lower tones which are related to the ability to hear verbal sounds. The provision of high tone or microchip tonespecific aids, still in their early stage of development, would be of no value.  Under the Defence Force regulations, no one suffering from high tone loss alone would be discharged from the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 152 and 185 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years considerable sums have been <Col N="1430" /> expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and up-graded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Some of the more important developments in 1997 in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment were:</P>
    <P>a contract for a new fishery patrol vessel, for delivery in 1999;</P>
    <P>a contract for the supply of new turrets and fire directing systems for fitting, during 1998 and 1999, to existing armoured cars;</P>
    <P>a contract for the purchase of refurbished 105mm.  light artillery guns, for delivery in 1998, to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete;</P>
    <P>a contract for the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of nearly £10 million;</P>
    <P>expenditure of approximately £3 million on new troop carrying vehicles.</P>
    <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under cosideration in my Department at present.  A project team has been established comprising civilian and military personnel and has been tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  Procurement of APC's will be undertaken by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that commencing in 1999 there will be net pay savings of the order of £15 million a year arising from the reduction in the strength of the permanent defence force.  It has been agreed that from 1999 onwards 50 per cent of the pay savings will be made available to provide additional funding for equipment and infrastructural programmes for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 76, 118 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>Defence Force regulations prescribe that an allowance, the current rate of which is £320, is payable to a person who has been appointed to be an officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil towards the cost of providing himself with a tunic and one trousers of officers' pattern standard.  The rate of allowance is revised from time to time on foot of claims submitted by the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) through the Deparment's conciliation and arbitration machinery.  All other items of officers' pattern clothing are issuable to officers of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil at the public expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of allowance were last increased with effect from 1 January 1996 following a claim presented by the representative association.  It is open to the representative association at any time <Col N="1432" /> to present a further claim for a review of the rates payable.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996.  These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place, in May of this year.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts, a former member of the Permanent Defence Force may, following retirement, apply for a disability pension in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or an injury attributable to military service, whether at home or abroad, or to a disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with a United Nations force.  Application for a pension in respect of noise-induced hearing loss must be made within one year after retirement.  The minimum degree of disablement required to qualify for a pension under this heading is 20 per cent; a gratuity may be payable where the degree of disablement is less than 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Those Acts also provide that any compensation received by a person in respect of a particular disablement may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of disability pension-gratuity for the same disabelment.  This provision applies whether the compensation is received before or after the award of the disability pension-gratuity. It is considered that the majority of the litigants in relation to hearing loss would be precluded at this stage from applying for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts either because the statutory time limit for making application has expired or because they are still serving members of the Permanent Defence Force.  While there has been an upward swing in the number of disability pension applications for loss of hearing in the past couple of years &mdash; which totalled about 100 in 1997 &mdash; the numbers involved are not significant in the context of the overall number of personnel injury claims.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>The representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, RACO and PDFORRA operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is accepted that such systems have traditionally been adversarial in nature and did not lend themselves easily to the management of change.  The Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness advocates building more open, co-operative processes on existing arrangements.  In the context of both the process of re-organisation of the Defence Forces and Partnership 2000 I have asked the Secretary General of the Department to develop proposals on providing a forum in which to develop joint ownership of change.  Such structures would, of course, complement the existing conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>Consideration is still being given to proposed partnership structures for RACO and PDFORRA and I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of that examination.  In general, I believe employment relationships can be very much improved by an acceptance by both sides that substantial support of each other is necessary to make progress.  Both sides must accept also that each has a legitimate role and interest in the organisation.  Such steps should lead to higher levels of mutual respect for and trust in each others positions.  This approach has already been warmly welcomed by PDFORRA representatives who regard it as &ldquo;a major breakthrough&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan 1996-98 adopted by the Government in February 1996 stated that a military hospital providing general medical, surgical, some specialist services and medical supplies would be located at St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical support in the Curragh Camp will be provided by a military medical facility which will continue to supply out-patient medical and occupational <Col N="1438" /> services, including dental and pharmacy services.  The facility will also have an infirmary.</P>
    <P>Cork Military Hospital will also become a military medical facility which will continue to provide the present out-patient services and will have a small infirmary.</P>
    <P>Average bed occupancy at St. Bricin's Hospital varies between 20 and 40 patients.  The hospital is neither equipped nor staffed to provide services other than those which it provides at present. However, any proposal that might lead to an increase in the utilisation of the hospital's facilities without additional expenditure being incurred by my Department would receive serious consideration.</P>

      <P>As part of the answer is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There are significant differences between the Irish and British court martial systems.  Irish military personnel, in common with all other citizens, have rights arising from our written Constitution. This constitional jurisprudence has been applied increasingly in the military legal sphere in recent years.  Also, the Courts Martial Appeal Court, which is a civil court, has full appellate jurisdiction over the finding and sentence of any court martial.  It is considered that our court martial system conforms with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court martial system as operated currently.</P>
      <P>The details of any changes that may be taking place in the British court marital system are not yet to hand.  However, when these become available they will have full consideration in my Department and if it is considered that some changes in our system might be desirable, then these changes will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>During the past four years the Naval Service has been invited to participate in an annual exercise conducted by the United States naval authorities in conjunction with European nations in the Baltic Sea.  In each of the years, 1994, 1995 and 1997 a Naval Service representative attended the exercise as an observer.  Invitations were received for a Naval Service vessel to participate in the 1997 and 1998 exercises.  It was not possible to accede to these invitations for a number of reasons but principally due to Naval Service operational commitments.  I am agreeable, however, to again send a Naval Service officer in an observer capacity to the 1998 exercise.</P>

      <P>I can advise the Deputy that there are no proposals currently for the State to buy out commercial salmon licences on the River Boyne or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>My immediate policy priority is to continue with the implementation of new salmon conservation and management strategies which will ensure the survival and restoration of salmon stocks in their own right and in the interests of all legitimate stakeholders in the resource.  A key component of those strategies is the move to the catchment management approach.  Within that framework the localised requirements and concerns of commercial and recreational fishermen will be addressed through participation and involvement in conservation and development plans for the resource.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the UK Presidency has revisited a proposal by the EU Commission of some years standing and is proposing a ban on the use of driftnets in certain fisheries including the albacore tuna fishery.  The UK proposal does not include driftnetting for salmon.</P>
      <P>I am strongly opposing the UK proposal.  The tuna fishery is a very important regional fishery for the south west.  I do not accept that there is an objective scientific justification for such a ban. The Irish position has been spelled out to the Commission and to the UK Presidency in discussions to date in EU fora and in bilateral discussions at official level.  I am writing to underline my position to Commissioner Bonino and to Minister Cunningham whom I intend to meet bilaterally on the issue in advance of the Fisheries Council next month.  The fishing industry representatives have been fully briefed and are being kept advised of developments.  I will continue to work with the Irish fishing industry, and with like minded colleagues in the EU, notably France, to ensure a satisfactory outcome on this issue for Ireland.</P>

      <P>My intention for the conference is that it will offer an opportunity for an open and honest debate around the issues which have been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Children, and the Environment and Local Government, has assembled a panel of recognised international experts who will, in addition to sharing their expert knowledge of the issues involved, approach the subject matter from the view point <Col N="1444" /> of the local representative or official or concerned individual.</P>
    <P>The target audience for the conference is very wide and includes local authorities, health boards, Government Departments, and the communications industry itself.  The conference is also aimed at concerned individuals and community groups.  To facilitate these community groups, a special subsidised delegate rate of £75 per person is available.  Full conference rates range from £200 to £350 per delegate.  These rates include documentation, lunch and refreshments.</P>
    <P>Conference brochures have issued to a very wide range of organisations and individuals and the conference has been widely reported on in the media.  Full conference details are available on the Department's website and copies of the conference papers will be available afterwards, as will a video of the procedings.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the conference are at an advanced stage and bookings have already been received from a wide range of organisations and individuals.  I am glad to report that a wide range of public representatives, including many from local authorities, have already signed up.</P>
    <P>As the total number of places available is limited and as it is important that there is a wide ranging representation from the different interests, I consider that the arrangement for subsidised fees for community groups offers the best way forward.</P>

      <P>The position is that the previous Government decided that the provision of a second commercial airport in the Dublin area would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally and nothing has happened in the interim which would warrant a change in that decision.  Casement Aerodrome is the main military airbase in the State and as long as the bulk of military flying operations are conducted there, in particular basic flying training flights, the base could not be considered suitable for use as a commercial airport with scheduled services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>Preliminary planning work has commenced in relation to the proposed White Paper on Defence.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this is the first such White Paper and it is important that this planning phase is given sufficient emphasis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I also want the process as a whole to be completed within a reasonable time-frame. Adequate provision must be made to complete the necessary planning work, consultative inputs, detailed consideration and, finally, drafting of the White Paper.  I see the completion of the White Paper as falling within two phases: the first of these will provide for a consultative process in which all interested parties will have an opportunity <Col N="1448" /> to make a submission on any aspect of the White Paper.  Alongside this consultative phase there will be a reflective process in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the progress achieved to date in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces can be assessed. The consultative phase will, of course, also provide for appropriate contact with the Defence Forces representative associations.  The main point will be that anyone who wishes to make an input to the process may take the opportunity that will be offered.</P>
    <P>While I have naturally been reluctant to indicate a specific date upon which the White Paper will be completed, particularly when it is the first of its kind and we have yet to see what issues are presented through the consultative process, I hope to be in a position to put a draft for consideration by the Government by early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the alleged original offences occurred in Northern Ireland, it is for the authorities in that jurisdiction to take the primary action to address this problem.  I am extremely concerned about any possible risks to Irish consumers arising from breaches of the relevant UK rules and my Department has expressed such concerns to counterparts in the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  I understand that the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland are currently dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of offences under our legislation which would arise from illegal importation and use of such medicines in this country. In this regard, I would point to the relevant controls in our legislation, particularly those which impose an obligation on farmers to keep records in a specified form, <i>inter alia,</i> of all prescription medicines used.  Where unauthorised use of medicines is detected as a result of such controls, I am committed to ensuring that the full rigours of the law are used against the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it should be noted that my Department has in place a comprehensive monitoring programme at plant level to detect the presence of illegal residues.  In the case of clenbuterol <Col N="1450" /> and antibiotics, which were a focus of the newspaper article concerned, our monitoring is particularly intense, with in excess of 120,000 samples taken during the course of 1997, which goes well beyond the minimum levels demanded under EU legislation.</P>
    <P>Full follow-up action is taken at farm level on the basis of &ldquo;positives&rdquo; detected under this monitoring programme; such investigations are faciliated by the on-farm record keeping obligations to which I have already referred.  A measure of my Department's commitment and success in terms of enforcement is the number of convictions secured in recent years, with 135 people receiving fines totalling almost £0.5 million since the beginning of 1996.  Thirty-seven of these people were, in addition, sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Following reports in January that beef was being sold door to door from vans in the Galway area, inspectors of my Department visited a premises in County Galway on 16 January to interview the owner.  The owner claimed that the beef was of Brazilian origin and was imported <i>via</i> the UK.  A detention notice in respect of the beef and other frozen meat, i.e., lamb and poultry, found on the premises was served on the owner pending further investigations.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of the documents which accompanied the beef to Ireland and of the circumstances surrounding the importation provided no evidence of the origin of the beef, which was packed in unmarked boxes.  Examination of the documents accompanying the other meat consignments revealed that the import conditions, and in particular the requirement that the establishment of origin be EU approved, were not complied with.  Consequently, inspectors of my Department visited the premises again on 20 January and seized and removed all of the meat from the premises.  In addition, the importer was instructed to recall any meat which had been distributed to customers.  The meat is currently stored under the control of my Department while the question of prosecution proceedings against the importer is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his report for 1996 the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted a number of deficiencies in the overall control procedures associated with the operation of the headage and premia schemes by my Department.  The main deficiencies highlighted were perceived to be: inadequate controls over cattle identity; inadequate controls over herdnumbers in the administration of payments; deficiencies associated with the introduction of the Land Parcel Identification System for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence that the deficiencies highlighted led to fraudulent abuse of the scheme by farmers.  The main thrust of the Comptroller and <Col N="1452" /> Auditor General's report related to the need to tighten up controls in specific areas.</P>
    <P>In his replies to audit queries from the Comptroller and Auditor General and in his subsequent evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts the accounting officer of my Department outlined the steps which have been taken or which are to be taken to address the particular difficulties.  In particular the accounting officer outlined the measures which had been taken to control payments since the introduction of the CAP reform arrangements with effect from 1993 including the increased reliance on information technology in the processing of payments.  In so far as cattle identity is concerned my Department has complied fully with an EU directive on the identification and registration of bovine animals. A new cattle identification system was introduced in Ireland in 1996 in accordance with Council Directive 92/102.  While not strictly required under the directive the system introduced in Ireland included a computerised birth registration system for all bovine animals.  This database is now being used in the processing of headage and premium applications.  My Department is in the process of introducing a computerised movement monitoring system in the context of the national beef assurance scheme.  The CMMS will bring together all data relating to bovine animal events such as birth details, herd location at time of premium headage claim and of certain disease tests, slaughter or export details as well as information on movements between the various locations, in particular inter-herd movements.  The redevelopment of my Department's accounts system is in progress including the introduction of a computerised client database, details of which were outlined to the Committee of Public Accounts. The introduction of the client database will address the difficulties highlighted with the current herdnumber based payments system.</P>
    <P>A Land Parcel Identification System has been set up using mainly Ordnance Survey maps submitted by farmers showing their land parcels in 1993, 1994 and 1995.  The intention was to capture on a computer database, and number uniquely, parcels of land which would have reasonably stable boundaries from year to year.  It was never the intention that this exercise would be used to control 1995 area aid applications and the EU recognised that the task was so large that it could not be completed in time to be so used.  The EU originally required all member states to have a land parcel identification system in place by 1 January 1996 but, recognising the problems facing member states, including Ireland, extended the implementation date to 1 January 1997.</P>

      <P>Since 1 July 1996, 106 persons have been convicted of offences relating to illegal growth promoters, of whom 94 were farmers.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) 894/96, which applies to offences occurring since 1 July 1996, provides for the exclusion of producers from the cattle premia and headage schemes for certain breaches of animal remedies legislation.  It should be noted that under the EU legislation, a person must be excluded from these schemes once the breach has been established.</P>
      <P>This administrative sanction has been applied in 18 cases, which constitute the total number of such breaches occurring since 1 July 1996.  In only two of these cases has the matter come to trial at this stage.</P>

      <P>The 1992 CAP reform measures which switched the emphasis from market supports to direct payments had the effect of getting support more directly to producers as well as containing a bias in favour of small and medium sized producers. Overall the reform package has been favourable to Irish agriculture.</P>

The detailed aspects will not be presented by the Commission until the end of next month.

      <P>Ireland's current quota for special beef premium is some 1,002,000, down approximately 250,000 quota rights from previous years.  This reduction arose from a decision by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996.  Eligibility is determined by reference to the number of animals eligible for payment of the ten month instalment of the premium.  While definitive figures on eligibility will not be available before April, 1998 at the earliest, indications at present are that the quota has been exceeded by the same 6.5 per cent.  The level of payment of both ten and 22 month special beef premium, and extensification premium where relevant, will be reduced accordingly. The adjusted rate for 1997 special beef premium will be of the order of £84.31, a reduction of £5.86.</P>
      <P>As regards 1998, it is far too early at this stage to predict the definitive outcome, as applications for the ten months instalment may be made up to 4 December 1998.</P>

      <P>Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2066/92 defines that a suckler cow shall mean &ldquo;(i) a cow belonging to a meat breed &mdash; and belonging to a herd intended for rearing calves for meat production and (ii) an in-calf heifer, meeting the same criteria, which replaces a suckler cow&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any cow that has calved at least once prior to the date of application is eligible to be applied on under the suckler cow premium scheme.  All animals applied on or any suitable replacements must be maintained on the holding of the applicant for six calendar months starting on the day after the application is received by my Department. <Col N="1456" /> A suitable replacement is defined as another eligible suckler cow or in-calf heifer.</P>
    <P>The replacement rate is not limited by regulation. However the regulation requires that the cows applied on are part of a herd intended for rearing calves for meat production.  The standard replacement rate for a suckler cow enterprise is 20 per cent of the cows in the herd.  If the replacement rate in any herd appears excessive then it is necessary for my Department to carry out further checks to ensure that the cows applied on were indeed part of a suckler cow herd as defined by the regulation.</P>

The figure for the first ten months of 1997 represents 24 per cent of total Irish exports, while 39 per cent of our exports were to potential EMU participants for the same period; the corresponding figures for the calendar year 1996 were almost 25 per cent and 40 per cent respectively.  Irish exporters will benefit from the further development and integration of the Single Market which Economic and Monetary Union, (EMU), will represent; in EMU <Col N="1457" /> trade between EMU participants will not be affected by exchange rate movements as all participants will have the euro as their currency.</P>
      <P>Exports to the United Kingdom, or inded any other country, are at any particular time affected by a number of factors, including competitive position, product advantage, price and exchange rate movements.  These factors are likely to continue to affect Irish trade with the United Kingdom both before and after EMU begins.</P>
      <P>In any case, it should be remembered that the study by the Economic and Social Research Institute entitled &ldquo;Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU&rdquo; concluded that irrespective of whether the United Kingdom joins or not, membership of EMU will on balance be of benefit to Ireland.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware a methadone treatment services review group was set up by my Department in January 1997.  Its brief was to assess the use of methadone in the treatment of optiate dependence.  The group's report examines the protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and points to appropriate controls which might be put in place.  It also sets out the basis on which methadone treatment should continue to be developed and recommends a concise framework for the future operation of the scheme.  The report has been circulated nation-wide to every general practitioner and pharmacist.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the report is that supervised administration of methadone be available where a general practitioner feels the need for this.  This facility is being put in place, as the Deputy points out, to avoid possible abuses by clients.  As set out in the report information on the handling of methadone and on supervised consumption will issue to pharmacists to ensure the smooth running of this element of the scheme.  As the scheme develops it is intended that the liaison pharmacists employed by the Eastern Health Board will link with the board in making arrangements with each pharmacy, as required, to facilitate a supervised consumption service.</P>

      <P>I have not to date instituted legal proceedings against tobacco companies.  My officials are monitoring the litigation in the United States and other jurisdications and I have established a group of senior health personnel to advise me on this matter.  I have not made a final determination on the matter.</P>
      <P>There have been no discussions on this specific item at the Council of Health Ministers though I intend to raise the matter at the next Council.  It would be helpful to have a European approach to this matter if that were possible.  I have recently agreed new anti-smoking measures at European level involving a ban on advertising and sponsorship.  While much of these measures already exist in Ireland a European-wide application of these restrictions will have a much more significant effect.</P>

      <P>The total number of beds at Naas General Hospital is 129 and can be broken down as follows: in-patient beds &mdash; medical, 55; surgical, 32; coronary care, four; intensive care, two; acute psychiatric, 30; day beds &mdash; medical and surgical, six.  In addition, accommodation for 13 patients is available in the observation ward.</P>
      <P>During the period 1 January to 31 December 1997 the average number of admissions per month for each speciality was as follows: medical, 218; surgical, 135; coronary care, 34; intensive care, 15; acute pscychiatric, 37.</P>
      <P>On the morning of 24 February 1998 a total of 39 patients were accommodated in other than standard hospital beds.  These patients were accommodated as follows: observation ward, 13; day ward, six; day room, six; A&amp;E department, 14.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the Eastern Health Board undertook the following initiatives to alleviate difficulties experienced at Naas General Hospital.  These included: the provision of a dedicated day ward &mdash; six beds &mdash; to enable the more efficient and effective use of in-patient beds; the provision of an observation unit adjacent to the A&amp;E with accommodation for up to 13 patients; the appointment of a bed manager to ensure the most effective use of the acute hospital bed resource; the creation of two additional consultant posts and two non-consultant hospital doctor positions to enhance medical cover at the hospital; and the nursing staff complement of the hospital was increased by 13.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional beds at the hospital will ensure the availability of complementary facilities to medical and surgical patients from the Naas area who will have completed specialised treatment in Tallaght Hospital and will require a further period of recovery in a hospital setting. This will also help to relieve the overall pressure on acute hospital bed provision in the area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently approved a revised phase II development brief for this hospital.  This brief has now been extended, as compared with the original proposal, to incorprate the following: additional general medical and surgical ward (31 beds); department of medicine for the elderly; day services unit; department of radiology; operating department; and department of physical medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised phase II development will provide enhanced rehabilitation services and ensure more effective and efficient discharge planning of <Col N="1462" /> patients.  The cost of accommodating the above changes is estimated at £18 million &mdash; construction costs &mdash; as compared with the previous construction cost limit of £11.63 million.  This will bring the overall cost of the project &mdash; including fees and equipping &mdash; to a figure in the region of £26 million &mdash; at May 1996 prices.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Child Care Act, 1991, has been operational in full since the end of 1996.  The purpose of this legislation was to update the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, sexually abused or who are at risk.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Act are: the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection; strengthening of the powers of the health boards to provide child care and family support services; and improved procedures to facilitate immediate intervention by health boards and the gardaí where children are in serious danger; revised provisions to enable the courts to place in the care of or under the supervision of health boards children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk; introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services; and revised provisions in relation to the registration and inspection of residential centres for children.  There are also four sets of details regulations under the Act.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a social services inspectorate is a priority for the Government.  It has been decided to proceed with the inspectorate on an administrative basis initially and it will be located within the Department of Health and Children.  The existing general powers of the Minister for Health and Children and specific powers provided in section 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991, will underpin this administrative arrangement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, each health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, is the body with statutory responsibility for child care and protection.  Local complaints procedures already exist and some health boards have had independent investigations conducted where there were serious concerns about the handling of specific child abuse cases.</P>

      <P>Under section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, it is a function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection and in performing this function a health board is obliged to &ldquo;take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In implementing the Child Care Act, 1991, all health boards have carried out extensive training programmes for staff.  In addition, each health board has published or is in the process of publishing its own child protection guidelines which conform to the national guidelines issued by my Department. These guidelines were drawn up by the health boards in consultation with relevant staff groups. The purpose of the guidelines is to protect vulnerable children by providing relevant staff with guidelines on the detection and inter-agency management of situations where abuse or neglect is evident or suspected.  The Deputy may be aware that I have recently established a working group to review the national child abuse guidelines.</P>

      <P>The new local government fund which I recently announced will provide significant additional resources for local authorities.  The fund will be disbursed to individual local authorities on a basis which equalises needs and resources of the different authorities.  A pilot needs and resources study is currently under way in Galway.  The purpose of the study is to produce a set of indicators that will facilitate the measurement of the needs and resources of individual local authorities. The study will examine the provision of all services including planning and rural water supplies.  It is my intention that funds should be distributed from the local government fund from 1999 onwards by reference to the criteria that emerge from this study.</P>
      <P>An allocation towards the administrative costs of implementing the new measures introduced under the rural water programme was made to local authorities in July 1997.  Allocations for 1998 will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, recognises the value of habitats such as hedgerows for nesting birds and other wildlife and provides protection subject to certain execeptions, against the cutting, grubbing, burning, etc., of any vegetation on uncultivated land during the period 15 April to 31 August.  The provisions of section 40 against the cutting, grubbing, burning, etc., are enforced by the ranger staff of Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, and it is the policy to prosecute offenders when the necessary evidence is available to bring a prosecution under the Act.  However, tracing the source of fires on mountainous areas and catching offenders make the enforcement of these provisions difficult and there have been no prosecutions under this section of the Act in recent times.</P>

      <P>In the context of discussions with the farming organisations on the introduction of SACs, it was agreed that compensation be available either through REPS, which will provide standard rate top-ups for those with SAC land, or by claiming for actual losses from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has offered compensation payment of £1,000 per acre for the purchase of turbary rights or relocation to another bog where <Col N="1471" /> this is available with £100 per mile once-off payment &mdash; subject to a maximum payment of £500 &mdash; where extra travel is involved.</P>
    <P>The concept of market value as a basis for assessing compensation payable was explicitly accepted in December 1996 by the farming organisations &mdash; IFA/ICMSA &mdash; as a fair basis for compensation in the context of Partnership 2000, where the agreed text reads &ldquo;the Government agrees that a fair and proper level of compensation shall be paid having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC/SPA designations and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SAC/SPA&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office, I have at all times insisted that no stone should be left unturned in making the SAC process acceptable to those affected.  Apart altogether from my commitment to fairness, it is my firm belief that conservation cannot work unless local people willingly accept it and co-operate with the effort.</P>
    <P>In that context, while accepting the validity of the offer already made, I have asked my officials to again look at the situation, to see what elements of a package might be seen to meet the individual circumstances that arise in this area.</P>

      <P>I have not received any proposals to extend the rural community policing scheme in County Limerick or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 333 tabled by the Deputy on 25 November last, the Garda Commissioner, as part of his evaluation and review of the scheme, recently decided to introduce trial modifications, under a pilot test arrangement, in two of the 14 Garda districts in which the scheme currently operates.  The Garda districts selected by the Commissioner for this purpose are Nenagh and Newcastlewest.  I understand from the Garda authorities that these pilot arrangements, the nature of which I outlined in my earlier reply to the Deputy, commenced in the two districts on 23 February.</P>
      <P>The trial changes, aimed at enhancing the operational effectiveness of the scheme, are intended to facilitate further study of the community policing initiative in the context of the review of the entire scheme.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary community organisations in the provision of improvement to and equipping of recreational, leisure and community facilities, including swimming pools and environmental works.  Under the major facilities scheme, proposals for funding for the construction of community swimmimg pools can be considered where they form part of a major sports facility at national, regional and local level.</P>

However, my overall strategy for sport includes encouraging the promotion of standards of good conduct and fair play in sport. In this context, the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland, which is promulgated by my Department, expects national governing bodies to ensure that all children are treated in an equitable and fair manner regardless of age, ability, sex, religion, social and ethnic background or poitical persuasion.</P>

      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputies approached my Department in 1996 with a proposal for a possible amalgamation of the three schools.  In February 1997, the schools agreed in principle to amalgamate.  The agreement is dependent on a major programme of renovation and improvement works at the schools.</P>

      <P>Due to the current level of contractual commitments, it is not possible to approve funding for improvement works at the school referred to by the Deputy.  There is a significant backlog of projects requiring funding and, as there is a continuing need to keep a tight control on public spending, it is not possible for all deserving projects to proceed simultaneously.  The needs of the school will be considered in the light of future capital allocations.</P>
      <P>A new devolved grant scheme came into operation last year under which each national school is paid a basic annual grant of £2,000, plus £9 per pupil, for spending on improvement works to buildings, grounds, services and furnishings.  This year's allocation was forwarded to the school this month and it may use the funding to carry out some of the required improvement works.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the students support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in Northern Ireland.  In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member stares, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his/her course.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
