      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question which will enable the Taoiseach to respond.  To make progress on the British-Irish Agreement the House and the Government are committed to introducing various legislative measures.  When will the Government introduce the legislation to establish the human rights commission and when will the Equal Status Bill and the legislation required to amend the Nationality and Citizenship Act be introduced?  Does the Taoiseach consider that manifest and overt progress in these areas would advance the current impasse on decommissioning?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that legislation to establish the human rights commission will be ready prior to Christmas.  It is currently being drafted and I hope it will be ready in early December.  I also hope some of the other measures will be ready before Christmas.  It is highly likely I will return to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the resources to meet this legislative workload given that it is already committed to producing 22 Bills, some of which we doubt we will ever see?  Is he also satisfied that, given the need to make urgent progress on the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, he can meet the timetable he has outlined, whereby the text of the human rights legislation will be published within eight weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement announcing the various measures indicated that legislation connected with the British-Irish Agreement would get absolute priority.  If the legislation was to take its normal course in the queue it would not be ready, but I asked at that time that it would get absolute priority.  That is the position.  It is the only way we will get this legislation up and running. It will also include the legislation on North-South bodies, which is the subject of questions put down for Question Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill to be introduced?  Does he intend to introduce any proposals on a new Bretton Woods agreement which is required by the world at large?  Could he also indicate if he will guarantee that our commitments to overseas development aid will rise this year as a proportion of GDP, rather than fall, which was the fear expressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, in a speech she made on Monday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation on the Bretton Woods agreements was raised yesterday.  It is suggested that parliamentary approval be obtained for the payment by Ireland of a contribution to the enhanced structure adjustment facility.  I hope the legislation will be ready before Christmas, but it may not be taken before then.  It is a short Bill and if it is ready it could perhaps be passed by the House.  The other matter is for the Estimates process.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Supreme Court lifted a High Court direction that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would notify 3,000 non-residents in respect of gun licences issued to them.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to clarify section 12 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, where instruction in the use of firearms is an offence against the State?  We are in the middle of the game shooting season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question on legislation.  Holders of legitimately held licences who give proper instruction to members of their families in the use of firearms, should not be deemed guilty of an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1988.  Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform clarify that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that Ireland faces a bill for up to £2.3 billion because of our failure to meet carbon dioxide reductions under the quota agreement, will the Taoiseach make time available to discuss the Buenos Aires summit, which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will be attending?</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his correspondence relating to the Arhus Convention.  Am I right in thinking that there are three pillars, which the Taoiseach himself has referred to?  Will we require legislation from the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in order to ratify that agreement?  When can we expect that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote to the Deputy on that issue suggesting that he should take it up directly with the Ministers concerned.  The Buenos Aires summit will take place on 10 and 11 November.  I am sure the Minster will agree to report to the House on the outcome of that summit.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill.  Yesterday we read of a survey that showed one in five pupils regularly miss attendance at vocational or community schools.  It is quite clear that current policies to tackle educational disadvantage are failing.  What action will be taken and when will we see the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill?  Will it specifically do something for these large numbers of children who are dropping out of school early, are not attending regularly and for whom the education system is not delivering an adequate response?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Educational Training Qualifications Bill will be ready before the end of 1998, if possible.  If not, it may run into January. The Minister for Education and Science has already passed the heads of the School Attendance Bill.  Legislation is being drafted in those areas, so both issues are relevant to the question the Deputy posed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the promised legislation on the human rights commission, the Taoiseach agreed that the heads of the Bill could go to the relevant committee.  In view of the timeframe he has enunciated, will the Taoiseach abide by that commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question with the Taoiseach before.  Prior to its publication, I asked that the heads of the Bill be brought to the relevant committee because there is a lot of public interest, and indeed international interest, in this <Col N="6" /> legislation.  At the time, the Taoiseach kindly replied to me in the affirmative &mdash; that he would be willing to allow the heads of the Bill to go before the relevant committee.  Is the Taoiseach willing to abide by that commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember giving that commitment on the Order of Business, but if I did so, I will certainly honour it.  I do not remember the Deputy asking me that on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember it clearly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is time to do that, I do not have a difficulty about the heads going in front of the Bill.  I think the heads are almost available.  I will talk to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <P>When will the McKinsey report on the beef industry be published?  When will the Minister for Agriculture and Food open Hume House for the area aid submissions?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the revolt in rural areas because farmers can neither visit nor ring the area aid unit at Hume House?  That is contrary to the Freedom of Information Act because it basically means that people cannot see their own private data.  Is the Taoiseach aware that is going on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the questions are strictly about legislation.  However, last week, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced the establishment of a task force in the beef industry. The objective of the task force is to devise an action plan to deal with the major problems facing the industry.  Some of these problems concerning <Col N="7" /> over capacity and the need for rationalisation have been examined in a report on the beef industry, which has just been completed by McKinsey consultants, which the Deputy referred to, on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other problems concerning a quality based payments scheme have been addressed in the context of the tripartite group composed of representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the IDA and the meat factories.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food believes that in view of the need to address all the problems facing the beef industry at present, and in the context of Agenda 2000, it is important that the task force should be established immediately to prepare the action plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House long but I have some brief observations to make because my amendments were ruled out of order.  This <Col N="11" /> legislation has been facilitated in its expeditious passage through the House.  More important legislation to do with the haulage sector was published in March 1997 in relation to consigner liability. I refer to the Road Transport Bill.  I would like to know the date on which that will be put in place.  I would also like the Minister to follow up on what we discussed on Committee Stage in relation to its implementation because there is a plethora of regulations relating to tachographs, road traffic, and different aspects of haulage from which the black economy is still thriving and in respect of which there is no effective implementation. I would like to know when this Bill will come into operation, before it passes.  I would like to know what resources will be put in place and whether the Minister will give real consideration in the context of the current review to putting in place a haulage traffic corps &mdash; I understand there is, operating out of Naas and elsewhere, a special Garda traffic corps &mdash; to deal with all the enforcement aspects, including the carriage of dangerous substances.</P>
      <P>To summarise, I want to know when this will be implemented, how it will be enforced and whether the Minister will establish the special cohort of staff that I have sought so that we will have a level playing field in the haulage industry, because if rates are to be undercut it will lead to the self-destruction of a very competitive industry that is vital to our overall economic performance.  We are an island economy and we need to move goods to and from the island.  This must be at the centre of economic planning and management.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on the efficient manner in which he has brought the Bill before the House and steered it though Second and Committee Stages.  It is important legislation which should have been introduced a number of years ago because it has direct and crucial relevance to the lives of citizens.  I represent an area not far from Dublin Airport and Dublin Port, where there is massive movement of heavy goods vehicles, often with dangerous cargoes, through housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will now be implemented by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A large part of her remit will consist of ensuring <Col N="12" /> it is carried through.  However, it is important, especially in the area of health and safety and because of ongoing serious complaints about lack of resources, that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, makes it his business, with the Minister, Deputy Harney, to ensure in forthcoming final discussions on the budget that sufficient resources are put in place to implement the praiseworthy ideas in the legislation.  It is crucial that there be sufficient personnel in the areas of inspection and health and safety to ensure the safety of workers in heavy transport and of the population through whose areas heavy goods vehicles move.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Jacob, on a job well done.</P>

      <P>At the risk of attracting the ire of the Ceann Comhairle, I will endeavour to answer some of the questions posed by Deputy Yates.  I thank Deputy Broughan for his kind remarks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates was obviously referring to the Road Transport Bill which was introduced earlier. When I came to office, I found a number of inadequacies in it which is why we went back to the drawing board with it to ensure it was adequate when brought before the House.  I expect it will be introduced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be published this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to have it published this session and everyone in the Department is working towards that, especially bearing in mind the matter of consignor liability.  I am glad Deputy Yates now agrees with me on that because the consignor liability issue was conspicuous by its absence from the previous legislation. That was one of the reasons we re-examined the Bill to make it more comprehensive and to include in it a liability for and onus on consignors. All in the House should be pleased with the legislation for that reason.  It cannot be passed quickly enough as far as I am concerned and Deputy Broughan's comments would apply in that regard.  It should be passed quickly in the interests of fair play in the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan mentioned the situation which exists in Dublin Port and that is part of the overall situation regarding road haulage.  I compliment the Irish Road Haulage Association for its responsible approach earlier this summer when there was a threatened blockade during the Tall Ships visit.  That responsible approach should be adhered to and rewarded by the House taking up the cudgel on the legislation and implementing it quickly.  Regarding the safety and enforcement aspects of the legislation, they will be implemented and will introduce to the country the high standards which are expected and which obtain in other countries in the carriage of dangerous goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment concerns the inspectorate and requests that it produce an annual report on its works and findings on the strengths and weaknesses of the education system. This goes to the core of the business of an inspectorate.  It should not just be an internal briefing for the Minister but should also work on key quality issues in the education system.  It should examine issues such as the level of literacy performance, the success of science and mathematics and the successful transition of children from primary to secondary school.  What marks out our education system is the remarkable lack of a systematic collection of information about any of these issues.  Were it not for the OECD and others exerting pressure occasionally on the Department to conduct surveys, information would rarely be systematically collected, particularly on the proper placement of children with <Col N="14" /> special needs.  It is a serious weakness that we do not seem to find it necessary to systematically collect information to allow policy makers make informed decisions.  This handicaps every occupant of the Minister's office.</P>
      <P>This is a good opportunity to rectify that matter and to ensure the inspectorate will be a vehicle for reform through the systematic collection and publication of information about the strengths of the system but more particularly its weaknesses, of which there are many.  We have failed those with the greatest needs.  Information is not collected systematically on the number of children with literacy problems.  It came as a shock when the Education Research Centre recently discovered that one in five of 16 and 17 year olds was unable to make sense of the information carried on the back of an aspirin package.  The Minister should be willing to publish the findings of the inspectorate to allow an informed debate.  We have been starved of hard information for far too long.</P>
      <P>I commend the amendment to the Minister. The least we should expect from the inspectorate is that it would carve out a strong role for itself in the way that those who authored this section had in mind but it seems it will be far too dependent on the Minister through whom much of the information collected will be filtered before it will see the light of day.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 25, before &ldquo;to assess&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in consultation with parents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the assessment of the psychological needs of students in recognised schools and the provision of advice for parents about their psychological development.  What is remarkable is that it is not mentioned anywhere that parents have the right to be consulted.  It is important in assessing a child's psychological needs which will lead to strategies to assist the child that his or her parents are at the heart of the process.  If the amendment is not made, parents will find that they have been short-changed once again.  They must be seen as partners in the education system.  They are recognised by the Constitution as the primary educators of their children.</P>
      <P>The right to be consulted is restricted by amendment No. 91 in the name of the Minister. Under that amendment parents will be consulted only where practicable.  Parents will not have an automatic right to be consulted, rather it will be a matter for the would-be experts to decide whether they should be included.  That is the wrong approach and it could be argued that it is in breach of the spirit of the Constitution which recognises parents as the primary educators of their children.</P>
      <P>The Minister should withdraw his amendment and support the alternative which is much clearer. I cannot conceive of a situation where it would be necessary to provide for an exemption.  The Minister should think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and have the same reservations about amendment No. 91 in the name of the Minister.  If difficulties relating to students with special needs are to be resolved, parents must play a pivotal role.  If in the consultation process parents do not co-operate, other methods can be looked at.  Parents have <Col N="16" /> inalienable constitutional rights and it is therefore probably unconstitutional not to consult them when a process such as that outlined in this section is embarked upon.</P>
      <P>The Minister should withdraw his amendment and provide at least for an attempted consultation with parents in every instance.  If parents refuse to co-operate then the needs of the children must be addressed in a different way, probably with the involvement of the local health board.  However, not to have a system of mandatory consultation with parents is undemocratic, wrong and counterproductive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have presented the arguments for this amendment previously.  I have often stated my growing alarm at the number of cases of dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD which are being diagnosed quite late in children's school careers and often at the end of their primary education.  This is appalling.  The Department must focus on the identification and assessment of these children <Col N="17" /> and put in place individual plans to deal with their needs.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to describe children with dyslexia, for example, simply as having reading problems. These are very specific difficulties and require specialised attention.  I am a national teacher and I did some remedial teaching early in my career, but my training did not equip me to understand or identify conditions such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD or ADHD.  This amendment is necessary because we need to demonstrate to parents who have been through the trauma of having these conditions identified at a late stage in their children's careers that the Department will now focus on these conditions and that the trauma will be avoided for parents in the future.</P>
    <P>I recently tabled questions in the Dáil about the definitions of these conditions and I am concerned at the content of the Minister's answers. I am particularly concerned at the Department's definition of autism.  This condition was first identified in 1943 so we have not known about it for very long.  Until relatively recently not much was known within the education system about the other conditions.  My amendment seeks to have the functions of an inspector include to identify, assess and advise of needs and provide individual plans in relation to students with the conditions I have mentioned.  This is the least we can provide for these children.  In the present climate, it is necessary that the conditions be specifically mentioned in the Bill and that the inspectorate have a clearly defined role in relation to them.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  There is no doubt the conditions described by Deputy O'Shea have not received a great deal of attention in the past.  Our knowledge and understanding of them is developing and it is important that the inspectorate include a centre of excellence to identify how they can best be dealt with and help schools to develop plans for the education of children who have these conditions. Deputy O'Shea's amendment has much to recommend it.  The Minister may argue that the Bill's general provision, which states that an inspector may conduct assessments of the educational needs of students, embraces the needs identified here.  Nonetheless, in view of the general belief that there has been a lack of attention to these needs there is merit in singling out conditions such as those mentioned in the Bill.  The amendment complements what the Minister is seeking to do.  He may say this amendment is redundant.  However, the specific statement in the Bill that it is one of the duties of the inspectorate to deal with these conditions makes it impossible to avoid doing so.  If these conditions were included in a general category it is possible that they would be forgotten about as they have been in the past.  There is merit in what Deputy O'Shea is proposing and I support his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the points <Col N="18" /> made by the Deputies and these are issues with which I am very concerned.  However, the amendment is not appropriate.  Most of what is in the amendment is already covered by other sections of the Bill.  Section 13(3)(a)(II), provides for inspectors to conduct assessments of the educational needs of students.  This includes the conditions and categories outlined by Deputy O'Shea in his amendment.</P>
      <P>I clearly signalled during our discussions the last day in the House that I was interested in moving towards the statementing position in terms of individual school plans for children in the context of a Seanad amendment.  On that occasion I said that my aim would be to make provision for statementing and to review the situation within three years of the enactment of the Bill with a view to subsequent amendment.  In other words, we would include a general provision on Committee Stage in the Seanad to cover the individual needs of children.  We should see how it works initially rather than imposing an obligation that it must be done tomorrow or next week.  I could arrange for an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  That deals with the latter half of the amendment in terms of the individual plans for students with dyslexia and dyspraxia.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that it would be the function of an inspector to &ldquo;identify, assess and advise of needs and provide in individual plans .&rdquo;.  I have been aware of the lack of research into autism, for example, since I became Minister. There has been a lack of official recognition of autism in the educational world and in official policy for some time.  It is interesting that the CIRC review body did not categorise autism as a separate category which would require its own staffing and scheduling.  I acknowledge there is a deficit and I intend to put it right.  There is a significant lack of indigenous research into autism.  I have met the Irish Society for Autism which is made up of parents, many of whom have considerable experience.  I have noticed that different groups of parents have different attachments to different methodologies for dealing with autism. We tend to import many teaching methodologies for autism.  The predominant method in Ireland is the TEACCH method which we use in Beech-park. However, other parents have said that they believe in the Lovaas method.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to meet the various interests and to try to accommodate as best we possibly can the concerns and needs of parents.  It would not be fair to expect the inspector to identify all these needs.  As regards autism, for example, a child should ideally be diagnosed as being autistic before an inspector sees them because the earlier the diagnosis, the better the chances of intervening in a more positive way and helping that child with their subsequent quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need earlier diagnosis of and comprehensive research on autism.  It would be an unfair burden to expect inspectors to accommodate all the obligations in the amendment.  This goes back <Col N="19" /> to the pre-school situation.  Children with autism need early intervention and I am satisfied we will do something about that.  We set up a number of classes and a special school in September to try to give children with autism greater access.</P>
    <P>I am carrying out a comprehensive review of our treatment of children with dyspraxia and dyslexia, in particular, from the beginning through to examinations and the arrangements we put in place for many young students who are studying for the junior and leaving certificate.  I am not satisfied that we are giving them a fair crack of the whip.  It will take a lot of hard thinking and there might be significant shifts in our approach to the examination system to accommodate children with these conditions, but that is the road I want to travel while at the same time protecting the overall integrity of the examination system. Our philosophy should be to facilitate children to learn and to show off in examinations what they have learned rather than allowing the examination system to be an undue penalty on children with these conditions, which I suspect it is at present.  I am anxious to have a good debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for the inspector to cater for all the educational needs of children.  I am prepared to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad to deal with the issue of individual plans for children with special needs, which would be a radical departure.  I have said it will not be all-embracing initially but that we can include a provision to review it within three years. There are many issues pertaining to these conditions that extend beyond the role of the inspector. We cannot place all the obligations on the inspector to assess, identify and deal with the needs of children.  A more comprehensive approach is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question the Minister's good intentions in this area and I am sure he will deliver on what he has said.  However, I have come across cases where it was known that a child was failing at school, but it took someone outside the system to refer them to the health services for diagnosis.  That type of situation must be avoided at all costs.  When children are under-performing in school, the inspector should have a base line responsibility to see that the conditions listed in the amendment or similar ones are diagnosed as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of measures he is putting in place to improve the examination system.  Many parents have children who will face State examinations in the near future, yet they are not aware of what the Minister has told us. These parents must be told what is happening.  If they do not get information, they may feel abandoned or distressed and that can have a horrific effect on family life.  I accept the Minister is doing all he can but, as someone who is adroit at public relations, he should use all the methods available <Col N="20" /> to him to get this information across to the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly adroit at public relations but that is a matter for another debate.  Parents of children with dyslexia and other special needs who have gone through the examination system are painfully aware of its shortcomings.  I have outlined my personal view of how we should move forward.  It will be difficult, although possible, to change the way the examination system works and responds to young students with particular needs.</P>
      <P>The great argument against liberalising the situation too much is that it will damage the overall integrity of the examination and results.  I have initiated a review in the Department of the existing arrangements for students with special needs who are sitting examinations to see if we can be more responsive and sympathetic to their needs. The Bill covers the points raised in the amendment. It does not specify each condition but it deals with the issues in a comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The time lag between the application by the school and the decision to put special measures in place for special needs students who are taking State examinations is distressing for parents.  A decision can be reached at five minutes to midnight which is unacceptable. The system must be urgently improved so students and parents know at an early stage the special provisions which are being made.</P>
      <P>The section to which the Minister referred states that the inspector &ldquo;may&rdquo; conduct assessments of the educational needs of students. However, the percentage occurrence of these conditions among Irish children is considerably below the international average.  I am afraid there is a large number of children with these conditions in the education system who have not been identified.</P>
      <P>If progress is to be made, the buck must stop somewhere.  Inspectors should be made aware of children who are not functioning normally or obviously have a difficulty which cannot be identified in school.  Teachers are not trained in this area and it is a job for educational psychologists. A child with a difficulty should be brought to an educational psychologist as early as possible.  I will not make negative remarks about the present psychological service.  However, there should be some method of referral for children who do not have access to an educational psychologist.  Some areas have more than one whereas other have none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to urgently address this area.  I have seen parents anguished and distressed because of this problem.  As an Oireachtas, we cannot stand by and allow it develop.  In some areas diagnosis is provided in the private sector but I would be much happier if diagnosis in all cases was provided in the public sector.  It undermines parents' confidence in the educational system and the Department when <Col N="21" /> families who can ill afford it have to go outside the public sector to get a diagnosis especially when it was known for a long time that their children were underperforming or behaving in a dysfunctional manner.  It is appalling that if parents do not go outside the public system, their children can finish their schooling without any diagnosis being reached.  I have put down this amendment to change this.  There is a fundamental need to signal to support groups that the diagnosis of these conditions is a priority of the Department. I withdraw the amendment pending the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 94:</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;or expedient&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;or expedient&rdquo; from section 13(6) as it applies to the inspectorate.  The section states:</P>
      <P>An Inspector shall have all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the purpose of performing his or her functions and shall be accorded every reasonable facility and co-operation by the board and the staff of a school or centre for education.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is adequate to describe the powers an inspector should have.  It can mean that something must be done, or is required or is indispensable.  The word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; is more transient than the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  I suggest it means &ldquo;useful&rdquo;.  Something can be useful to an inspector but is not necessarily useful to the education system.  I am concerned that the use of the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; could lead to an inspector dealing with specific circumstances.  The word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is more important as there is a strong standing interpretation of the word as regards the way in which inspectors work.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; means desirable.  It could be desirable to the inspector to have particular powers but this does not necessarily mean it is in the interest of schools, students or teachers.  I do not see why it is necessary to include the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo;.  It has connotations of flying by the seat of one's pants and it is not appropriate in terms of the functions of inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; as used in this provision is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as &ldquo;advantageous, suitable to the circumstances of the case&rdquo;.  It is also a standard word used in legislation.  My legal advice is strong that it is a very appropriate word to use in relation to the powers of the inspector.  We should bear in mind we spent the past few hours debating the kind of powers we want to give the inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of defining what is suitable for schools and everybody else.  We are giving <Col N="22" /> serious functions to the inspectorate and are inserting a clause here to ensure the inspector will have the necessary and expedient powers for the conduct and performance of his or her functions. The use of the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; is not inappropriate, dangerous or undesirable.  This is not the first time it has been used in legislation.  It is a safe word and does not have connotations of flying by the seat of one's pants.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy O'Shea's concern on the grounds that this could be a compulsive power and the inspectorate could exercise rights which could affect peoples' human rights. &ldquo;Expedient&rdquo; would be a curious word to use in this context as it would imply that inspectors made up their own needs.  In the context of the inspectorate it is not offensive.  However, I will listen to Deputy O'Shea's summing up.</P>

The other question which arises is who will interpret what is expedient.  The legal advice concerns what the courts will ultimately say but an inspector may tell the Minister he has done the expedient thing, which may not be the correct thing in a given case.  However, I do not intend to pursue the matter.  I will withdraw the amendment and accept the Minister's legal advice.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 26, to delete &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These words are to be deleted from section 14(1), dealing with the establishment and membership of boards of management.  The provision currently reads: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of a patron, for the purposes of ensuring that a recognised school is managed in a spirit of partnership, to appoint where practicable a board of management&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage I strongly made the point that it is not acceptable that a school in receipt of <Col N="23" /> moneys from the Oireachtas should be allowed to operate without such a board.</P>
    <P>The concept of partnership underpins this legislation, which will bring the education system into the next millennium.  To allow schools to continue operating without a board of management which includes teachers' and parents' representatives, is utterly unacceptable.  We are in the EU and we hear buzzwords like subsidiarity, inclusiveness and empowerment, yet in the fundamental matter of the education of children, the Minister has not produced legislation which clearly provides that teachers and parents must be involved in the management of all primary and secondary schools.  This cannot be justified.  The Minister has made a move in this but it should be a fundamental principle that all schools must be run on a partnership basis.  This reneges on the republicanism underpinning the State.  We can make excuses that particular circumstances do not allow for this but it is repugnant that parents and teachers should not be involved in the management of schools.  Will the Minister remove these words which I, as a republican, find offensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 99 deals with some aspects of this matter.  The previous Bill placed an obligation on every school to have a board &mdash; where a school failed to appoint one, its subvention was frozen at its then level and it did not benefit from any increases which might otherwise accrue.  This provision was effectively the power to enforce the appointment of a board but that approach did not commend itself to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The phraseology in this Bill has something to commend it because in a legal sense &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; can be a narrow basis on which to escape responsibility &mdash; one could not argue that it was not practicable to appoint a board because one did not like the type of people who might be elected to it.  However, I would like to hear the Minister's legal advice as to what exceptions might be covered by the phrase.  About 180 out of 700 second level schools do not have boards. Perhaps the Minister could indicate why certain schools will be or are likely to be unwilling to appoint boards.</P>
      <P>The other aspect of the matter is that certain minority church schools have democratic systems which would not necessarily comply with the requirement that the composition of their boards should be agreed between patrons, national associations, recognised school management organisations, and recognised trade unions and staff associations.  Those schools have systems which they feel are operating well and with which the parents are happy but which would not fulfil the precise terms of the Bill.  I presume the phrase &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; is a vehicle through which they may continue to operate their existing boards and trustees, etc., while remaining within the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> On Committee Stage the Minister did not explain who was covered by this, what difficulties there might be in appointing a board, and which schools have legitimate difficulties and viable alternatives accepted by the State.  I can understand Deputy O'Shea's difficulties with the wording used because if the State is paying the costs, a democratic approach should be taken to running the school.  That does not mean we should impose the Marlborough Street version if the existing version is acceptable, nor that we should insist that every board structure should be mediated through a partnership at national level.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear more from the Minister in defence of the &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; reason and whether it is robust as a vehicle for allowing that degree of diversity in the system, which I believe is acceptable. Legitimate systems are in place for running minority schools that have been established over time and which are not a cause of offence to the parents.  I do not propose to kick those sleeping dogs although I understand the point Deputy O'Shea made.  The Minister should elaborate on what exactly is in place here.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that some minority schools believe their system is acceptable and do not want to come under this proposal.  My amendment would require patrons of these schools to report every year to the Minister that they are not in a position to appoint a board of the type the Minister has in mind, and to inform the parents of that.  Over time, therefore, pressure would be put on those schools to appoint boards that complied with a national norm.  If those schools were seen to be operating effectively and capable of protecting their interests there would be an obligation on them to report every year to the Minister on what they were doing.</P>
    <P>Based on the Minister's amendment, which is similar to my own, I am satisfied we have a vehicle that will evolve over time but the Minister must deal with the particular cases in the House. This section should not allow people to thumb their noses at parents or other partners in the system, with no forum whereby those interests are given expression in the running of the school.  In that respect I agree with Deputy O'Shea.  Some may say this is an Irish solution but our education system has evolved over a long time and we cannot immediately impose a particular version of orthodoxy.  However, the bedrock principles for the running of schools must be respected by anyone who seeks exemption under this practicality clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with almost everything Deputy Bruton said.  He has outlined my own views in changing this section from the original section in the first Bill.  I am trying to take compulsion out of the system because when people are compelled to do something, the results are never good.  Partnership is the key ingredient of this Bill and if we want genuine partnership in terms of persuading different types of schools to <Col N="25" /> form boards of management, we will achieve much more through consultation and consensus than compulsion.</P>
      <P>The sanction proposed in the first Bill that schools which failed to observe a centralist orthodoxy, in the sense that everybody must follow whatever Marlborough Street agreed with some national associations &mdash; the thread running through the first Bill &mdash; would lose funding was completely unacceptable.  If we impose mandatory obligations on schools it follows that there must be penalties if those obligations are not observed, and the only people who would lose out would be the students.  If a school is deprived of funding the quality of the education provision in that school will be diluted.  That is too heavy-handed and is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years a facilitator was appointed from the different denominational groups and bodies, management, unions and parents. Following a great deal of time and diplomacy, we arrived last November at a conclusion to those discussions and established boards of management in every primary school in the country in line with that agreement.  Indeed variations were signed by the respective partners without legislation, compulsion or threats from the State.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring in the Bill to replicate that at second level in terms of the management structures of schools.  Second level is even more complex than first level because, as Deputy Bruton said, there is considerable diversity in terms of school types and that position must be monitored as it evolves.  For example, as vocations drop in the schools that belong to religious orders we will see further change both in terms of trusteeship and boards of management.  Many of the orders have been proactive in democratising their management structures and establishing boards of management.  We would like some general principles to be accepted in terms of staff and trustee representation.  Comprehensive schools have not had proper representative boards of management for over 30 years, and I instructed my officials in July to begin negotiations with that sector with a view to establishing such boards of management.</P>
      <P>In their representations in respect of the Education (No. 1) Bill, the lay voluntary secondary schools, a relatively small but successful category, articulated real concerns about compulsion. However, I am anxious to persuade those schools of the merits of establishing representative boards to manage the schools.</P>
      <P>The Church of Ireland schools made cogent representations also in respect of the Education (No. 1) Bill.  They have a different structure of management and tend to appoint to their boards of management people in their community who have particular strengths in education, a system which is to be commended.  A representative model is fine up to a point but in many rural areas schools experience difficulties in getting parents onto the boards of management.  Some areas are not as well organised as others.  That is the background to the approach I am taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> The phrase &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; is a strong legal term and a guarantor that we are moving towards the establishment of boards of management in schools.  I intend to put forward an amendment arising out of the amendment Deputy Bruton put forward on Committee Stage concerning the responsibility on patrons unable to appoint a board of management on grounds of practicality, etc.  If a board is not so appointed the patron shall, from time to time, as requested by the Minister, inform the parents, teachers and other staff.  That is a further strengthening of the Bill in terms of narrowing the reasons boards of management are not appointed.  I am confident that once the Bill is passed we will rapidly see the establishment of boards of management throughout the country in all second level schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point in relation to compulsion, which seldom brings success, but the reality is that teachers will be compelled as a result of this legislation.  The optout clause remains for particular schools but the money provided by the Exchequer will come from the taxpayers.  Therefore, the principles desired by the majority should be adopted by those responsible for managing all second level schools.</P>
      <P>If a significant majority of people involved in a school do not want a board of management to be should they be allowed to have their way? Equally, if there is a significant minority of people who want a board of management, including representation from parents, when will the wishes or desires of these people be acted upon?</P>
      <P>The model where people with a particular expertise in education are included among the members of whatever board manages a school seems to have merit, but I will return to deal with that point later.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not explained the nature of the term &ldquo;acceptable defences&rdquo;.  I would not like schools to be allowed to deny parents or teachers a role in their operation. However, I can accept the use of reasonable alternatives which developed over the years and which have stood the test of time.  Who will be responsible for testing the issue of practicality?  If a school refuses point blank to give a role to parents or teachers, it is expected that someone will challenge such an action.  Is it envisaged that the Minister will do so or will parents be obliged to initiate some form of litigation under the legislation? What legal advice has the Minister received in respect of the term &ldquo;practicality&rdquo;? What sort of defences will succeed or fail in instances where boards prove to be intransigent by refusing to put in place a system which helps to manage a school in a spirit of partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not considered an entire scenario of cases where schools may state that they cannot put a board of management in place. It is our view that there will be few reasons to <Col N="27" /> demonstrate why it is not practicable to establish a board of management.  I envisage that my Department will be proactive in terms of initiating the process of the establishment of democratic boards of management which include sufficient representation of all interests.</P>
      <P>One key practical issue here involves constitutional difficulties.  It is clear that if we take the mandatory route, as was the case with the original Bill, a constitutional challenge would be forthcoming. I accept that it is open to argument because I am not a constitutional expert. However, where a lay voluntary school is established and owned by an individual who has a certain dynamic ethos and vision for it and parents &mdash; recognising the reasons for its establishment, its ethos, etc.  &mdash; decide to send their children there, an argument has been put forward that the State would infringe upon the constitutional rights of the individual who owns and operates the school by endeavouring to impose a certain form of management structure on them.  Others argue that this would not happen.  However, that view was put to me by owners of lay voluntary secondary schools when I was in Opposition at a time when a great deal of legal opinion on this matter was doing the rounds.  The mandatory route would create a significant difficulty for that small category of schools but I do not envisage any problems in respect of all other schools.</P>
      <P>The philosophy underpinning my approach to this issue is that we should take the route of consensus, consultation and discussion in order to obtain agreement among the partners.  If agreement is achieved in this manner, the boards will sustain themselves for a long period.  However, if we take the other route we will become entangled in rows, arguments and debate and a negative atmosphere will govern the situation.</P>

      <P>The word from which we should begin our deliberations is &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;.  I accept that democracy may not always be a perfect instrument, but our democracy requires that when we put structures in place we should take account of people's overall rights.  In the context of this matter there is an argument that we should consider the rights of minorities whether that means the teachers in a school, less than the full complement of the parents of children attending that school or a minority of those parents. However, this is a much wider issue.</P>
      <P>Democracy dictates that there must be a model of partnership for all schools and teachers.  One could call this an &ldquo;industrial democracy&rdquo; but I believe it goes deeper than that.  It is vital that, as we move into the next century, models are put in place which reflect an open, pluralist society.  We can discuss the rights of individuals under the Constitution but I would argue whether the Judiciary has the right to instruct the Executive with regard to how scarce resources should be allocated across the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to sanctions and penalties. <Col N="28" /> However, my amendment makes no reference to either and it merely seeks to remove the qualification of the phrase &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;. The Minister may state that this is a strong phrase in its way.  Perhaps he is correct but the legislation must state the principle which is that each school at first and second level should and must put in place a board of management that is based on partnership and the input of the elected representatives of teachers and parents.  There cannot be any democratic deviation from this principle.  If people wish to take a particular line on this matter then so be it.  The amendment makes no suggestions in respect of imposing sanctions, it merely suggests that the legislation should state the principle.  That would still provide the Minister with the room he requires to negotiate with the various interested groups to bring about the situation everyone desires, namely, that democratically elected boards of management should be put in place in all schools.</P>
    <P>We can discuss schools appointing people with a particular skill or expertise in education but as I understand it that concept is elitist.  Who is responsible for deciding if a person has a particular skill or expertise?  In the context of boards of management, patrons must also have the right to nominate people in addition to ensuring that parent and teacher interests are represented.</P>
    <P>As we approach the new century we cannot allow individual schools to opt out of appointing boards of management.  As Deputy Bruton stated, it appears there is something about which the Minister is not informing us in respect of situations where it would be acceptable to him that democratically elected boards of management would not be appointed in certain schools.  There seems to be a contradiction in terms of what he states as a matter of principle.  On the other hand he seems to suggest there are situations where it would be acceptable that democracy would not obtain in terms of the management of schools.  I am totally unconvinced.  This is a matter of fundamental principle and it is a bad day's work that we cannot agree to this amendment.  The amendment merely seeks to remove the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; and it does not mention sanctions. The Minister wants time and space to find an informal solution to this problem but in seeking it we are being asked to pass legislation which still gives a &ldquo;get out&rdquo; for particular schools or individuals who do not wish to have a democratic element of control in their management, in spite of the fact that taxpayers money is used in the management of those schools.</P>

I suggest the addition of the words &ldquo;following selection in accordance with procedures set out by the Minister in consultation with the education partners involved&rdquo;.

      <P>There are two amendments in my name being discussed together.  Section 14(4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The members of a board shall, except where articles of management otherwise provide, be appointed by the patron of the school.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 101 seeks to add the words &ldquo;in accordance with regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.  It could be argued that a set formula may not be appropriate in every case.  However, there must be an assurance that the partners in education are represented uniformly on education boards.</P>
    <P>In respect of section 14(5) my amendment No. 106 seeks to add the following &ldquo;and qualifications for appointment, including awareness of, and experience in assessing and providing, special education needs&rdquo;.  This has been fundamental to my approach to the Bill.  In the absence of a repository of experience in special needs on the board of management, the agenda for people with disabilities will not move forward as rapidly and as effectively as it might.  Expertise follows commitment. By and large those who have expertise in this area will be motivated to look after the needs of those with disabilities.  I am not seeking formal qualifications but rather an understanding and a working knowledge of people with disabilities. It may be said that it is being unnecessarily restrictive and that it may debar people from entry to boards of management who would have a great deal to offer in other ways.</P>
    <P>In the composition of boards of management if the Government is not prepared to ensure, against a background of a strong lobby group, the mainstreaming of people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, and move away from the special school system that has served people with disabilities admirably up to now, many people will choose to send their children to special schools.  That expertise is in the special schools.  If we are seeking to break new ground in the provision for pupils with special needs, it is imperative a prerequisite should be the appointment of board members with basic knowledge and expertise in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 100 and Deputy O'Shea's amendment No. 101 which relate to the procedures for the selection of members of boards, I do not consider them necessary as the matters covered by them are covered in subsection 5.  My amendment 105 provides that the Minister shall prescribe matters relating to the appointment of the board.  The Bill, as originally drafted, provides that the Minister may make such regulations. Amendment 105 strengthens that by providing that the Minister shall make such regulations. Subsection 5 deals with the Minister having powers to prescribe matters relating to the establishment and the making of regulations relating to the appointment of boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree there should be a statutory requirement for board members to have particular experience of special needs as required under amendment No. 106.  Some board members may have such experience, but in regard to this area a <Col N="31" /> board would have to be assisted by the education support centres or by way of access to expertise in the area of special needs.  One would expect a board would have a policy on special needs in the school and that experts in the field would be consulted by a board in that respect.  This amendment is unnecessarily restrictive in that some boards have only two parents and two teachers and they may find it difficult to select members that meet this requirement.  Later amendments propose gender should be taken into account in the formation of boards.  If we were to do all that, it could be difficult to establish boards, particularly the representative boards we are anxious to establish as in the primary school model.  If this obligation were imposed in regard to the school boards of one or two teacher schools in rural Ireland, there is no guarantee we would find someone who would meet this requirement.  The amendment, as phrased, does not fit in appropriately in line 50 after the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is meant by the words &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; and &ldquo;experience&rdquo; and how does one assess that? The procedure is that parents convene a meeting for the purposes of electing parents to the board of management.  How would the general body of parents assess who has the relevant experience or qualifications?  They must vote on two representatives to be appointed to the board.  I accept the motivation behind the Deputy's amendment is to continue to create an awareness of special needs at every level of the system, but there would be many logistical difficulties in including such a provision. This requirement should be an integral part of the school plan and the relevant expertise appertaining to that area should be solicited by the board.  That is the way we should proceed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment which substitutes the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not mention the matters he intends to prescribe.  My amendment provides that, at a minimum, the Minister should prescribe selection procedures having consulted the partners.</P>
    </Speaker>

It does not specify that the selection procedure would be democratic, which is the point we are making.  I have no doubt the Minister will prescribe in a reasonable way and I do not propose to press my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the intent of Deputy O'Shea's amendment, but he may be over-prescribing in respect of the test a member or all members of a board may have to pass.  It is too much to expect every member of a board to have an awareness of and experience in assessing and providing special education needs.  As the Minister said, the school plan and other elements of the Bill should be designed to ensure that special education needs are to the fore.  I share Deputy O'Shea's sentiment <Col N="32" /> that in some ways the Bill has failed to do that, but this may not be the best vehicle to make up for lost ground in other sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw my amendment No. 101 on the basis of the Minister's amendment. I accept there are difficulties in accepting amendment No. 106, but if we do not seek to include a provision such as this a board could be appointed whose members may not have any interest, knowledge or expertise in the area of special needs.  That would not be progressive in catering for pupils with special needs when additional resources will be allocated to that sector in the future.  I tabled this amendment to seek to avoid the establishment of a board whose members would not have any empathy with disability. I am not criticising members of school boards, but those dealing with the area of special needs must have a basic understanding of that area.  Some people may not have any knowledge or awareness of the requirements of people with special needs.  If one board was established whose members did not have such an understanding, it is one too many.  I will not press my amendment, but between now and passage of the Bill through the Seanad will the Minister consider a mechanism which would ensure members of a board of management at first and second level would have some element of understanding and empathy with disability?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 102:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) In making appointments to the board the patron and other partners involved in nominating members to the board shall, as far as is practicable, ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined by the Minister from time to time among the membership thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage. The Minister considered the requirement that membership of a board made up of 40 per cent of each gender was too rigid an approach.  He favoured a more gradualist approach.  However, he has failed to introduce a Report Stage amendment to ensure gender balance on boards.  My amendment is worded to secure a reasonable gender balance, that a substantial number of both sexes would be appointed to boards.  The amendment provides that in making appointments to the board, the patron and other partners involved in nominating members shall, as far as practicable, <Col N="33" /> ensure an appropriate gender balance is determined by the Minister from time to time among the membership thereof.  From the parent's point of view there should undoubtedly be one male and one female member of the board. From a teacher's point of view, if it is not an all single sex teaching staff an effort should be made to have one member of each sex on the board. Similarly, from the point of view of the trustees one of each sex should be appointed.</P>
    <P>There may be an argument for providing exceptions in the case of single sex religious orders.  However, in failing to prescribe anything in this area the Minister is short changing.  There is no problem with parents deciding that a mother and father will be their representatives on the board and in running elections on such a basis. We run such elections in the Seanad with the various inside and outside panels.  I am not aware if the Minister had the good fortune to contest one such panel, but compiling panels that are reasonably balanced both from inside and outside does not bewilder the electorate.  There should be a legislative procedure here to provide for such balance.</P>
    <P>While it cannot apply to single sex panels, such exceptions would be admitted under the formulation provided in the amendment.  It addresses the difficulties arising from the previous formulation of 40 per cent, which was discussed on Committee Stage, and which might be too tight a procedure to allow a Minister make amendments based on the way a school is run.  This amendment is robust in that it can allow the Minister prescribe that both genders be represented in the case of parents, of teaching panels in mixed teacher schools and so on.  That is a reasonable way to proceed.</P>
    <P>To fail to make any legislative measure of this kind turns the clock back on ground won in recent years.  In Government sanctioned appointments to boards there has been a clear policy to increase women's representation to a target of 40 per cent.  The Minister should reflect that desire in this legislation and use the mechanism provided in this amendment.  I hope it is commendable to him.  On Committee Stage I recall he was sympathetic to the idea.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach is foolish. If he cannot see the wisdom of having both genders represented on the various boards involved he has missed a dramatic trend in society.  He is not looking beyond the end of his nose if he hopes single sex boards will reflect a balance of the types of pressures and demands in the education system today.  This is not a symbolic measure to genuflect to a lobby that wants balance. It is important in ensuring there is a genuine balance in the approach to education issues.  Anybody with an appreciation of developments in education will see the wisdom of that.  The Minister <Col N="34" /> should think again.  I thought he was somewhat sympathetic to the issue and I am amazed that he rejects the idea of gender balance on school boards.  It is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has cogently presented a number of points I intended to make. A superficial glance at amendment No. 102 in my name could give the impression that it is prescriptive. However, management boards at first and second level are a focus for parental representation. Deputy Bruton referred to profound changes in the social order.  Too many children &mdash; it is an increasing number &mdash; are growing up without a male role model in their lives.  This is unhealthy.</P>
      <P>This issue should not be seen solely in a feminist context.  Difficulties may arise with male representation on the boards of single sex schools. Given the balance between the sexes on parenting and the role of parents, there should also be a balance in the context of the boards of management. I know of people who were single when they were appointed to boards of management and served admirably on them, so I have no problems in that area.  However, in single sex schools, be they boys or girls schools, the opposite gender should have at least 40 per cent representation on the board of management.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister appears to be refusing to consider taking any action to provide for some gender quota in the context of boards of management.  In the recent by-election his party selected a woman candidate.  I am sure he had an input into that.  Although her campaign was not successful does it not indicate that the Minister has some sympathies in the direction of feminism? His involvement may be greater than I suggest, but it is not for me to comment further on that.</P>
      <P>If the Minister fails to ensure an adequate level of representation for both genders on management boards it is a step backwards.  My recollection is that both a male and a female parent had to be elected by the parents to management boards at primary level.  We should not divide the House on this issue, nor on the fundamental issue of gender participation at all levels of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with gender equity generally throughout the system and my appointments reflect that.  However, we are here concerned with more than 3,500 schools around the country.  We must be simple and practical.  I have not come across too many male nuns since my involvement in education.  If a national school is organised by a religious order of nuns and has a completely female teaching staff how do we ensure that 40 per cent of the board of management is male, especially when we take into account that trustees, teachers and parents have the right to nominate two members to the board? How do we get the 40 per cent gender balance, if that is what we put into the Bill?  I am not running away from anything, but I have looked at this <Col N="35" /> matter in detail and the logistics are quite baffling. We should be a little careful.  There is evidence that we have some way yet to travel in terms of getting boards established, particularly in many rural areas where the population is not large.</P>
      <P>The key priority should be to get people who are anxious and enthusiastic to serve on boards to put themselves forward.  We do not have a problem with women going on to boards of management; there are plenty of women available to serve on such boards.  As in social developments which have been reflected in other reports, men are not always as forthcoming as women in becoming involved in areas like this.  The last thing I want for a primary school board of management is someone literally running around the parish, making phone calls to ask someone to join the board of management because they need a man, just for the sake of it.  I am against that approach and that is why I will not accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>Because of the way education here has evolved we have single sex schools.  If one has an all female or all male teaching staff I do not know where we will find a male or female teacher to make up the 40 per cent gender balance.  We have about 700 to 800 two-teacher primary schools with a relatively small catchment of parents. Unfortunately, not everybody wants to serve on a school board of management.  I can see some potential for getting one male and one female parent, but there are real problems with staff and, obviously, there will be real problems where religious orders are trustees of or are managing schools.  These are practical difficulties.  We can all make general political statements about feminism but I am dealing with the practicalities of implementing this section and establishing boards of management.</P>
      <P>We know, for example, that far more women teach at primary level.  That in itself, would create difficulties with the 40 per cent gender balance requirement.  The real issue at primary level would be how many men can be found to serve on the board of management.  It is actually the reverse of the norm throughout other sections and strata in society.</P>
      <P>Given that we are in the first year and at the first stage of the new boards of management at primary level &mdash; even though before that, sporadically throughout the country, schools had boards of management &mdash; let us see how things emerge.  We could do some useful research in the area to see how things are panning out in terms of gender balance.  It would be very interesting and I am committed to doing that kind of research.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments as they stand would be practical, particularly those relating to the 40 per cent. I accept that Deputy Bruton's amendment is not as prescriptive in terms of how many, but there are very practical issues at stake here.  My main <Col N="36" /> commitment is to try and get boards of management established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by the Minister. My memory has not failed me that much.  I recall that on Committee Stage the Minister said that &ldquo;one could put in an overall provision for gender balance, but I am reluctant to go along the lines of the amendments which seek to insert exact quotas&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I am prepared to look at this on Report Stage.  I am against being too prescriptive because of the variety of school types.  I am prepared to look at amendments which read &lsquo;where practical, should have appropriate gender balance&rsquo;.&rdquo; The Minister was asked on Committee Stage whether concern had been expressed to him about the previous provisions and he indicated that only the management bodies had expressed concern.  He indicated that he would look at the deeds of variation to refresh his memory, having been reminded by Deputy O'Shea that the previous provisions had required the parents' representatives to be a man and a woman.  That was the existing provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone off on a bender of his own, contrary to the views of the partners, it would seem.  He has his own views about this matter, which are very backward looking.  We should be encouraging and providing vehicles that require gender balance to emerge.  In the past, the tradition was that males served on State boards. Umpteen reasons were always produced why they could not find an appropriate female, but it was just because they did not bother to look. There are plenty of eminently qualified men and women to serve on school boards around the country.  We are not confined to beating the bushes for some token man, as the Minister said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that.  There is a more fundamental question about what is becoming a predominantly female profession.  The figures for women in the teaching profession are as high as 85 per cent.  If children see boards of management that are predominantly female, the subliminal message may not be a particularly good one in terms of changing young male attitudes towards pursuing a teaching career.  If it means that schools have to seek men or women to obtain a gender balance on their boards then so be it.  People will not act on a board unless they give a commitment to do <Col N="37" /> so for the term of office of that board.  There is nothing wrong with seeking to recruit people who are willing to go forward.  In the parents' situation that is taken as read.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he had not met any male nuns and neither have I. When patrons are seeking their nominees, I have known nuns to successfully seek men for boards and I do not see anything wrong with that.  I am taken aback that the Minister is not prepared to take this matter on board.  He talks about practical difficulties but if something is the right thing to do, one should do it.</P>

Equally, we can say that trustees should have a balance in these sort of appointments. Both genders can bring experience and value to the successful managing of a board.</P>
      <P>I accepted on Committee Stage that the Minister had problems with the flexibility of what we were putting forward.  That is why I tabled an amendment along the lines that he indicated would be acceptable to him.  We now find, however, that he has gone backwards.  That is inexplicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That means where there is a mixed teaching staff there will be one male and one female, in the case of parents there will always be one male and one female, and there will be an expectation that the trustees will be one male and one female.  The regulations which are determined by the Minister could recognise that there could be some exceptions in the case of, say, an order that wanted to have two of its members on the board and for particular reasons they were all of one sex.  That is why I did not repeat the 40 per cent rule.  However, in case of mixed teaching staffs there should be one male and one female and in the case of parents there should undoubtedly be one male and one female.</P>
      <P>It is good for a school that has always had two female or two male board members offering, to have to look to see if it can find someone of the opposite sex who is suitable to bring a new perspective to the board.  That is good and healthy.  Parents are much more interested in the way their school is run than the Minister gives them credit for.  If he puts in this legislative provision, people will accept it.  It would be like the Seanad system where there is one person inside and one outside and votes are taken on that basis.  We have done it at political conventions up and down the country where those requirements are imposed on us in the selection of candidates.  Everyone understands how it is done.  It will not be a foreign idea to parents electing their members.  The Minister should revert to the position he took on Committee Stage, which was a reasonable one.  We could understand where he was coming from then.  It is inexplicable where he is coming from now.</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo; is inadequate in terms of the liability of members of boards of management. Even though it is highly unlikely that this section will come into play, the phrase &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo; is inadequate in terms of the liabilities of members of boards of management.  Most people agree there is a compensation culture.  Those who serve on boards of management should therefore take reasonable care in discharging their duties and assess the full implications of proposed initiatives.  On Committee Stage the Minister said it was hard enough to get people to serve without introducing additional restrictions but boards of management have important responsibilities and to an extent act <i>in loco parentis.</i> Those who serve on them should therefore take the same level of care as parents in discharging their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that members of <Col N="41" /> boards of management are indemnified against potential actions.

      <P>In page 18, lines 5 to 7, to delete &ldquo;to manage the school on behalf of the patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section lays out the functions of boards of management.  I have a problem with the layout of section 15(1) which states &ldquo;It shall be the duty of a board to manage the school on behalf of the patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents and to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student at the school for which that board has responsibility&rdquo;. The second part of the subsection is most relevant.  The initial part is draconian.  It is understood and does not have to be restated that it is the duty of a board to manage the school on behalf of the patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents.  Its main duty is to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student.  The words that I wish to delete are superfluous.  It seems to be suggested that the duty of a board to the patron should take precedence over its duty to students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's argument. The section strikes a reasonable balance, which is desirable, between the rights of school owners, parents, students, teachers and the community. At first and second level we have in the main, privately owned but State funded schools. The added strength comes from co-operation.  We <Col N="42" /> have consulted all the partners in education on this section which is necessary for legal and constitutional reasons.  The balance would be disturbed if we were to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>It is not suggested that one phrase takes precedence over another.  The duty to manage a school on behalf of the patron does not take precedence over the duty to provide an appropriate education for each student.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to revise the content or allocation of current ministerial areas of responsibility. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has responsibility for European matters and I have no plans to appoint either a Minister or a Minister of State with responsibilities in this area.  With regard to attendance at meetings of the General Affairs Council, I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the last GAC meeting which was held on 26 and 27 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this question in support of the Government and of the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, with regard to the Northern Ireland process.  However, of the 14 meetings which the Minister for Foreign Affairs could have attended, two were trade related and were attended by Deputy Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and of the rest, the Minister attended only seven.  Three other Ministers of State, Deputies Ó Cuív, O'Donnell and Cullen have attended meetings.  I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a very important role <i>vis a vis</i> Northern Ireland but having regard to the importance of the European <Col N="43" /> dimension, whether in respect of regionalisation or other matters, does the Taoiseach not agree that our European interests are not being properly served by this intermittent and changing representation at the General Affairs Council?  We have all had experience of various European General Affairs Council meetings and we know that unless there is continuity of personnel our interventions will be made without the required authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit in which the Deputy has asked this question.  There were difficulties in the early months because between September of last year and April of this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs went to Northern Ireland regularly on Monday evening and normally returned on Thursday evening or Friday.  Since then the Minister has been able to attend the General Affairs Council and of the ten meetings of the Council held since the early part of this year the Minister has attended all but two or three.  On two of those occasions Deputy Kitt attended because the agenda was trade related and on one occasion the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív deputised for the Minister. I know it is the Minister's intention to attend at all times possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the choice of going to Canada to accompany the President or attending a meeting of the General Affairs Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs chose to go to Canada. Having regard to the practice of the previous administration where there was, in the Department of the Taoiseach, a person with responsibility for European affairs, does the Taoiseach agree that we are in danger of losing out because of the overload of responsibilities carried by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and because the Government coalition arrangements oblige the Minister of State to be in Belfast rather than in Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If a difficulty arises I will appoint a co-ordinating Minister but no such difficulty has arisen.  Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, attended a General Affairs Council meeting when Agenda 2000 was being discussed, having been briefed by the Department of Finance. Deputy Kitt has also attended.  The only other representative to attend meetings of the council is Deputy Ó Cuív, Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  In no case was Ireland's interest not attended to.  Deputy Quinn is aware that the agenda of the General Affairs Council tends to revolve around arguments on how internal and external matters should be dealt with.  This matter was discussed recently in Austria.  I have spoken to the Minister, to the Minister of State and to <Col N="44" /> officials of the Department about this matter and I can assure the Deputy there is no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to press this point because I have Ireland's interest at heart as has the Taoiseach.  However, I have not yet referred to the two meetings at which a Minister was not present but which were attended by the permanent representative.  Ministers were in place but they were so politically preoccupied that they were somewhere else.  I refer the Taoiseach to his reply to Question No. 137 of 6 October last.  The situation is not satisfactory.  We will return to this matter and I am giving him fair notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has brought up the question, I might mention the previous record of people missing meetings but I do not propose going into that matter.  Ministers should attend meetings whenever possible.  In fairness to the Minister, on a number of occasions when he was obliged to choose between attending the General Affairs Council and staying in Northern Ireland I dictated that he remain in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the problem has two sides to it.  One is the burden of responsibilities on the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has a wide-ranging brief and the other is the burden of the agenda of the General Affairs Council which is also very wide.  The solution being mooted by the General Affairs Council is the splitting of responsibilities between Ministers for Foreign Affairs and deputy prime ministers.  What is the Taoiseach's attitude to that?  Would he agree to appoint the Tánaiste, for example, as Deputy Prime Minister to take up the internal agendas which are extremely important for this country and for all members of the European Union so that we have a Minister at every meeting where issues of concern to the people are dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Austrian Presidency was requested in Cardiff to look at the possibility of trying to manage the agenda of the General Affairs Council, which is now taking two and sometimes three days to complete.  It has probably had more than a dozen formal meetings and several weekend get togethers in the first eight or nine months of this year.  The demands on Foreign Affairs Ministers throughout Europe are great.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was suggested that they would regulate their agendas both on internal and external issues and either have them one day after the other or split them altogether.  I supported <Col N="45" /> the idea of splitting them and having them at separate times of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When Mr. Victor Klima, the Austrian Chancellor, asked me to consider the idea of different Ministers or deputy leaders, I said I would accept that suggestion.  Unfortunately, because of the arrangements throughout Europe and the different combinations of coalitions, there was not much support for that idea. The proposal at the Austrian informal meeting, that one meeting would take place on two separate days and countries could decide who they wanted to send, is still not finalised.  Foreign Affairs Ministers and Prime Ministers were not prepared to separate the meetings totally.  From 1999 onwards the General Affairs Council will be a two day, internal and external, meeting.  Foreign Affairs Ministers will be obliged to attend both if they can do so, although they may separate them if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely resistance to the idea of splitting responsibilities came primarily from Foreign Affairs Ministers who were concerned about the loss of status and weight within the European decision-making processes?  It would be of value to this country if a deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs represented the interests of this country at General Affairs Council meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with that.  The Deputy is right that Foreign Affairs Ministers throughout Europe did not like the idea.  This was well reported in the international press if not the Irish press.  The President of the General Affairs Council attended the informal meeting for the first time in a long time to put their case, which showed that Foreign Affairs Ministers were using their influence.  We were prepared to have deputy leaders, which I thought was sensible because the agenda is wide, or Foreign Affairs Ministers.</P>
      <P>The meetings take place almost on a fortnightly basis and are heading more in that direction, as Deputy Quinn said.  It is difficult for any Minister to give two days a fortnight to meetings.  Up until now, ECOFIN Ministers were probably the busiest as they attended meetings one day in every three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the suggestion made by Deputy Quinn for the appointment of a Minister for European Affairs, does the Taoiseach recall that when coming into Government <Col N="46" /> he acknowledged there was a problem in his proposal to appoint the then Minister for Defence as Minister for European Affairs and that it was only when it was discovered that this was not legal that the proposal had to be abandoned? Does that not show that the Taoiseach, even on his appointment, recognised there was a problem which has still not been resolved today and that the most appropriate course for him to adopt might be the approach adopted not just in the Government I led, but in the Government in which he participated previous to that where there was a Minister for European Affairs in the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>As I recall, it was not just a legality but the fact that a Minister would be subordinate to another Minister in certain circumstances, which could have created difficulties, that led me to abandon the idea.  However, that Minister will continue to stand in whenever necessary. I was endeavouring to have two well briefed Ministers involved.  We take great care in deciding who goes to these meetings and what issues are on the agenda.  It is better if the Minister attends these meetings and, if not, the Minister of State.  If it had not been for the intensity of the talks in Northern Ireland, which we hope will not go back to that stage again, where both Ministers were required three days a week, there would not have been a difficulty.  If there is, I will be the first to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have continued to meet and engage intensively in recent weeks with the parties and others on Northern Ireland, including a number of meetings in the past ten days.  I will continue to do so as appropriate in the days and weeks ahead.</P>
      <P>As I forecast last week, the deadline of 31 October has not been met.  It would have been desirable to have been able to respect this target date.  However, a great deal of work has been done.  Extensive preparatory work has been done by the Government.  Discussions have taken place between the Northern parties, including at last Thursday's round table meeting.  Valuable technical work has also been done by Departments in Northern Ireland and, in addition, there have been exploratory contacts between officials on both sides.</P>
      <P>As I said recently in my address to the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council, what we all need to do now is to build on the substantial work that has been done and to discharge the substance provided for in the Agreement.  The informal round table discussions which are now under way will facilitate progress.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the opportunity on Monday, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, to meet most of the Northern Ireland parties in round table format and later in bilaterals to advance the implementation of the Agreement's provisions on North South co-operation. Our discussions were constructive in tone and involved a real engagement in the detail of this key area.  I look forward to continued and early progress in our discussions.  The horrific murder of Mr. Brian Service on Saturday is a chilling reminder of the alternative to continued progress in turning the promise of the Agreement into a reality.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to report in detail on each meeting or telephone conversation which I have had.  However, recent meetings have focused on progressing the implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the issue of decommissioning, I have continued to emphasise that decommissioning is part of the Agreement and that all parties have affirmed their commitment to the total disarmament of paramilitary organisations. All those involved in the process must work constructively and in good faith with the Independent Commission and use any influence they may have to achieve decommissioning of paramilitary arms within two years.  I am aware that useful contact is continuing between the Independent <Col N="49" /> Commission and the parties on the practical dimensions of decommissioning but, as the House will be aware, this issue will be resolved in a political context and it is therefore important that we make progress in implementing the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards Nobel Peace Prize winners, Mr. John Hume and Mr. David Trimble, as I mentioned in response to previous questions, I welcome this award which will constitute a strong encouragement to ensure that the promise of the Agreement is fulfilled.  I have written to both to congratulate them.  I do not propose to take any further action in advance of the official award ceremony which I understand will take place in Oslo in early December.</P>
    <P>I had two main purposes for visiting Scotland on Thursday, 29 October.  The first was to deliver the Lothian European lecture at the invitation of the Scottish Secretary of State and the second was to mark the inauguration of the Consulate General of Ireland in Scotland.  The Secretary of State and I had a useful exchange of views on future relations between Ireland and Scotland within the ambit of the new British-Irish Council.</P>
    <P>The Lothian European lectures were launched in 1992 as part of the national programme of events celebrating the UK's presidency of the European Union.  My speech, which I have laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, dealt with the cultural heritage shared by Scotland and Ireland and also the implications of the establishment of the British-Irish Council arising from the Agreement.  I indicated that I looked forward greatly to the intensification of relations between the Irish Government and the devolved Scottish Government.</P>
    <P>My Department was heavily involved in the process of negotiation leading to the Agreement. The Department was also responsible for the preparation of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, which was required to give effect to the Agreement.  In addition, my Department has been playing a major role in the extensive programme of work being undertaken under the aegis of the interdepartmental steering group, which is co-ordinating implementation of all aspects of the Agreement and which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We learned from newspaper reports that the Sinn Féin leadership has informed the Taoiseach it is unable to convince the IRA leadership to proceed with any further developments as regards decommissioning in any shape, size or form.  Can <Col N="50" /> the Taoiseach confirm if these reports are accurate? If they are, has he confronted the leadership with the observation he has repeatedly made here, namely, that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two sides of the same coin?  Are they in effect telling the Taoiseach they cannot convince themselves to initiate a process of decommissioning?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is right that I have repeatedly conveyed my observations to the Sinn Féin leadership and it is well aware of my views.  It was requested at the beginning of September when it was not included in the Agreement, that a senior Sinn Féin official be included in the liaison group of the International Commission on Decommissioning to work constructively and productively with General de Chastelain. Sinn Féin announced that its chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, would be its representative. My information from Sinn Féin and the international commission is that constructive involvement is going ahead and several meetings have taken place.</P>
      <P>In terms of what must happen, a well publicised statement was made last week by Martin McGuinness saying Sinn Féin was co-operating and he reiterated its commitment to comply with the British-Irish Agreement.  He also said Sinn Féin would do all it could within the period of the Agreement to deal with the issue of decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach confirming the accuracy of the newspaper reports that Sinn Féin told him it cannot convince the army council of the IRA to initiate any process of decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what Sinn Féin has said to me, which I have just done.  It is clear to any observer, as everyone in this House is, that we are unlikely to see any move on decommissioning in the immediate future.  That is not to say Sinn Féin is not complying with the terms of the Agreement and what it promised at the beginning of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Taoiseach's views on the resumption of punishment shootings by paramilitaries and the implications this has for the decommissioning of the weapons being used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with punishment beatings, I must mention that which was more than a punishment, the assassination of Mr. Service last Saturday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach means murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, murder by assassination.  I condemn that brutal and callous murder and any punishment beatings conducted by any quarter in any community.  Punishment beatings have declined dramatically as the year has moved on. As soon as there is any delay in the political process <Col N="51" /> punishment beatings tend to occur.  This has been the experience for many years and we must avoid it, as I emphasised to all the political parties this week and last week.  Political leadership is required to move matters on so as not to stagnate, which is when difficulties occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree punishment beatings and shootings are intended to maintain a form of political intimidation in certain areas to the benefit of certain organisations? If those organisations also have stockpiles of arms the practice of punishment beatings creates an added focus on the threat posed by the arms.  If the punishment beatings and shootings were to stop completely the arms issue would become less difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Arms are a major problem in Northern Ireland and everywhere and if they were not there it would be a help.  However, as the Deputy knows, punishment beatings have little to do with arms, other than the murder of Mr. Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What effect does the Taoiseach think failure to establish the shadow executive by last Saturday had on the Agreement?  Is it intended that the shadow executive and the North-South bodies will come into effect at the same time in advance of the end of February? Will the Taoiseach indicate the reasons conveyed to the Irish Government by Sinn Féin, on behalf of the IRA, for not decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unhelpful if any provision in the Agreement is not strictly adhered to.  It is unhelpful when people want pre-conditions.  It is unhelpful when people try to justify pre-conditions which do not exist.  As I said a number of weeks ago when I predicted 31 October would come and go, there are certain realities and people can do only what they believe is politically viable.</P>
      <P>There is not a great deal to be gained, other than people stating their positions which they have done fairly well.  People on one side will say we should have moved on while others will say there were no pre-conditions.  The fact is there were no pre-conditions and the shadow executive and the North-South ministerial body should have been established some time ago as part of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has had a destabilising effect on the Nationalist community which has been conveyed to me by all Nationalist leaders.  Faced with that I, and those involved in the talks last week, whatever they can say inside or outside of them, believe the round table process is not a bad alternative. The establishment of the shadow executive and the North-South ministerial body was intended to achieve two aims, to agree ministerial portfolios, numbers and titles and to make the necessary arrangements with the Northern <Col N="52" /> Ireland Office to establish the new structures. That can be dealt with adequately in the round table talks and through the work of Mr. Trimble, Mr. Mallon and others.  I hope it will happen although I cannot be certain.</P>
    <P>The shadow executive and the North-South ministerial body are meant to agree the implementation bodies and the North-South bodies.  In the bilateral discussions we narrowed the differences. That is more difficult but I hope we can deal with it in the next few weeks.  The importance of doing both those things is that we will have done all the analytical, legislative and other preparatory work which is required before February, when the Agreement goes &ldquo;live&rdquo;&mdash; that is the word people in Northern Ireland like to use &mdash; and all the institutional arrangements are in place.  While it is unhelpful that this block occurred, there is an alternative way and we can keep things moving without losing too much time if we get agreement on those two matters &mdash; first, the Executive, the titles and the ministerial positions under the d'Hondt system, and second, the North-South bodies.  I think both of those are possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another aspect to the question which the Taoiseach did not address &mdash; that is, the reasons conveyed by Sinn Féin on behalf of the IRA for making neither a gesture nor a statement of willingness to decommission, given that to a significant extent most of the demands the republican movement has made about policing, prisoners, equality and all the other issues on its agenda are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy De Rossa knows I have made all those points myself, so rather than give my views I will say what Sinn Féin has said, which is what the Deputy asked.  Sinn Féin considers it has moved even further than the Agreement requires it to do &mdash; it was not asked under the Agreement to have its chief negotiator deal with General de Chastelain.  It believes it has honoured the commitment to work with the International Commission on Decommissioning under the Agreement to ensure decommissioning happens well within the two year period.  That is the party's position and I hope it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two statements from the IRA which clearly state there will be no decommissioning.  I am trying to discover whether Sinn Féin is conveying a different message on behalf of the IRA to the British and Irish Governments, and whether it still speaks authoritatively on this matter as it did, or at least as it claimed to do, when it was involved in the negotiations in the first instance, when it said decommissioning would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Agreement Sinn Féin is committed to doing all in its power to ensure that all paramilitary weapons over which <Col N="53" /> it has influence will be put out of circulation by the end of the two year period of the Agreement. I hope they will be able successfully to use that influence but unfortunately I do not know when, where or how.  I take some satisfaction from the fact that a senior member of Sinn Féin, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MP, the party's trusted chief negotiator, is the person dealing with General de Chastelain.  I would have been delighted if there had been decommissioning a long time ago, and in that regard I am talking not only about Sinn Féin but the PUP, which takes the same position on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Does the Taoiseach agree that the appalling sectarian murder or Mr. Service shows that there still are mindless sectarian killers on the fringes of political life in the North, outside the parties in the process, who are a threat not only to lives but to the peace?  Does he also agree that the squabbling among established politicians, based in different sections of the divide, does not assist in overcoming a climate of tension?  Against that background, will he urge the coming together of Protestant and Catholic working class communities, at trade union and community level, in an active effort to solve their common problems to overcome political and sectarian divisiveness?</P>
      <P>With regard to my Question No. 10, in the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Prime Minister did he raise the detention of the former Chilean dictator, General Pinochet?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Today's questions are to the Taoiseach, who discussed many issues other than Northern Ireland.  It is within that context that I believe I am entirely in order to raise other matters which he discussed.  The Taoiseach does not seem to have any difficulty with it.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I put down a specific question, in such a way as to encompass all the matters the Taoiseach would have discussed with the British Prime Minister.  I do not want to be argumentative, but on behalf of the people the Taoiseach has discussed many issues with Mr. Blair.  Did he commend the arrest and urge that the butcher of the Chilean people should be put on trial or extradited to Spain, and did he say he thought that would be the view of the majority of the Irish people, given the terrible crimes committed by that dictator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Working class people across the divide have been well represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  During all the years of murder and mayhem in Northern Ireland, ICTU was the one organisations which represented all individuals, regardless of what district they came from or where they worked.  Politicians, trade union leaders and business leaders are all trying to bring about agreement.  The Deputy is right to say that there still are terrible people at work, such as those who organised the Omagh carnage, those who killed Mr. Service, who were probably also involved in other attacks last week.  It is hard to know precisely who they are but they have broken away from paramilitary groups who were previously involved in these atrocities.  As long as those people are there, we have a difficulty, and the only way to overcome that is to move on politically, implement the Agreement and ensure it is worked through.  It is not possible for the Agreement to cover every aspect of every issue but it has broad parameters. Where there is an element of vagueness, democratically elected people, as they all are now, should be able to sit down together and find ways to move these matters on.  They can successfully do that if they concentrate on the issues.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issues I discussed in my numerous meetings with Prime Minister Blair, I did not discuss Mr. Pinochet with him directly, as an agenda item, although references were made during the informal meetings at Pörtschach in Austria two weeks ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the <Col N="55" /> specific question I tabled, namely, whether he raised in his discussions with representatives of the Republican movement the possibility of the destruction of arms and explosives by those in possession of them under the supervision of the independent International Commission on Decommissioning in accordance with the Decommissioning Act, 1997 and the Decommissioning Regulations, 1998 and, if so, the response he received?  It is obvious from the regulations that there is no question of any surrender being demanded &mdash; it is a matter of the paramilitary organisations destroying the weapons.  Did the Taoiseach make that point in particular to representatives of Sinn Féin and, if so, what response did he get?  Did he make the point to them that as there is no question of surrender, surely it is possible for Sinn Féin to convince the army council of the IRA, four of the seven members of which are leading members of Sinn Féin, of that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but I will repeat it here again when we have a wider audience.  The point Deputy Currie correctly makes is that under the supervision of the independent International Commission on Decommissioning, which is linked directly to the British-Irish Agreement, it is asked to co-operate with the chairman, General John de Chastelain.  In doing so, it would be honouring the Agreement and decommissioning arms to an international body under an international agreement.  Nobody could say that was a surrender. I know the Republican movement will not surrender arms to the RUC, the British Army or the British Administration, but it is not being asked to do that under these arrangements.  We are asking it to co-operate fully, in a way that is worked out by the chief negotiator for Sinn Féin in these discussions, and to use his influence under the Agreement to find a way of doing that. That would not be seen as a surrender and I hope it will happen under the arrangements and timescale laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the response of the Sinn Féin representatives to the argument that it would not be looked on as a surrender?  Did they say they could not convince the IRA of this?  How can that be said in circumstances where four of the seven members of the army council are leading members of Sinn Féin?  What excuse do they have for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this reasonable request?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  The PUP and Sinn Féin are not saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  They are saying they are committed to doing certain things under the Agreement and that they are adhering to that commitment.  They emphasise they are going further than that and they have appointed representatives to work with the International Commission on Decommissioning. <Col N="56" /> That is their answer to the question and it is in compliance with the terms.  Deputy Currie and myself would like that to happen yesterday, but I can only give him the reply I have been given, which is in conformity with the Agreement.  If we could make further progress it would be useful because what Deputy De Rossa said earlier is true; we are trying to move on all aspects of the Agreement and this is one of them. It should not be incremental for one group and not for the other.  All these points have been made endlessly by me.</P>

      <P>In regard to moving on all aspects of the Agreement, what aspects over which we have total control and responsibility can the Taoiseach accelerate, such as the point I raised on the Order of Business today, namely, the legislation required to be implemented by this House?  Can that be accelerated beyond the timetable the Taoiseach has already indicated which suggests it may not see the light of day until the end of February? Can that not now be prioritised?</P>
      <P>In relation to cross-Border bodies, will the Government indicate its willingness to merge the IDA with the IDB and to locate its headquarters in Belfast so as to provide the necessary confidence building measures which, in reference to the article written by Martin McGuinness in <i>The Irish Times</i> some days ago, would end the Sinn Féin-IRA impasse and in turn enable the Unionist community to have confidence in the composition of the shadow Executive?  Does the Taoiseach accept he has a unique responsibility to move forward unilaterally from this position to break the impasse, notwithstanding the difficulties that exist among the other parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has long since moved on.  We are the only party, and that includes the British Government and the NIO, which has moved comprehensively on North-South bodies, Strand Two and east-west arrangements. We have brought the North-South implementation bodies and the other areas of co-operation under the Agreement to near finality.  We have engaged in direct discussions with the NIO. We have talked to the parties and worked out a common position with Sinn Féin and, more particularly, with the SDLP.  We have given our working papers to other parties.  We have communicated directly with Mr. Trimble on these matters.  We have explained our position endlessly to the British Government.  We have advanced the human rights and equality legislation and consulted widely not only with political parties but also with the relevant organisations. We continue to move forward on the prisoners issue.  At every opportunity we are keeping apace with all the issues.  There have been delays because we could not get people to engage in the <Col N="57" /> discussions but I hope, since Monday, that has moved on.</P>

      <P>All of us in this House are experienced enough to know the degree of ambiguity that is necessary in an agreement of this kind to make it work.  As Séamus Mallon said, everybody must give everybody else sufficient elbow room to move and operate within their own constituencies.  Will the Taoiseach agree the difficulty for the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, is that there will be no leverage left to him in a situation where Sinn Féin representatives become members of the Executive?  If decommissioning does not occur within the two years, and in order for the Sinn Féin members to be removed as a result, there will be a requirement on the SDLP to support such a removal.  This would place the SDLP and Séamus Mallon in an intolerable position. It is essential, therefore, that this issue is resolved, not in the sense of total decommissioning this side of the two-year deadline but in terms of a genuine commitment to decommissioning in advance of Sinn Féin members taking up positions in an Executive.  The reality is that David Trimble will otherwise be left in an intolerable position.  Sinn Féin must be persuaded to make a move on this issue and it must encourage its colleagues in the Republican movement to follow suit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that action taken, North and South, in respect of prisoners, repatriation proposals, civil and human rights legislation, recognition of the languages of Irish and Ulster Scots and the movement of soldiers out of or into certain barracks will convince people that the process is real.  People in Northern Ireland continue to find reasons &mdash; whether from a military, policing or administrative point of view &mdash; to criticise what is happening.  For example, if soldiers are moved from out of a barracks people see it as rationalisation.  There are those who will argue that there are probably more soldiers on Northern Ireland's streets than there were before they were sent back to barracks.  I do not know how these things happen but we are obliged to relay them back from information we receive from the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the community, the churches and others.  However, if we can with confidence see that these things work, we hope people will see the sense of the point we are trying to make.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also inquired if I could foresee an Executive operating in Northern Ireland under the d'Hondt system without a gesture or movement by the international bodies.  The answer is that I cannot foresee such an eventuality.</P>

      <P>Lest there be a sense of singular focus in terms of the questions about the Chamber at present, I put it to the Taoiseach that party colleagues of mine &mdash; members of the Assembly and Belfast City Council &mdash; visited this House yesterday and expressed the growing concern <Col N="58" /> within the Nationalist and republican community in the North of Ireland &mdash; a concern which I believe is shared by the vast body of opinion in this State &mdash; at the passing of the 31 October deadline set out in the British-Irish Agreement.  Does the Taoiseach recognise people's deep concern at the real prospect of further slippage on the implementation of the Agreement and at the creation of a political vacuum into which may step the sectarian assassins who shot dead Brian Service in Belfast at the weekend?</P>
      <P>In defaulting on his undertakings, First Minister David Trimble is exercising &mdash; as I and many others see it &mdash; a veto on the will of the vast majority of the people of this island who voted in favour of the British-Irish Agreement.  Will the Taoiseach, in conjunction with the British Prime Minister, press for the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects and, centrally and crucially, the immediate establishment of the shadow executive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the points raised by the Deputy.  I will continue to work with the British Prime Minister to achieve what is desired but, equally, the various parties must also play their part.  As stated in reply to Deputy De Rossa's earlier question, that will require help and assistance from Sinn Féin when all of the institutional matters go live in February.</P>

      <P>Decommissioning weapons that are no longer necessary does not represent surrender. Has Sinn Féin expressed a view to the Taoiseach regarding whether it regards the decommissioning of weapons provided for under the Agreement as surrender?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin's representatives have never used those words in conversation with me but they were used in the two articles to which reference was made earlier and which appeared in May and September.  That is a mistaken view. I believe that the people who wrote those articles, presumably on behalf of the Provisional IRA and the PUP which hold precisely the same position on this issue, were wrong in their assertions. Decommissioning does not represent surrender. The other argument they put forward for not decommissioning is that with so many weapons available to other organisations they should hold on to theirs.  I do not agree with that view because it is unhelpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and service and Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration operations.  It has been active in this area for some time, has assisted operators in identifying Irish companies which can tender for work and has also assisted companies by identifying opportunities that are arising in petroleum exploration and production.</P>
      <P>There are no powers available to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services with the oil companies involved in off-shore exploration activities.  Responsibility as regards employment of workers and the provision of services and related issues is strictly a matter for the exploration companies and their contractors. There are no powers available to oblige operators engaged in exploration activities in the Irish offshore area to use Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services.  The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations.</P>
      <P>I will continue to do everything possible to encourage individual operators to provide Irish workers with opportunities to participate in off-shore activities.  My Department has written to SIPTU and the Irish Offshore Operators Association urging them to discuss the problem of employment in offshore exploration with the intention of arriving at an acceptable solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this was a bleak year for people involved in offshore oil exploration in terms of workers and the determination of the supply ship contract for Foynes? Does he also agree that Enterprise Oil's commitment to Ireland this year was minimal?  Having got away with that, it appears that the company's commitment in terms of exploration for next year lies with Aberdeen in Scotland.  Looking to the future, therefore, I was not filled with optimism by the Minister's reply.  It appears that Enterprise Oil has set a precedent for others involved in off-shore oil exploration activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to explorations currently under way, it has been optimistically noted that the company struck good quantities of gas and will <Col N="60" /> probably become involved in further exploration. Rather than continuing to utter pious platitudes, the Minister must take more forceful action to ensure that Irish workers are employed on off-shore oil rigs.  Under the exploration licensing terms issued by the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, in 1992, recruitment opportunities were to be were specifically earmarked for Irish workers.  It is regrettable that we have moved in the opposite direction.  Will the Minister take a more forceful stance on this issue than he has heretofore?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong on a number of points of fact.  I explained earlier that since 1992 I have been barred from taking action in this area by EU regulations.  I understand that people may state, with hindsight, that this happened before.  Many things happened prior to this country becoming a member of the EU and before people had equal rights to work throughout the EU.  That is the problem.  The company and the union involved are aware I made numerous efforts to get them to come together and work together and I will continue to do so.  I met the Irish workers on that rig.  They worked with the company supplying labour to the Sedco rig on different operations.  This was a short-term operation to carry out further investigation and to drill an exploration well.  The company told me it was willing to take on board Irish workers for the long haul and not only when it was offshore in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said he regarded the company's involvement as minimal.  In fact it spent in the order of £20 million on that exploration well.  It was prepared to spend at least £2 million to £3 million in Foynes but ultimately was not allowed do so.  It spent money in some other Irish ports. Given that the company was blocked at Foynes it went to Ayr.  I fear if that were to happen again in Irish ports, more of that business would go to Ayr and other locations.

      <Quest>the number of applications for financial assistance under the terms of the proposed £40 million package for the white fish fleet announced by him in June 1998; the number of new and second-hand vessels subvented; the level of grant provided for the purchase of safety equipment; the level of EU funding under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-9 for this grant aid package; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to update the House on progress of the programme for the renewal of the white fish fleet.  Some 138 applications have been received to date under the key elements of the renewal scheme.  I will announce successful applications for grant-aid for new vessels shortly and I will announce the successful applications for grant-aid for modern second-hand vessels by the end of the month and for vessel modernisations before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The vessel safety equipment scheme provides for grant-aid of 50 per cent for the purchase and fitting of essential safety gear.  I have announced one round of approvals to date and I will announce a further round shortly.  I consider this vessel safety equipment scheme of vital importance. The aim of this scheme is to encourage vessel owners to fit out vessels with specific on-board safety equipment.  Improved safety equipment on board vessels can play a vital part in the ongoing battle to protect life at sea.  The tragedies at sea this week bring home to us all the perilous working conditions that fishermen endure.  I again extend my sympathy to the families of all those involved in this week's tragedies.  The closing date for applications for safety grants is the last day of each month and I will ensure decisions are taken quickly.  I strongly urge fishermen to avail of this unique scheme.</P>
      <P>The whitefish fleet renewal programme is supported by EU grant aid of more than £6 million under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-9.  Support for the introduction of modern second-hand vessels is subvented by national funding alone.</P>
      <P>I secured in the 1998 Finance Act a significant package of tax reliefs to support and encourage investment in new and second-hand vessels and for modernisation of existing vessels.  There has been considerable interest in the tax measures as well, complementing closely the grant aid schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased, with Government colleagues, at the high level of interest in the programme for renewal of the whitefish fleet.  It underlines the appetite and need for reinvestment in the fleet right around the coast and confirms that the incentives on offer are proving attractive to a <Col N="62" /> wide range of fishermen.  I am determined to ensure the scheme fully delivers on the Government's objectives to revitalise the whitefish fleet and to support safety, jobs and competitiveness in the sector to the benefit of our coastal communities.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in extending my sympathy to the families of the bereaved; unfortunately this is becoming commonplace these days.  I am pleased at the provision of subventions for safety measures on board ship.  The main thrust of the question was to establish not only the number of applicants but the financial aspect of the scheme.  Will the Minister agree that more than 50 per cent of the total number of applicants will be from Donegal and 50 per cent of the total funding will be used in Donegal?  Given that the package is substantially over subscribed, will he review it after the two initial announcements have been made at the end of the month?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant response to the scheme, particularly from County Donegal.  Greencastle had the highest number of applications followed by Castletownbere and other ports.  This scheme is restricted to the whitefish fleet operators.  Donegal is famous for its pelagic fleet and the very large vessels.  I was particularly happy with the level of interest in the new vessels scheme.  The level of interest exceeded expectations as Deputy Bell outlined. BIM has evaluated all the applications received and this week has sent me a final report on the outcome of the valuation process.  That report is being examined in my Department and will come before me shortly.  I am determined to ensure the scheme fully delivers on the Government's object to revitalise the whitefish fleet.  When I have fully examined BIM's report and its implications I will be in a position to inform the House of any further measures required to deliver on the revitalisation of the whitefish fleet.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the reason he intends to extract 250,000 tonnes of gravel from the east coast to counteract coastal erosion at Bray, County Wicklow; if his attention has been drawn to fishermen's concerns in relation to the major impact on fishing stocks due to the situation of water and shellfish grounds and removal of the spawning beds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Bray Urban District Council plan to remove gravel from the Codling Bank to be used for coastal protection works at Bray north beach, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council followed the normal procedure which involved the preparation and publication of an environmental impact statement.  Objections which were made by a number of parties <Col N="63" /> including fishing interests were subsequently examined by my Department's specialist advisers.</P>
    <P>Consultants for Bray Urban District Council were asked to address these concerns.  According to the consultants the Codling Bank is 200 km square and the proposed dredge area is 0.255 km square or approximately 1/800 of the total area. They consider the possible adverse effects on fisheries to be minimal.  They say the whelks neither have specific spawning nor nursery areas and that it is possible to remove all the whelk from the proposed dredge area prior to dredging commencing.  The works are to be strictly monitored to ensure adverse effects, if any, are kept to a minimum.  A post extraction survey is to be carried out shortly after completion of the operation and one year thereafter.</P>
    <P>I have instructed that Bray UDC should ensure that adequate notice is given to allow for the removal of whelks from the proposed dredge area prior to dredging commencing.  A liaison arrangement has been provided to ensure that the concerns of fishermen continue to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware within his constituency of Howth of fishermen's concern about this issue.  Does he not consider this is a contradiction in terms because one of the main environmental threats to the conservation of fish and the protection of spawning areas has been the taking of aggregates from the sea? Although he said that only 0.255 kilometres will be affected, that will amount to the extraction of a quarter of a million tonnes of gravel.  Has he reassured fishermen along the coastline that there is no cause for concern about this issue?  Is he confident they need have no fears about this?  If so, why did he decide recently to establish a task force to reassure them?  Would it not have been better to have had consultations well in advance of this work rather than set up a task force subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Howth fishermen are prominent among the fishermen who are concerned.  This matter was examined in great detail by the specialists and by those responsible for ensuring the preservation of our fish stocks and the monitoring of spawning beds.  They know the business. There was a lack of communication which I addressed by arranging meetings with the Howth fishermen.  We indicated that every step that can be taken to preserve the fishing grounds will be taken.  We also indicated that only 1/800th of Codling Bank would be affected.  The matter has been thoroughly investigated and the experts are confident they know what they are doing in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the concerns of fishermen, I said I would establish a liaison group with the fishermen to enable them address any further concerns they may have, particularly in regard to this operation. As the Deputy will know, many good points are made before such proposed work, but <Col N="64" /> when it comes to the operation everything that was talked about is not necessarily done.  We want to make sure that everything that was talked about will happen.  It is particularly important that the liaison group be kept closely informed of proposed work, work during the extraction and any events thereafter.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern of the fish processing industry and the potential job losses as a result of the implementation of Multi Annual Guidance Programme IV in order to reduce days at sea.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of the fish processing sector and they briefed me fully on their concerns.  Their concern, like mine, is to ensure a sustainable future for the fish processing sector.  First and foremost this requires the proper conservation and management of fish stocks, which is the underlying objective of the new controls being introduced.</P>
      <P>It equally requires that the new effort management regime best matches the mutual needs of both the catching and processing sectors.  It is critical, therefore, that these sectors and my Department continue to work closely together to the benefit of the entire sector and the coastal communities dependent on fishing.</P>
      <P>To this end and in line with the recommendations of the herring task force review group, my Department, with the agreement of the catching side and the processing side, established a north west management advisory committee to manage the mackerel and herring stocks in the north west and the Celtic Sea management advisory group to manage the Celtic Sea herring fishery.  These groups comprise representatives from all sectors of the industry.  These management advisory committees must work to ensure that the pelagic fisheries are managed so as to maximise the benefits for the catching and processing sectors alike.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this hands on industry management will help to ensure the days at sea regime for the pelagic fleet under the Multi Annual Guidance Programme is managed in such a way as to ensure reliability and security of supply for Irish processors.  The operation of the days at sea regime for the pelagic fleet is under constant review with the industry to ensure that with co-operation the scheme can operate without detriment to the pelagic catching and processing sectors. I also look forward to the continuation of sound recommendations from the advisory committees on the management of the stocks that will bring a new level of co-operation into the sector to the benefit of all, particularly the coastal communities dependent on fishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many of the owners of small vessels are concerned <Col N="65" /> about the criteria used in regard to herring fishing?  They used to land their fish with fish processing units in Ireland.  Does the Minister consider that the operation will escalate to the position where fish will be processed in France, Scotland and Norway?  Does he consider that rather than vessels returning to Irish ports it would be more economic for them to transfer their cargoes to fish processing units in those locations?  I appreciate that scheme is in operation from 1998, but has the Minister considered the position prior to 1997 to ensure there are modifications and to allay the concerns of fish processors?  I am sure he will agree that having regard to funding for fish processing units and the average value of grants it is contradictory to have some of those fish processing units lying idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on that count.  The pelagic fisheries have management committees.  The Deputy mentioned the period 1996-7.  This scheme is in place for 1998-9.  I will do what the Deputy requested and ensure that, through the management committees particularly, we will examine the operation of the days at sea regime, particularly in 1999.  That is the most practical way to address this matter.  I did not want to have to do this type of thing, but the alternative was to take vessels out of the fleet. That is why this was set up.  I will bear in mind the position of smaller vessels.</P>

      <P>The introduction of incentivised quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and herring processing sectors was one of the key recommendations of the task force on the management and marketing of herring, which I established in November 1997 and which reported to me in March this year.  As I have previously advised the House, I secured Government approval in principle to the taking forward of the recommendations of the task force.  In line with the EU State Aid Guidelines requirements, Commission approval was sought to the quality training programmes for the herring industry.  I am pleased to say that the Commission's approval was given to my proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm to the House that the quality training programme for the dry-hold herring fleet, which will be run by my Department and BIM is scheduled for early this month.  The programme is being staggered over a two week period in order to facilitate ongoing fishing activity by the participants.  The objective is to significantly improve standards and operational practices in the dry-hold herring fleet, particularly in <Col N="66" /> relation to handling and discharge of produce. The fleet programme will provide intensive quality training for the skippers and crews of eligible vessels and will incentivise the introduction of on-board quality systems and practices.</P>
    <P>The training programme for the herring processing sector will be run jointly by my Department, BIM and the National Food Centre.  It will provide intensive quality training for key plant personnel designed to support an in-plant quality programme with a view to maximising product quality and value.  A pilot programme was launched on Monday last and the training programme is scheduled to take place before the end of the month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the concerns of Deputies about the <Col N="68" /> coastal erosion problems at Quilty, County Clare. I visited Quilty last week to see at first hand the extent of the problem and I had a very useful open meeting with the concerned residents.</P>
    <P>I confirm that we have received from Clare County Council a detailed report on the problems at Quilty, which was drawn up for the county council by consulting engineers.  The report sets out a number of options for addressing the erosion problems.  I have asked my Department's engineering division to assess the report and advise me on solutions as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>While available funding for coastal protection works in 1998 is already fully committed, I am giving high priority to the funding needs for a costed programme of works at Quilty in the context of the 1999 coastal protection programme.  I will be glad to keep Deputies fully appraised of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure he agrees that coastal erosion is a problem along the entire sea coast, especially the western seaboard.  What resources are at his disposal this year and next to address it?  The problem is especially serious in County Donegal, in areas such as Magheraroarty and Portnoo.</P>
      <P>The Minister had the sad duty to visit these areas during his trip to the county this week.  I associate myself with the remarks he made and extend my sympathy to the families of the bereaved who have suffered recently, especially the two Donegal families, the Boyles and the Moores, whom he visited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this is a major problem around the coast.  It will not get easier in the future, rather it will become an increasing problem. Funding of £5 million over five years has been made available, or approximately £1 million per year.  I understand a further question has been tabled on this matter.</P>
      <P>A little more than £1 million is available this year for this work.  The Estimates will be published next week when the figure for next year will be available.  As an experienced Member of the House, I know the Deputy will look to the Estimates to ascertain the position for next year. I am conscious of what is needed to address this matter.  I will be trying to do something further because we want to improve the volume of works.</P>
      <P>The problem at Quilty is urgent.  The Quilty to Kilkea road is about to be undermined and to start falling into the sea.  There is very little space between the road and the sea but some houses are located there and these are in great danger.</P>
      <P>Our main responsibility is for public property. There is a public road in danger at Quilty so I have no difficulty in addressing the problem.  It will be given priority in the coming year.</P>

In 1992 the County and City Managers' Association quantified the cost of dealing with coastal erosion at £120 million.

      <P>Ireland is shrinking.  It has also been scientifically established that it is sinking at a very slow rate, especially in certain areas in the southern half.  There is a great deal of solid rock in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The local authorities undertook a study which estimated the cost of addressing the problem at £120 million.  The cost of urgent works was estimated at approximately £35 million, which gives an idea of the seriousness of the problem.  The works in Bray would have taken up virtually all of the money allocated this year, however, that has been spread over two years so we can do some other works this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very big problem.  In 1992-3 only £100,000 to £200,000 was provided.  At least £1 million has been provided in the last couple of <Col N="70" /> years.  It remains to be seen if that can be improved on.  The Estimates will indicate the position for next year.  Another question has been tabled on the matter, which covers the EU input. Given the importance of the matter, I am working for a stronger programme here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector published in 1996, and approved by Government, provides for the undertaking of a doubling of the country's current level of forest area of approximately 600,000 hectares to 1.2 million hectares over a 35 year period.</P>
      <P>Some one million hectares of land in this country, predominantly wet mineral soils, are particularly suitable for afforestation.  There is also potential on the drier marginal soils for other conifers and broadleaves, specifically in high yield spruce crops.  Practically all of this land is owned by farmers who already account for the largest proportion of afforestation currently being undertaken &mdash; 81 per cent of the total in 1997 and 87 per cent of private afforestation.</P>
      <P>Farmers' participation in forestry is already supported by generous afforestation grants and premia, the latter particularly favouring farmers through higher rates and a longer period of payment. Farmers have seen the value in forestry as an alternative agricultural activity and an income and asset option and in many cases have reflected this by including forestry as one of their farm activities.  In this regard the implementing rules for the rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food, allows participants to plant trees on part of their lands and continue to farm the remainder of their lands in REPS.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently taking place with the relevant agencies with a view to closer linkages between forestry and REPS and I hope to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. He will no doubt be aware of the controversy that erupts not infrequently around the country because of the extent of afforestation in certain regions.  Interestingly, in his reply the Minister stated that farmers were already involved to a large extent in afforestation and that the grant scheme was geared towards them.  That is true to an extent but larger farmers are buying up marginal <Col N="71" /> land and planting it.  As far as the locals are concerned, it may as well be one of the large ranchers from the better parts of the country, as a large multinational company or an insurance firm.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to encourage farmers who have marginal lands and who may be in the rural environmental protection scheme, to plant three, four, five or ten acres of their own land, and not remove the benefits they currently enjoy under the REP scheme?  Would it be possible for them to continue to enjoy the incentives under the REP scheme and avail of the packages to assist afforestation?  Otherwise we will continue to meet our objectives of 18 per cent of afforestation and will have Ministers of all hues stating that farmers are involved, when in reality farmers from outside these areas are buying large tracts of land in marginal areas.  That is what I am trying to avoid.  I am pleased the Minister may make some announcements shortly.  In his review of the scheme, will he try to encourage people who are <i>in situ</i> on marginal land to get involved under the auspices of the REP scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is very timely and I would disagree with very little of what he had to say.  Consultations are continuing with various agencies to achieve precisely what the Deputy mentioned.  It will help us to achieve our targets in an environmentally friendly way as well as keep as many people as possible on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not accept that Coillte, the State afforestation board, and those involved in private afforestation, are expressing serious concern that they cannot get their hands on sufficient amounts of land to meet the national policy objective of 18 per cent?  The proposal I am making under the REP scheme is another way of meeting that 18 per cent target, but in a more socially harmonious way that would not set big farmers against small ones and would not mean rural communities in marginal areas would be decimated through people being forced off the land by excessive afforestation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated before, there is very little in what the Deputy said with which I could disagree.  I want to see harmony.  I do not want to achieve targets at any cost; I want to achieve them in the best interests of the country.  That means keeping as many people as possible on the land, which suggests the REP scheme is an ideal tool for aiding small farmers.</P>

      <P>I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Creed.  In discussing the matter with the various statutory agencies, will the Minister of State take into account what is nowadays called horizontal integration?  That is where different groups &mdash; including community organisations like Crann, which has considerable experience in <Col N="72" /> broadleaf forestry and local initiatives of this kind &mdash; can discuss among themselves at local level the REP and farm partnership schemes.  When the Minister of State is having these discussions, will he provide that alternative way of working instead of the current one whereby everything has to go through the Minister at the top, while community involvement takes place in isolation? Will the Minister of State introduce the concept of horizontal integration so that different groups can discuss matters at local level and the concerns Deputy Creed mentioned can be overcome locally?</P>

I believe in consultation and in listening to people on the ground.  If we are to achieve our targets in the best way possible we must listen to everyone involved at the coal face.</P>

      <P>No, not at all.  The question has been asked repeatedly and it was raised again here on the Adjournment.  People have suggested from time to time that there should be another tribunal or an inquiry.  In relation to any suggestion of an irregularity, as I stated previously on the Adjournment, the Secretary-General and the Accounting Officer of my Department, who has reviewed the relevant papers, has advised that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there is an impropriety of any kind in this matter. As I stated previously on the Adjournment, the Secretary General and Accounting Officer of my Department who has reviewed the relevant papers has advised that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest any impropriety of any kind in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the House to the reply by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Ivan Yates, to a parliamentary question on 15 May 1997 which sets out in detail the circumstances surrounding the sale of these lands. Notwithstanding that, there is some unease about some aspects of it.  An examination by the Committee of Public Accounts, in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General, might deal with the concerns expressed.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to ensure that the environment is not damaged as a result of recently opened mines, in particular the mine at Lisheen and Galmoy in the Laois and Offaly area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21975/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under current legislation matters relating to environmental issues in the broad sense are primarily the responsibility of the planning authority and the Environmental Protection Agency, and I am precluded from including conditions in State mining facilities which relate to matters which are specifically the responsibility of the EPA (i.e. emissions to air and water, waste disposal and noise).</P>
      <P>However, it is my practice to require that, before working commences on a State mining facility, planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence must be obtained.  Furthermore, a State mining licence is liable to revocation for the non-compliance with those or any other statutory permissions.  Because of the timing of its commencement, the Galmoy mine holds a water discharge licence and an air pollution licence from Kilkenny County Council rather than an integrated pollution control licence.  In all future cases, the developers must apply to the EPA for an IPCL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as mine closure and rehabilitation <Col N="74" /> are two of the most serious and sensitive issues for a mine, the developers of both Galmoy, which opened in 1997, and Lisheen, which is still under construction, were required to take out and maintain closure bonds in the name of the Minister and the relevant county council to ensure that the necessary funds are available to safely close the mines and restore the sites at the end of their useful lives, or in the event of premature closure. These bonds are index linked to maintain their real value.  In the case of Galmoy, £4.5 million is the sum and for Lisheen it is £9.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am a statutory consultee in both the planning and the IPC licensing processes and my Department examined both mining proposals, using both internal and external expertise, and furnished the relevant authorities with detailed views and recommendations.  I am satisfied that both operations are subject to rigorous environmental and planning conditions and are operating to the best international standards.</P>
    <P>The whole process of the public examination of applications, including the environmental impact statement, the setting of conditions in PL and IPCL and provision of closure bond, together with the ongoing monitoring by the inspectorates under the Minerals Development Acts, Planning Acts and EPA Act, ensures that all relevant matters are taken into account and that appropriate environmental awareness and sensitivity are practised.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will find copies of State mining facilities issued over the past 20 years or so in the Oireachtas Library.  Should he have difficulty in relation to a particular aspect of a State mining facility, my Department will be pleased to assist him.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the valuable contribution the mines at Galmoy and Lisheen make to the local economy.  Galmoy mine provides 160 long-term jobs and Lisheen Mine expects to provide some 300 jobs when in full production.  During the present construction phase some 500 jobs are being provided.  Jobs in mining are generally paid at above national average wage rates.  The contribution of these jobs to the local economy in what is otherwise, from an employment point of view, a depressed area, is significant.  In addition, as in all industries, there is a significant spin-off in job creation at local, regional and national level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the integrated pollution control licence application procedure generally takes place after planning permission has been granted and that for that reason the planning process is limited in that it is precluded from dealing with issues that come under the remit of the IPC licence?  Will he be making any recommendations in the light of that experience to his colleague in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, given his own brief in dealing with mining issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that the bonds which are put in place to carry out remedial work and <Col N="75" /> restore an area would be sufficient to pay for the ongoing monitoring that would be needed, as quite often it is remedial work that may result in further work being required down the line, depending on possible effects of a mining operation in the long term?  Is that built into the bond system?  If not, who should foot the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Lisheen mine, does the Minister have any responsibility in regard to the transportation of ores from where they are mined to a commercial port?  If it is exclusively by road there is an inherent risk and damage to the road surface, but transportation by rail would be more satisfactory.  Previous experience shows this can be done.  Does the Minister have any influence in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of transport and storage of ores is a matter for local government. There has been some public debate on that issue. I have no direct control over it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the integrated pollution control licence and the fact that it comes after planning permission has been granted, it is often asked why we do not control the whole lot together. The main thing is that nothing happens until everything is available.  A very careful and sensible approach is taken.  The Deputy may not have had the opportunity to see either Galmoy or Lisheen and the controls which operate on them. They are now world leaders in mining.  In relation to the proper, sensitive development of the mine and the security and safety elements, which are equally important, it is worth noting the attention that is being given in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point.  My point relates to a mine being given planning permission and then being unable to obtain an IPC licence so that it becomes a white elephant, which is very unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at all unlikely.  That happens in relation to foreshore licences.  We will not grant a foreshore licence unless we are satisfied that there is planning permission.  It might seem unusual, looking at the generality of other operations, but it is not unusual in my Department.  It is more usual that it would be the other way around, that the Department will not move until planning permission and everything else is in place.  These matters are dealt with thoroughly. That may have happened only in the last few years but it is the position now.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that section 15, which details the functions of a board of management, strikes a reasonable balance between the rights of school owners and parents, students, teachers and the community.  Deputy O'Shea requested the relevant constitutional provisions because I said there were legal and constitutional reasons for the wording in the Bill.  The relevant articles of the Constitution are 40.3.2º and 43.1.1º. Article 40.3.2º provides that the State shall, by its laws, protect as best it can from unjust attack the property rights of every citizen.  Article 43.1.1º acknowledges the property rights of private individuals. They are factors in the wording of section 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 110:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 14 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) support the characteristic spirit of the school as determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious or social values and traditions which inform and underpin the objectives of the school,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the language in the subsection I seek to amend rather strong.  It is almost the language of <Col N="78" /> a siege.  It states that a board of management will uphold the characteristic spirit of a school and that it will be accountable to the patron for so upholding.  Why is such strong language needed? It suggests a school under siege which the board of management must resist with an eye over its shoulder to the patron to whom it is accountable. It is particularly strong to state that the characteristic spirit of the school be upheld.  Is it necessary to have such strong language?  My wording, which states that the characteristic spirit of the school be supported, is more appropriate than that which states that the board of management be held accountable by the patron for upholding that characteristic spirit.</P>
    <P>The subsection later requires that the board of management:</P>
    <P>act in accordance with any Act of the Oireachtas or instrument made thereunder, deed, charter, articles of management or other such instrument relating to the establishment or operation of the school.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to state that?  Is it not taken for granted that a board of management charged with managing a school would act within the law and within the Acts of the Oireachtas?  I find it an extraordinarily trenchant subsection which really should be the mission statement of a board of management.  Why is all this confrontational language needed and why is it necessary to state the obvious?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree the language is confrontational. It is reflective of the balance which must be struck between the various stakeholders in the education system.  It is a carefully structured balance of rights and interests.  The patron owns the school and has generally been responsible for the characteristic ethos which marks and defines it.  In terms of existing articles of management and charters, it is not possible for the House to ignore the fact that we are legislating not for a greenfield education system but for one which is generations old.  We cannot dispense with agreements already entered into with a number of trustees.</P>
      <P>Different partners at different levels sought this provision.  For example, at primary level, the deeds of variation have been agreed between all partners in education, including teachers, parents' groups and patrons.  It is important that be given legislative effect.  In the case of the deeds of trust for community schools, which are long in existence in some cases, the partners involved were anxious that the Bill would not undermine those. I had no difficulty in accommodating that in the wording presented to the House, which ensures any agreements between the partners and any articles of association are not undermined by the Bill.  Deputy O'Shea said strong language was used in the subsection but I am satisfied it is a reasonable balance.</P>

However, it is superfluous to state that a board of management should act in accordance with Acts of the Oireachtas and instruments thereunder.  That is implicit in any organisation or agency established by the State, unless such have been established which are not expected to act within the law.  I am not aware of any having been established in my time as a Deputy.</P>
      <P>Stating that someone should uphold something and that they be accountable for doing so is unnecessarily strong.  The Minister does not share that view but the word &ldquo;support&rdquo; is sufficient. The subsection effectively states that the board of management is legally accountable for upholding the characteristic spirit of the school.  We spoke this morning of people acting in good faith not being liable for things which go wrong in the management of schools.  The language in the subsection is not the sort which should be used to describe a relationship which is, in effect, a partnership. It is the partners in education coming together to provide education for children.  This subsection is trenchant and I do not accept that it is necessary or appropriate in this context.</P>

      <P>There has not been a negative response to the wording included in the Bill.  I would not be as trenchant as the Deputy, even though it could be argued that some of the amendments tabled by Opposition Members are also superfluous.  To make the position clear, references to the need for boards to comply with Acts of the Oireachtas, etc., are included.  It is important, however, that the Bill does not undermine existing agreements, that it respects the rights and responsibilities of the partners in education. It should not unilaterally alter or take precedence over those agreements.  It would be foolhardy to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 112 in the name of the Minister meets my concerns.  There should be clear policies on suspensions and expulsions.  The Department has issued guidelines but in the case of secondary schools they do not have full force and the practice has been loose.  I am certain that when the Minister introduces the school attendance Bill <Col N="81" /> suspensions will have to be notified.  Under the existing Act figures on non-attendance are supposed to be collated and maintained by the Department.  The Garda Siochána are also supposed to be notified but this does not happen in practice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment and hope much more attention will be paid to policies in this area.  The negative feelings which result in early school leaving stem from poor discipline policies.  There is scope for policy innovation which I hope the Bill will encourage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(h) ensure that the rights of conscience of children from families who do not share the ethos of the school are respected in all school activities.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not need to spell out the background to this <Col N="82" /> amendment.  It seeks to protect the right of conscience of children attending schools whose ethos they do not share.  While the Minister may say this is understood or inferred it should be clearly stated in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 119 proposes that children should not receive instruction in a religion which does not have the approval of their parents and ensures that children from families who do not share the ethos of the school are not discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 162 refers to the section of the Bill which relates to curriculum.  The amendment seeks to state clearly that religious instruction is included among the subjects in which a student should not be required to receive instruction if doing so would be contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or of the student if he or she has reached 18 years.</P>
    <P>The common theme of these amendments is that the right of conscience of individual students should be protected in all circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be recommended in these amendments.  It should be taken as read that the rights of children who do not share the majority ethos in a school should be respected.  The school must respect their rights and equally, students and parents must respect the ethos of the school.  Deputy O'Shea's amendments strike that balance and they add something of value to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree in principle with these amendments but the protection they seek is in the Bill already.  Section 30 (2)(d) states, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), that the Minister shall not require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student.  The Minister will be obliged to issue regulations to that effect which boards of management will implement.  The Bill places an obligation on the Minister to ensure that students will not be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 118, section 15(2)(d) requires that a board of management shall have regard to the principles and requirements of a democratic society and have respect and promote respect for the diversity of values, beliefs, traditions, languages and ways of life in society.</P>
      <P>The wording of that section could be strengthened when the Bill is debated in the Seanad.  The words &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; could be strengthened and perhaps replaced by &ldquo;respect&rdquo;.  I am satisfied the wording in the Bill meets the objective of protecting the rights of conscience of students.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 32, to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 16 deals with the dissolution of a board of management by a patron.  Section 16(7) states that:</P>
      <P>The patron shall provide, in accordance with section 14, for the re-establishment of a board dissolved under subsection (1) not later than six months following the dissolution or such longer period as the patron, with the consent of the Minister, considers appropriate and when the new board has been established the functions of the dissolved board shall be revested. .</P>
      <P>Where a board has been dissolved it is essential that a new board is put in place as quickly as possible. My amendment does not interfere with the right of the Minister to agree to a longer period if the patron, with the consent of the Minister considers that appropriate.  However, the initial time period should be three rather than six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The six months is only an upper limit.  If a board can be re-established within the six months, that can be achieved under the Act. As regards the new boards of management which are being established at primary level, we have had some examples within the past six months of failures to elect the full boards based on the deed of variations.  Many of these disagreements &mdash; I am aware of three cases &mdash; have centred on the difficulty in finding agreement on the two external representatives on the bodies.  I do not want to be too judgmental but many of the difficulties have their roots in personality differences.</P>
      <P>My strong advice is that six months is a reasonable time to allow those difficulties to subside and to try to rebuild confidences so that things are on an even keel again.  In some cases that may involve the appointment of a facilitator by the Department to try to resolve the difficulties which exist between the various partners on the board.  If we have a limit of three months, there is a danger that we might rush the process.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's concerns because it is not satisfactory for one person to organise everything for six months.  However, where this happens, it is clear that there is a serious breakdown between the partners.  In order to restore that, it is necessary to give reasonable breathing space to allow the situation to be retrieved and a new one to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reflects the deed of variations at primary level which also had a six months clause if there <Col N="84" /> was disagreement between the partners.  The Minister can intervene only after six months.  It is helpful that the Minister can intervene because he can act as a catalyst to sort out the situation. My experience to date is that six months are needed to work it out and to allow people to cool down and start again.</P>

      <P>In page 20, line 12, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment which relates to the keeping of accounts and records.  Section 18(1) states:</P>
      <P>Except in the case of a school established or maintained by a vocational education committee, a board shall keep all proper and usual accounts and records of all monies received by it or expenditure of such monies incurred by it and shall ensure that in each year all such accounts are properly audited or certified in accordance with best accounting practice.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is incorrect.  It should read: &ldquo;accounts are properly audited and certified in accordance with best accounting practice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 122 states:</P>
      <P>In page 20, lines 15 to 17, to delete &ldquo;in so far as those accounts relate to monies provided in accordance with section 12&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this issue on Committee Stage. Funds, other than those paid by the Oireachtas, accrue to school management boards under section 12.  Schools often have unhappy experiences in terms of funding.  A distinction should not be made between moneys paid by the Oireachtas and other moneys properly paid into the accounts of the board of management.  Once that money is in the account, it must be disbursed in a proper fashion by the board in the interests of the school.</P>

      <P>We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 121a would oblige schools to both certify and audit their accounts.

      <P>I made that concession on Committee Stage and I do not propose to include the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 122, we are strongly of the view that our function is to inspect accounts for all Exchequer moneys allocated to schools.  That satisfies the public interest in ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent efficiently.  It also respects the autonomy of schools.  We talk a lot about the fact that boards of management should have certain freedoms and be in a position to manage their own affairs.  Part of that process should be to trust the boards.  If they raise money, they have a function to the wider school community to ensure that it is properly disbursed and that certified accounts are kept.  Our legal advice is that school authorities have particular responsibility for showing good financial management, but it is not our function to become involved in moneys which are not discharged by the taxpayer. We do not have that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to this issue.  A question could be tabled in the Dáil on the level of fund-raising done by particular schools so that the Department gets an overview of how money is collected in some areas and not in others.  I spoke to the principal of one school earlier this year who told me that a parents council provides whatever money is required.  I accept we should protect the taxpayers' money but why should a distinction be made between the inspection of Exchequer moneys and those given to a board of management by an outside body?  If the Department does not give full autonomy to a school in terms of Exchequer moneys, why does it give it full autonomy for other moneys received?</P>
      <P>It is in everyone's interest to have external checks on how moneys are disbursed in particular schools.  What happens if money is donated by parents to a particular school but no proportion of it is used for special needs pupils?  The Minister may say that is a policy decision for the school.  It might not be a bad idea if an inspector examined the accounts and drew attention to how funds were disbursed.  Human nature being what it is, funds are occasionally misappropriated.  I am not saying this lightly as I have some experience of the matter. It is a mistake that there is not a full accounting procedure as regards moneys which are paid into school accounts.</P>
      <P>As regards the auditing and certification of accounts, why does an audit cost so much?  My understanding is that an auditor signs and certifies an audit.  What is the difference between auditing and certifying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see why the Department might not want the Minister to have full responsibility for school accounts as he would then have responsibility for the financial probity of operations for which he is not responsible to the Dáil. However, he would be a secondary party as he would be informed if circumstances went wrong <Col N="86" /> and then asked what did he do about it?  I can see how a Minister might not want that.</P>
      <P>However, it is hard to reconcile that with the Minister's later refusal to agree that parents should be given an annual report by the school. Either he says this is a matter for the school, the board and the parents, in which case the parents have a right to an annual report, or he says, as Deputy O'Shea is requesting, this is a matter of which he should be informed and he will keep an eye on it.  He cannot have it both ways.  He either agrees that parents should be issued with an annual report which deals <i>inter alia</i> with their finances and matters relating to the school or he takes some responsibility on his own shoulders, which is the implication of Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  There is a case for going in either direction but the Minister is giving us the worst of both worlds.</P>

    <P>Auditing is a much more expensive process than certifying.  We are talking about two, three and four teacher schools and at the other end of the scale 1,000 pupil schools.  We are covering the entire spectrum.  There are different levels of fundraising <Col N="87" /> as some schools operate greater funds than others.  Vocational education colleges, which tend to be community colleges, must submit accounts to the VEC, or in the case of sports complexes, to the trustees who govern them.

It is not directly relevant to this section, but one of the great crises in universities for many years was that if the State found out too much about any private moneys they raised it could cut back on State subventions.  This acted as a disincentive to organisations to raise money.  While it is desirable that we have some idea of what is happening in fundraising in schools, they would get worried if they thought the Department was prying too much into how much they were raising.  This would have a subsequent impact on policy and resource allocation.  If that is part of the agenda, a school may feel there is little point in raising money as the Department may withdraw resources from it if it seems to be doing well in fundraising.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister was not suggesting our third level institutions would conceal money to dupe the Department and extract more money from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was making the opposite point that third level institutions felt there was a danger the State would pat them on the back for raising private moneys and take back State moneys <i>in lieu</i>, whereas what we should do is encourage institutions to collect as much money as they can while the State maintains its obligation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Implied in that is that the moneys would be conceded and the State would make decisions in less than full knowledge of the funding of third level colleges.  However, that is incidental as we are discussing first and second level schools.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's explanation of the auditing and certifying of accounts.  Some smaller schools will want to discharge their obligations in the cheapest yet most effective and efficient way possible.  I will not press the amendment dealing with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards moneys which are lodged in the accounts of boards of management, there is not a sustainable case that where State moneys are combined with other moneys, the State should not know what is happening to them.  One of the difficulties in this area is that some schools can obtain any financing they need from parents <Col N="88" /> while other schools cannot.  Global information on voluntary funding of schools is valuable.  In terms of the integrity of the system, it helps efficiency and the effective use of all resources if there is an obligation to account for all moneys paid into boards of management accounts.</P>
    <P>One can say that if a board of management gets money from a parents association to do X and it decides to do Y, it is a matter between the association and the board.  However, it goes further than that.  The Department cannot walk away from its responsibility for the management of schools.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 122 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 123:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 44, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed the idea of issuing to parents annual reports on a school's activities.  The previous incarnation of the Bill provided for such a report but the Minister dropped that requirement, making it merely an option.  He expressed the view that annual reports were often a waste of money, citing the example of Cork Corporation, but I would beg to disagree &mdash; the discipline of producing an annual report is healthy.  Many Departments fail to produce annual reports of their activities, which is lamentable.</P>
      <P>Given that schools will be developing five year plans, it behoves them to report to parents each year about how the plans are progressing.  That is particularly important in the case of schools which seek voluntary donations from parents, amounting to perhaps £25 million at primary level and a similar amount at secondary level.  Parents have a substantial interest, both in terms of their children and the money they are giving to the school, in seeing a report of what is happening. The Minister suggested on Committee Stage that it would be much better to call a meeting but many parents would not attend for one reason or another and often there are no meaningful exchanges, whereas a report with significant information might become the subject of a meeting and would result in a much more meaningful exchange of views.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter, even at this late stage.  We are not talking about one teacher schools bringing in consultants to draw up reports but where the school has drawn up a plan, as it must under the Bill, we are asking that it should examine how it will tackle out of school activities, improve reading abilities, etc. and should report each year on whether progress was made and, if not, why not.  This would give the parents a more meaningful role than in an occasional meeting.  Such events are not always the most meaningful exercises because there is an imbalance of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> This is not a free ride &mdash; producing a report is a discipline but it is worthwhile because it requires one to reflect on what one has done over the year.  During the summer break, schools can look back over the year, make a report on the previous year's activities and give an outlook for the coming year.  That is a useful discipline for any school, whether it has one teacher or 25 teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which appeals to me in the context of enunciating the principles in a school plan and in reporting how successful a school has been in putting such measures into place.  As Deputy Bruton said, no matter what we are doing it is important that we reflect and report on it, because it is as good an exercise for the provider as for the receiver.  I taught for 20 years in national schools, and at the end of each year one gave parents a report on their children.  Different schools have different types of report sheets but by and large they are of a decent standard.  It is important for parents to feel a sense of ownership of their school, to be fully aware of what is happening and the progress being made.  I do not suggest that parents would become inspectors of a kind, I mean this in a positive way.  If parents feel there are shortfalls in provision, they may be encouraged to approach the private sector for donations, etc.  This is important in areas like information technology because our schools require many more computers and the Minister has indicated that he welcomes the input of private sector resources.</P>
      <P>Good quality reporting is crucial.  This may be a consequence of EU membership, but as Dáil Deputies we receive publications every day and if a pupil submitted to a teacher writing of the standard found in some of these reports they would be told to write it in fewer words rather than in excessive verbiage.  I recently studied a report of a sub-committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which contained many meaningless phrases that added nothing.  People use these phrases all the time but they are of little value.  Perhaps the Department could suggest a framework for presenting the information in a school report in a consumer friendly fashion, because the worst thing a school could do would be to send out a document full of educational jargon which is not readily understood by people outside the field.  Only a small change is required by this amendment and it would not incur great expense on the State, other than the Department's inspectorate or press office providing advice to boards of management on doing the job efficiently and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which strikes me in talking to parents is how little they know about what goes on. This morning I mentioned how little they know about the provision within the system for special needs, such as the establishment of a psychological service.  We cannot communicate that information often enough because it raises morale and gives people hope and a better focus.  Against a <Col N="90" /> background of misinformation or a lack of information, people feel abandoned and that no one cares about the problems faced by their children. If we do not seek to communicate regularly at school level it is difficult to see how the Department can communicate effectively.  Schools should produce a report on their activities.  They should produce annually a clear statement of their objectives, the number of those objectives that have been achieved and the way in which school plans will be amended to cater for other special needs of pupils that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My views have not changed dramatically since we discussed this matter at some length on Committee Stage.  This section obliges boards of management to establish procedures for informing the parents of children in schools of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school.  Such procedures may include the publication and circulation to parents, teachers, other staff and the student council, where one is established, of a report on the operation and performance of the school in any school year.</P>
      <P>The difference of opinion is whether we should compel schools to do this.  In framing this Bill, I was anxious to remove the heavy hand of bureaucracy in terms of telling schools what to do on every issue.  I identified the development of a school plan as essential and we made provision for that in the Bill as well as provision for regular updating of the plan, as agreed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>For the reasons Deputy O'Shea outlined in respect of the verbiage in the many annual reports we currently receive, I retain a healthy scepticism of the value of forcing schools to produce annual reports against their will.  Some schools prepare monthly reports on specific issues and we should not underestimate their capacity to develop better ways of communicating with parents than simply producing the annual report. There is an element of &ldquo;we know best and we will tell them what to do&rdquo; in this.  That might deteriorate into a situation where a principal could tell a teacher to write a report because under the Act it has to be in by 30 June.  I am not sure what type of discipline that is but the school plan is a better discipline and a much more comprehensive exercise than the mere compilation of an annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout my public life I have been deluged with annual reports from various bodies and, to be frank, they tend to be sanitised versions of what is happening in the organisation.  They comment on the general headings but do not contain any new ideas.  I wonder how many people read annual reports.  Perhaps I am wrong but I have a certain amount of scepticism about them.  The school plan is a better exercise because there is more active involvement on the part of the staff, parents and the school community in determining school policy and achieving objectives.  That is a good dynamic in terms of developing a set of policy <Col N="91" /> objectives and putting in place the mechanisms to deliver those objectives.</P>
    <P>I am dubious about the value of the annual report mechanism.  Deputy Bruton is negative about the meeting process; perhaps he has had bad experiences in that regard.  Some meetings are very worthwhile.  We are talking about the operational performance of schools and that should not be left to the annual report.  It should be an ongoing process.  It could relate to the introduction of a new syllabus or other matters and there may be a necessity for schools to keep parents informed on a more regular basis.  That can be done by way of meetings, weekly or monthly bulletins, etc.</P>
    <P>I prefer not to be overly prescriptive in determining how boards should do this but we must not lose sight of the fact that we are placing a strong obligation on them to establish procedures for informing the parents of children about the operation and performance of the school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ fundamentally with the Minister on this issue.  Many a plan has been a waste of effort because nobody ever bothered to ask if any of the objectives were achieved.  Five year plans are notorious for setting out worthy objectives that nobody ever thinks about until the time comes for the next five year plan to be produced. The annual review is a critical element of making the school plan a meaningful process.  The Minister likes the idea of school plans but he is not particularly interested that they be reviewed annually and reported on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a contradiction.  We should ensure that the operational performance of a school in any year is reported, and to leave that as a possibility rather than a requirement is foolish.  The section as it now stands simply requires that they establish procedures.  That could be a meeting with parents or a meeting to discuss school meals or traffic congestion at the school entrance.  There is no requirement that it be a meaningful examination of whether the school plan is being implemented and the improvements that can be made.  That is why the annual report is so valuable.  It is a discipline on those involved in running the school in that they must report each year on their examination of these issues.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. The notion of an annual plan will not be onerous but over time some schools will produce excellent annual reports highlighting ways of reporting to parents.  Parents in other schools will want to be informed of the various issues the school down the road is reporting on.  A more meaningful participation will evolve out of such annual reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently attended a meeting in a <Col N="92" /> primary school during which there was an excellent presentation on information technology in the school.  The meeting was well attended but that was only one aspect of what was happening in the school.  There were no presentations on other subjects.  Information technology seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; subject of late, although I believe the three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo; still have their place.  I have read documents circulated by schools which were of a high standard but those of us involved in education who are familiar with the jargon and the structures sometimes take it for granted that in certain fundamental areas there is not a great deal of knowledge among sections of the community and that information must be constantly distributed.</P>
      <P>I accept different schools are better in certain matters but there should be an obligation on schools to communicate with parents in relation to the school plan.  Plans are aspirational but achievement, or lack of it, is what the report would contain.</P>
      <P>Another danger with reports is that many schools are in competition for pupils.  I may want to present my annual report in a way that is most appealing to parents and I will see most of the pupils in the general catchment area when they enrol for the first time the following September. That is why the Department must have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to proceed in the desired manner we must put in place a definite structure in terms of reporting.  Some schools will do a great deal while others will do little and that is the nub of the problem.  It is often parents, with whom we must communicate, who end up being the losers in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This returns to the point that some schools will do a great deal while others will do little.  It would be wrong to believe that a fundamental difference will be bought about in terms of motivation and dynamics in schools by Marlborough St. stating in legislation that schools shall produce annual reports.  Marlborough St. will never be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but this would be more achievable if a devolved structure was put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be less achievable because the devolved structure proposed in the Education (No. 1) Bill advocated the recentralisation of an already centralised model.  However, I do not intend to debate that matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are arguing about which is better, a school plan or an annual report.  From experience I can state that the school plan is obviously far more important.  Most teachers and parents have stated, in areas where school plans are being developed, that they are a worthwhile exercise. <Col N="93" /> In my opinion the compilation of an annual report has much less value than the development and formulation of a school plan.  There is no comparison between the impact of a school plan and that of an annual report.  I have a healthy scepticism as regards annual reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to his experience with the information technology seminar.  I submit that this was probably a far better experience than reading a paragraph in an annual report on the school's information technology policy.  It is far better to visit a school and discover what is happening by questioning a teacher or practitioner than it is to read two to three paragraphs in an annual report, which will never convey the excitement, enthusiasm or brilliance of the teacher concerned or the degree to which children interact with and use technology.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the development of further initiatives of this kind because people will gain a real insight into what is happening in schools if such exchanges take place.  That is why the Bill places an obligation on the boards to establish procedures to inform parents.  However, we are allowing schools flexibility in terms of the types of procedures they will establish or the mechanisms by which they will inform parents.  That is the nature of providing local autonomy.  It is for this reason we want to establish boards of management with some reasonable degree of manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>I was anxious that the Bill should not be as prescriptive as the Education (No. 1) Bill or as centrally directed in terms of our telling boards what action to take and expecting them to deal with a heavy bureaucratic workload and produce endless reports.  The school plan is the central element on which I have concentrated, which is very important.  School plans will not be reviewed by means of annual reports, they will include an in-built evaluation dimension.  The Bill was amended on Committee Stage to ensure that school plans will be regularly reviewed and updated.  In terms of whether the objectives of school plans are being achieved or realised, that is part and parcel of the school plan exercise itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has become carried away by the rhetoric which led him to make certain changes in the Bill.  There is no doubt that a number of those changes are welcome.  Many people believe the Minister displayed a lighter touch in terms of some of the things he has done while others believe he missed the opportunity to devolve power.  However, we will not embark upon that debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ludicrous for the Minister to suggest that it is too prescriptive to ask an organisation as important as a school to produce an annual report for parents, who are its shareholders and partners. Regardless of their size &mdash; some branches of political organisations contain only nine members &mdash; clubs of all kinds are obliged to provide annual reports to their membership regarding how they spent money, what activities they pursued and if they pursued prescribed activities such as the collection <Col N="94" /> of money.  Local branch organisations affiliated to political parties are obliged to report on whether they carried out the activities they are directed to carry out under the constitution of those parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that it is too prescriptive to ask schools to produce annual reports shows that he has been carried away by a view he held in the past.  We must deconstruct the logic of his argument.  The Minister stated that school plans are crucial.  However, I have witnessed and participated in the formulation of many plans only to see them promptly ignored.  Such plans are merely forgotten when circumstances change. The discipline of an annual report in the context of school planning is that it provides a benchmark whereby school authorities can question whether their plans were unrealistic and, if not, they can ask why certain courses of action were not pursued.</P>
    <P>We are not discussing local pigeon clubs, we are concerned with institutions which take charge of our community's most important asset.  It is not asking much to request that schools should report to parents yearly on how they deal with the stewardship of their children.  That is all that is at stake here.  The Minister used the terms &ldquo;heavy handedness&rdquo;, &ldquo;excessively prescriptive&rdquo; and &ldquo;looking to specify every detail&rdquo; but the debate has not centred on those points.  I could understand it if schools were offended if the Minister required them, as many businesses are required under EU regulations, to complete an endless number of forms.  We suggest that schools should develop their own reportage based on their school plan, which would be the main document, and that they and parents should choose the topics upon which they should report.  Schools should be obliged to accede to a parent's request for it to report on a certain issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gotten carried away with himself and he has missed the opportunity to do something which would have been seen to be meaningful in the long term.  He is correct to state that the holder of his office cannot produce quality annual reports from Marlborough St. , but he could create a framework to provide a reasonable opportunity for their development.  That is all that is suggested in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 124:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 48, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;equality of treatment and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seeks to amend the section we have been debating for some time in respect of whether annual reports should be provided.  The section is entitled &ldquo;Report and information&rdquo; and it sets out <Col N="95" /> to establish procedures for informing the parents of children in schools of matters relating to the operation and performance of the schools.  The amendment seeks to change the text of the later part of the section to read &ldquo;with particular reference to the achievement of equality of treatment and objectives as set out in the school plan provided for under section 22.&rdquo; Why is that important?  It is important for a number of reasons.  I refer to the definition of special needs. As I see it special needs relate to children with a disability, whether physical or sensory, intellectual disability, gifted children and those who are not performing because of social and environmental factors.  A school plan, if it is to serve its fundamental purpose, must address the whole area of special needs, for example, how the school will adapt its environment to suit children with a physical disability, an intellectual disability or those who are presenting with dysfunctional behaviour.  It is vital that in a planned and structured way the needs of individual children are diagnosed and assessed and that individual plans are part of the overall school plan.</P>
    <P>In the mission statement, which would appear at the introduction of the school plan, there should be a definite commitment to equality of treatment.  I firmly believe that unless we present these areas in the context of the legislation there will be a tendency in some instances to bypass the difficulties.  It is absolutely essential that the first school plan produced in each school, following this legislation, should address itself to equality of treatment.  Equality of treatment means that all children, irrespective of their particular need, will be given the same education route, that is, the wherewithal to develop to the fullness of their potential in the school.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response to this fundamental and extremely important issue.  I have said more than once there is a deteriorating situation which, to an extent, the system is denying, involving serious discipline problems.  Schools are not always ready to make this public because parents can lose confidence in particular schools if they are upfront about the discipline difficulties being encountered.  Other schools which encounter equal if not more exacting difficulties but who sing mum may be performing at a more effective level.  This amendment seeks to insert &ldquo;equality of treatment&rdquo; as the area of particular reference and I hope the Minister will respond positively to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address my own amendment No. 129 which is in the same spirit as that articulated by Deputy O'Shea.  I note the Minister is sponsoring amendment No. 126 which seeks to insert the following: &ldquo;(2) The school plan shall state the objectives of the school relating to equality of access to and participation in the school.  .&rdquo; That is welcome.  The only point I would make in defence of my amendment is that terms such as &ldquo;equality of access&rdquo; and &ldquo;participation&rdquo;<Col N="96" /> are lofty and are not always clear.  I believe equality of treatment involves discrimination in access in many cases.  There are children with special needs who have to get discriminately additional support.  It is not only a question of equality but of premium in some ways.  That is the reason I favour the formulation that made explicit reference to tackling the needs of pupils likely to suffer an educational disadvantage, integrating pupils with special needs and building structures with parents to promote their active involvement in the education of their children. This element is missed in the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>An essential ingredient of any policy seeking to help children who are educationally disadvantaged is the support of parents.  Many of the policies developed recently, such as the home school liaison scheme, recognises the importance of parents' involvement in successfully tackling equality of participation.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the lofty rhetoric surrounding equality of participation needs to be distilled down to what it means.  Deputy O'Shea said it means that appropriate access is provided to a school for a child with a special need.  If that means he needs speech therapy or special equipment to participate they will be provided.  That is why I favour in my amendment a more explicit reference to what we want specified.</P>
      <P>In the development of directions the Minister can be explicit in relation to what we need.  Will he distil down some practical elements he expects the school plan to address so that it can fulfil what is described in his amendment as &ldquo;equality of access to and participation&rdquo; but for practical purposes should be described in a more concrete way for schools when the directions are issued?</P>
      <P>I am happy to accept the Minister's amendment as an alternative.  When developing these directions which he may give from time to time will he make concrete what he means by equality of treatment?  In other words, he expects objectives in relation to physical access if there are children with special needs, access to speech therapy or involvement with parents who may have had negative experiences in school themselves.  These are matters that should be addressed in a plan which tries to meaningfully integrate children who may otherwise drop out of the school system before their time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the motivation of both Deputies.  My amendment No. 126 was formulated to accommodate the broad thrust of amendments Nos. 129, 131 and 134.  Amendment No. 126 is a statement relating to equality of access to and participation in the school and is all-embracing. We have to be careful not to write into the Bill the school plan or the paramaters which it should embrace.  The Department and the Minister will issue clear directions and guidelines to schools on what should be included in drawing up a school plan.  In some of the Breaking the Cycle schools a pilot scheme has been initiated and <Col N="97" /> draft guidelines are being prepared for a school plan.  I have some sympathy with Deputy O'Shea's amendment No. 134.  It is not necessary to include amendment No. 124 because the principles of equality of rights and treatment underpin all aspects of the Bill.  Therefore, it does not require specific mentioning.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 134, we agreed at an earlier section that we wanted responsibility for the provision of children with special needs and proper planning in that area to rest with the Minister of the day.  I have no difficulty incorporating the drawing up of an inclusive plan for students with special needs, but we must decide whether to make that a function of the board or of the principal and teachers.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment proposes it should be the responsibility of the principal and the teachers.</P>

That would meet the Deputy's objective.  I will draft such an amendment and table it when the Bill goes to the Seanad.  It is understood that it is implied we should do that, but I accept the Deputy's point that we want to make sure there is a statutory obligation to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 21, line 5, after &ldquo;accordance&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with procedures adopted by the board following consultations with the partners in the school and with the Inspectorate and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to a board's consultation with parents and teachers in the framing of a school plan.  I favour an explicit reference to consultation between the board and the partners and the inspectorate to facilitate the participation of parents, school partners and the inspectorate, where it has a valuable input to make to the school plan.  Inspectors would have experience to bring to bear on the development of school plans. I favour a much more proactive advocate role for the inspectorate rather than the old role of examining what is happening.  To ensure the inspectorate has a more proactive role, it should act as a support resource for the development of school plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many schools would find great difficulty in producing good quality school plans without the involvement of the inspectorate and the resources of the Department.  Parents who are very articulate and have access to the services of accountants and planners will not find it difficult to articulate a school plan, but those who do not have access to those resources will have to fall back on the Department as a resource to support the formulation of those plans.  In its changing role, the inspectorate could play a useful role as a backup resource for schools.  Otherwise, I fear that the best laid plans might fall because the pressure on a school principal and board in a deprived area <Col N="99" /> in formulating school plans will be far greater than in other areas where principals and boards do not have the same degree of crisis management, discipline problems and pressures on the existing school resources.  There will probably be a role for the Department, through its inspectorate, to help resource the thinking behind these plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have such a role.  Section 21(2) sets out that a school plan will be prepared in accordance with various directions.  Much detail will be required in the drawing up of a school plan.  It is not appropriate that the Bill should spell out all that detail.  There is a covering point that the Minister will issue directions in terms of the nature and quality of the interaction at local level and the consultation process that must be engaged in between the partners in drawing up a school plan.  It is appropriate that we give national guidelines in this regard and directions in terms of the basic principles that should be involved as to how partners should be made part of the process.  The inspectorate will have an important role in advising schools on this.  I envisage the inspectorate as being central to the regulations that will follow the passing of the Bill and the directions that will issue relating to the school plan.</P>

      <P>I will not press my amendment, but I am not clear about how the Minister perceives school plans will be developed in schools which by their nature will not have access to the same expertise that will be available to other schools.  The Minister will need to do more than issue guidelines to schools.  He will have to ensure inspectors act as advocates and work with the school to develop a credible school plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is part of the school evaluation exercise.  I would see the inspectorate playing a support role in assisting schools, particularly smaller schools, on the methodology of this and the best way to develop such plans.  There may also be other supports we can give schools.</P>

      <P>It is a board's responsibility to produce a school plan.  The principal teacher and/or some other teachers will produce the plan.</P>
      <P>There would probably be a lot of merit in using the teacher centres to discuss the formatting of these plans.  Where there have been school plans in my area the inspector would have played an ongoing role in their development.  The onus would be on the school to produce the plan, but adaptations or amendments would be made within the context of those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The partners in education and what they wish to have in the school plan would play a role, but not everything can be included.  Perhaps because I am a teacher I believe the teacher, especially the principal teacher, will have the main responsibility <Col N="100" /> for developing the plan.  This should cover Deputy Bruton's concerns.  The Department needs to be proactive.  The teacher centres would be a useful vehicle for developing this strategy.</P>

      <P>This was discussed on Committee Stage.  Our discussions of amendments Nos. 124 and 126 dealt with one aspect of the matter.  We have gone to considerable effort to set out the functions of the school and the objectives of the education system.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I was concerned at the extent to which schools would look at these objectives and bear them in mind.  I saw merit in asking schools in the preparation of their plans to look at the objectives and the functions of the school set out in the Bill.  These articulate the detail we have been adding in the context of the discussion on the school plan and issues such as equality of treatment and others set out in section 6 and other sections.  It may be a good idea if part of the information pack to be sent to schools as they frame their plans contain the objectives set out in the Bill, which they should look at because they are the touchstones set by the Oireachtas as to what the school system is about.</P>

Should the section not read: &ldquo;.  ..and shall contribute to the education and personal development of students in that school.&rdquo;?  I am not sure if the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; adds anything, indeed, it could have a diluting effect.

      <P>In page 21, line 38, after &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and so agreed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Part V is concerned with the principal and teachers.  Section 23 is concerned with the principal. Section 23(1) states: &ldquo;A board shall, in accordance with procedures agreed from time to time between the Minister, the patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers, appoint to the school in a whole-time capacity a person to be Principal of that school subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; When the consultation process set out in the section is at an end the decision should be made by way of agreement, especially with the recognised trade union or staff organisation.  This practise has generally been adhered to in the past in the area of industrial relations.  I fear that if the agreement was not part of it, at a particular time some agreement could be reached that could prove divisive rather than constructive in terms of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be divisive in the sense <Col N="102" /> that in the public interest the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance have responsibility to determine how public funds are utilised.  The determination of terms and conditions of employment is a standard element of all similar legislation.  Obviously this Bill is not the forum for this issue.  The normal industrial relations machinery and agreements between Government and social partners hammered out in regular social partnerships will determine pay levels and allowances.  That is why the clause will always be in the legislation, even though what happens in terms of the ongoing relationship between the social partners and Government in practice determines what happens to pay levels and allowances.  This is a standard provision we are incorporating in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 21, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall consult with national associations in relation to these procedures in a timely manner to ensure that due account is taken of the concern of parents in their design.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the consultation of parents in respect of the procedures for appointing school principals.  It is noticeable that section 23 describes that procedures will be agreed with the patron, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions or staff associations representing teachers on the procedure of appointing a person to be a principal. The noticeable absentees from the list of partners in the school are parents.  The Minister should consult national associations on these procedures in a timely manner to ensure that due account is taken of the concerns of parents in their design.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the appointment of the principal and the way in which such appointments are made, are of fundamental importance to the quality of the education provided in school.  The parents, who under the Constitution are recognised as the primary educators of the child, must surely have some role in being consulted on the procedures for these appointments which are so important to the quality of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand that issues of industrial relations and employment conditions are involved, where parents do not have a specific role, unlike a management organisation or a trade union.  I would not suggest that parents should be included on the same footing as those <Col N="103" /> who have traditionally negotiated collective agreements but some of these procedures are of significant importance to parents.  What happens if a principal is hopeless and what procedures exist for dealing with such a problem?  There are numerous broader issues that parents could have a legitimate input into and concern about.  In framing legislation about the appointment of someone, whom we all recognise is the leader of the school and without whom all of this very worthy framework will not function, there is merit in recognising a consultative role for parents in respect of some elements of all the procedures of appointment and/or removal, if that became an issue.  That is why I suggest the Minister should recognise that parents have a role in respect of other areas, while not recognising them as one would recognise a trade union in negotiations because some issues do not fall within their remit.</P>

      <P>To a certain extent the Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  Sensitive industrial relations issues are at stake.  I do not want to change the <i>status quo</i>, unilaterally.  The best way forward is for all the partners to agree to try to develop a consensus on the matter.  At the moment, quite clearly, the appointment of a principal represents a contract between the person concerned and the school board of management. I point out again that parents are on boards of management and will clearly have an input into the appointment of the principal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I have formulated it in a very loose way.  All I am asking is that the Minister should consult the national associations on the procedures, in a timely manner.  I am not saying parents have a right of veto in these procedures, nor am I saying the Minister must act on their recommendations.  At the very minimum, however, in passing legislation that is setting the framework not just for today but perhaps for 20 years hence &mdash; the Minister will probably feel he <Col N="104" /> would not want to go through this process again for 100 years &mdash; we should not just be influenced by the current climate of industrial relations.  If the climate of industrial relations is as the Minister describes it, it says more about a rather distorted view of the role of parents in the education system.  These procedures will inevitably come under scrutiny in future and there will be more and more interest in the quality of education. There will be more and more focus on incompetence wherever it arises, and how it is dealt with. To say that parents would not have some role that is specified in legislation &mdash; it is not a prescriptive or vetoing role &mdash; speaks volumes about the nature of the problems we have in recognising partnership in education.</P>
      <P>There is far too much protectiveness within the education system about throwing open the doors. Parents are not out on the ramparts trying to break down the system, they are trying to make it work.  I would far prefer to see a bit more openness and generosity on all sides rather than have people sitting in tight positions saying, &ldquo;This is my territory, don't dare come in on it&rdquo;.  That is what the Minister is saying.  Such territorial demarcations are set out and he does not want to shake the tree or rattle the cage.  I am of the opposite view; that something like this could not be construed as being offensive.  However, at the same time it would open up the doors so that at least parents can peep in and express a view to the Minister who is their representative.  He is the people's representative in all this, which is a good thing.  I respect the Minister's practical difficulties but, on reflection, I do not think this matter would be seen as offensive to modern trade union leaders or school managements.  If it is, it would be disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the pay and conditions of principal teachers.  As the Minister pointed out, there has been a traditional method of dealing with those.  The input of parents into the consultation process is not quite the same as parents being involved in an agreement process. Nobody, including teachers, would stand over incompetence or dereliction of duty on the part of a teacher.  However, there is always the danger of malice, of individuals looking for a stick with which to beat somebody.  Deputy Bruton was concerned about over-protectiveness in this area, but there is much wisdom in not exposing certain areas in a way that is not conducive to obtaining the best results.  Incompetence and dereliction of duty can be dealt with effectively between the Department and the teacher unions.  As a teacher I would not want to teach in a school where the principal was not functioning because in such circumstances there would be all sorts of spin-offs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process includes people who traditionally have had responsibility for determining the pay and conditions of principals, and I would be loath to change that.  On the other hand, I agree with Deputy Bruton that nobody would stand over incompetence or dereliction of duty <Col N="105" /> on the part of a principal.  The procedures for dealing with such situations should be addressed by the Department.  One of the difficulties is that the qualification for national teaching does not qualify a person to do anything else.  If somebody is not suited, for whatever reason, to the job of teaching, a solution might be reached by moving the person into some other employment within the State service.  Much of the difficulty in dealing with incompetence is in finding an alternative occupation for somebody who has devoted part of his or her life to an education which focuses him or her in a particular direction.  It is not an easy question, but it needs to be effectively addressed where it arises because, at the end of the day, the interests of children are paramount. Any other interest has to take second place in that regard.</P>
    <P>The only example Deputy Bruton gave was the input national parents' organisations might have in this regard.  The kinds of concerns Deputy Bruton has stated come in at other levels but, in the final analysis, this is essentially an industrial relations area where there are set practices and standards.  It is difficult enough to bring about change in the education system and something like this could have the effect of delaying progress. The issue about which Deputy Bruton has expressed particular concern could and should be addressed in other ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Shea.  We will bring forward a teaching council Bill in the new year.  I established a steering committee and a working group some time ago which produced a comprehensive report on a teaching council which involves issues of professionalism and standards and deals with the full gamut of issues pertaining to teacher competence and so forth.  Parents and all Departments have worked on the steering committee in particular and have been party to the preparation of a teaching council Bill which will be a significant achievement if we can pull it off.  I am confident we will.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment does not really deal with the issue of incompetence or the removal of teachers; it deals specifically with the procedures for the appointment of teachers and consultation with national parents' councils.  It is my judgment that at this time it would be inappropriate to unilaterally put that into legislation. To do so would jeopardise the balance that exists and it would have a significant negative effect on industrial relations which is not warranted at this time.  The best way to proceed is to try to develop agreement and consensus between the partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I still say the Minister is selling us short on this.  I can understand Deputy O'Shea's reservations.  These are difficult problems, but parents have a right to be heard, and not just on incompetence.  Parents would probably articulate the view that in schools in areas where there is serious disadvantage a school principal or any staff member appointed should have <Col N="106" /> experience in dealing with the problems of such schools, and we should not appoint people without the relevant experience.</P>
      <P>There are many areas where parents might bring an insight that is not strictly reflected by national managements or national union associations. That is in the nature of things.  One does not expect the representatives of trade unions or of management to necessarily articulate the views of another group.  It would be inhuman to expect them to do that.  That is why some move in this direction is worthwhile.  The Minister may say there will be consultation only in relation to appointments, but if there is some consultation in relation to the appointment of teachers, the other side of that is the removal of a teacher.  If parents are brought in they will have the chance to say something about the sort of criteria that should apply in the appointment of principals to different types of schools, whether they are happy with how appointment procedures are working and so on.  Parents will bring a new perspective which will be valuable.  The Minister is the only representative of the public in this.  He is the people's champion and he should hear the views of parents, particularly where they are not going to be included under the statute.  I am only asking that parents would at least have the ear of the Minister in relation to their concerns and have it statutorily. I do not propose to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 143, 144 and 145 are aimed at addressing issues concerned with the establishment of student councils.  This was discussed on Committee Stage and the amendments, which arise from the concerns expressed, place more emphasis on the autonomy of students in establishing councils and give the Minister a role in setting guidelines for the establishment, election and dissolution of councils.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea's amendment proposes to change the word &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; to &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;.  I am not sure that is appropriate because schools are different in size and ethos.  I do not believe they should be tied down by ministerial regulation on a matter such as this.  Guidelines are more flexible, allow for some degree of local autonomy and are more appropriate.  If the situation does not work out, under section 33 the Minister is not prevented from issuing regulations on this matter.  If at some future date it is necessary to do so, the Minister is empowered under the Bill to issue regulations pertaining to student councils.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 148a:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.  -(1) Where a board makes a decision which materially affects the education of a student and a dispute arises in relation thereto and internal procedures are exhausted, either party to the dispute may apply to the Secretary General who may appoint an independent person to attempt conciliation and to afford a hearing to both sides.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment arising from discussions on Committee Stage.  A further course of redress beyond the grievance procedures within schools is the appeals procedure to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  I suggest that, where all grievance procedures within a school have been exhausted and before the formal appeals procedure is resorted to, conciliation should be attempted as another option. The amendment provides that either party may apply to the Secretary General who may appoint an independent person to attempt conciliation and to afford a hearing to both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a certain difficulty arises which causes pain for a student, their family and possibly the school, it is important that a person without affiliation with the school or the education system be appointed to listen to both sides and seek to arrive at an agreed solution rather than allowing the matter of dispute, such as a suspension, an expulsion or a decision not to admit a child on grounds other than lack of accommodation, go through the appeals procedure.  The formal and more remote appeals procedure, which by its nature is arbitrary, can be more intimidating for those who are not used to presenting themselves in a formal setting.  If they could go down the other avenue, they would have an opportunity to reflect on the position in which they find themselves with a neutral third party who would seek <Col N="110" /> to reach a fair conclusion.  The Minister should give this proposal some consideration.</P>
    <P>When the new appeals procedure is introduced it is inevitable that a large number of appeals will be lodged but the numbers will probably level off in time.  We would do all involved in the education system a service by ensuring solutions are found locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 148a and 151.  The Bill provides for a comprehensive appeals procedure which involves appeals to the Secretary General of the Department and the establishment of an appeals committee.  This matter was thrashed out at some length on Second and Committee Stages and I am satisfied the correct balance has been struck.  Flexibility has also been provided for.  Following consultation with the partners in education, the Minister will have the power to develop the process further.</P>

In cases where a solution has not been found it should be indicated to both parties that either of them can apply to the Secretary General of the Department to have a conciliation procedure initiated.  The decision on whether such a procedure would be effective should rest with the Secretary General. Parents are not used to presenting themselves at various fora and they may feel the system is not responsive to their needs and that they are being excluded.  Where they have a grievance it is important that there is quick access to conciliation. <Col N="111" /> I have been involved in the conciliation process and it is important to listen to both sides who should be allowed to talk at length.

      <P>This amendment deals with the question of whether an internal process of investigation would have to be gone through before an appeal could be made.  As the legislation is framed, permanent exclusion and suspension would have to go through a process of internal appeal before it could be brought to the attention of the appeals service of the Department.  In the case of exclusion from the school, which is a dramatic change in a pupil's status, some form of fast track appeals procedure should be available.  To require a student who has been permanently excluded from school to await the deliberations of an internal process of indeterminate length does not seem fair.  In view of the gravity of the decision to exclude or suspend there should be direct access to the appeals procedure.  My amendment would ensure only the new class (d) of complaints and grievances would go through the internal school appeals procedure.</P>

      <P>There are four categories of complaint.  Classes (a), (b) and (c) deal with exclusions and suspensions.  If a child is excluded from school following a decision in one of those three categories the child's appeal should go directly to the Department's appeals procedure rather than wait an indeterminate length while the school considers it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

Category (a) refers to students permanently excluded from school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will lay down procedural regulations when the Bill has become law. An appeal to the Secretary General could take even longer than an internal appeal.  I would be concerned about delays if the Secretary General received hundreds of such appeals.  Ideally, we <Col N="113" /> would like to resolve as many problems as possible locally.  I do not propose to accept this amendment although the Deputy's point is valid. The regulations issued by the Minister will take cognisance of the fact that students cannot be kept waiting for three months while excluded from school.  It would be my intention that departmental regulations would deal with that situation. A timeframe for such appeals and for decisions on those appeals would be laid down.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Pensions for the Self-Employed: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on Tuesday, 3 November 1998: <Col N="114" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those who were 56 years or over when social insurance pension contributions for the self-employed were introduced in April 1988, and who were required to make contributions but are now precluded from eligibility for the contributory old age pensions which became payable from 6 April 1998.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension and in that context welcomes the decision already taken by the Government to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> old age (contributory) pension for those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988 and notes that the issue will be addressed in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss pension provisions.  It seems the key element of the motion has been accepted by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I commend him for that.  It is important that when political parties seek a mandate from the public to maximise their seats by making major promises, such as were given in the partly fictional document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, they should keep them.</P>
      <P>The introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for self-employed people who had contributed to the social insurance fund for almost ten years but who had missed the deadline by a few weeks is praiseworthy.  Deputy Moynihan-Cronin outlined many tragic cases where people missed the opportunity to qualify by one or two weeks. While the Department issued a refund, the capital sum was tiny compared to the security which could have been given to people if this measure had been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, of which the Progressive Democrats is a member, seems to have had second thoughts about the social insurance fund. When in Opposition, they, particularly one member who is now outside the House, ranted and raved at the Labour Party which was in Government about abolishing that fund.  They did not seem to have thought the issue through.  The only alternative was to ask people to make their own <Col N="115" /> pension provisions.  The Progressive Democrats' suggestion to abolish the social insurance fund was ludicrous.  I am glad the Minister resisted that idea.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's great responsibilities is to ensure that the country comes to grips with the pension time bomb.  The excellent report by the Irish Pensions Board, entitled &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;, gave much food for thought.  It made it clear that we must make a big effort to encourage younger people to provide for their pensions through some of the mechanisms mentioned in the report, such as the personal retirement savings account.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government has finalised its Estimates and in four weeks time we will debate the budget.  I hope the Government does not adopt a niggardly, right-wing approach to public sector spending in areas such as housing, education and health or to those who depend on social welfare.  It should be called on to meet the target set out in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to raise basic non-contributory pensions to £100 a week as quickly as possible rather than over a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>I was happy to be closely involved in the various movements for senior citizens in the last Dáil.  I took it upon myself to organise an informal all-party group of Deputies who pursued the key issues for our senior citizens.  On a number of occasions, we attended meetings of the former Committee on Finance and General Affairs and other committees of the Dáil.  We raised issues such as security, housing provision and <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  I hope the Minister will attempt to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>When we talk to members of the seniors parliament and SIPTU's senior group, we hear the same bitter complaints about increasing numbers of senior citizens without adequate housing who feel desperately insecure in deprived areas.  Many of them depend on a miserly income, particularly if they are self-employed and have small savings. Many may have to pay significant amounts of tax while others could lose most of their contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Fine Gael Party for tabling this motion, which is timely, and the Government for accepting it.  I hope the Government remedies this unfair situation in next month's budget.</P>
    <P>We have reflected on the situation for the self-employed in recent weeks.  Last week the farming community marched through the city.  As a city representative, I welcome the farmers' attempt to state their case firmly.  As a successor of Jim Larkin and the trade union movement, I believe it is our basic right to walk anywhere in Ireland or in this city.  The farmers have the same right to make their case.</P>

      <P>I read a recent extract about the life of the Deputy's brother and I noted that although he lived in Drumcondra, he was familiar with milking cows and various other agricultural tasks.  I come from County Dublin where there is also a strong farming tradition, although it is a farm labour tradition.</P>
      <P>It is critical for the self-employed and the farming community that we organise a pensions programme which will support them in their later years so that they will not be left in poverty. People who have contributed to our economy for four or five decades should not be left in dire financial circumstances.  As Deputies, we meet some of those people every week in our clinics.</P>
      <P>I hope to introduce a paper in the near future on the back to work scheme, which will help unemployed people to become self-employed. The Minister is not prepared to properly fund this area.  If we want unemployed people to become self-employed, we must provide resources.  I might be able to make some suggestions to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Yes, but speaking as a director of a small business centre, we do not think the Minister is giving us enough support.  I welcome the Minister's decision to remedy this unfair provision and I ask him to look again at the 1961 ten year rule as regards the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Noel Ahern, Healy-Rae, Carey and Michael Kitt.  I am delighted to speak in support of this amendment.  As the Minister said last night, this motion is a non-event.  Deputy O'Keeffe is abusing the House in tabling a motion when the Minister has already indicated the issue has been resolved.  However, it gives us an opportunity to welcome this important measure and to point out that Fianna Fáil in Government is delivering on its commitments and to point to the abject failure of Fine Gael, <Col N="117" /> Labour and the Democratic Left to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>In the Fianna Fáil position paper &ldquo;Irish Families in the New Millennium&rdquo;, we gave a commitment to make new arrangements to tackle the problems faced by those who are marginally excluded from participation in PRSI pensions. This is an important issue for many self-employed people who are often not in good financial circumstances and who honestly paid their contributions when they were included in the system from 1988.  However, when they came to pension age they were horrified to find they did not qualify for a pension if they were over 56 years in 1958.  Many people missed out by a few weeks or days.</P>
      <P>There must be rules, but there must also be exceptions to the rules when they create unfair anomalies.  It is unfair that people should lose out on a pension through no fault of their own when they have paid their contributions in good faith. During the tenure of the last Administration, Deputies Walsh and Woods raised this issue on numerous occasions.  Where was Deputy O'Keeffe then?  What did the Rainbow Coalition do about this?  It copperfastened the discriminatory ten year rule and allowed for a repayment of part of the contributions paid, which amounted to £900 on average.  What use is this to a farmer or a self-employed person when what they need is a pension?</P>
      <P>Many groups have raised this issue with us and I and my colleagues have in turn raised it with the Minister on many occasions.  He has always given this issue a fair hearing and has indicated his desire to bring it to a favourable conclusion. Farming organisations recently made a case for <i>pro rata</i> pensions, to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and the social affairs committee.  We all know farmers are going through a bad patch. They made a strong case for the extension of the <i>pro rata</i> pension to the self-employed as part of the Government's response to this issue.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister last night confirmed the indication he gave last month that the <i>pro rata</i> pension will be paid to everyone who has paid at least five years' contributions from 1988. This is a fair approach to the issue which will be acceptable to the groups who have campaigned for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition must be hard up for something to say if they tabled this motion.  The issue has already been decided &mdash;<i>pro rata</i> pensions will be paid.  All this motion does is to highlight the fact that Fianna Fáil is delivering on the commitments it made at election time.  It also highlights the fact that Fine Gael and Labour in Government did nothing about this issue.  Now they are in Opposition they promise everything.  I am disappointed with the attitude of Fine Gael who seem to have a split personality.  Fine Gael in Government does not do anything for anybody and Fine Gael in Opposition promises everything to everybody. When the Labour Party is in Government, nothing is ever their fault and they always want <Col N="118" /> to do the right thing.  However, they cannot fool the voters.</P>
    <P>The self-employed who will benefit from this measure know that Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left were in Government for three budgets and did nothing.  They know that before our second budget, Fianna Fáil and our colleagues in Government have delivered on our commitments.  We will look after the elderly in every part of this country and in every section of society.  This is just one measure in the package of measures to support our elderly in line with our commitments in the action programme.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Wade.  It is strange that this motion is being tabled when a decision has been made by the Minister.  I would have thought the Opposition would use their Private Members' time more fruitfully to bring forward more pressing issues.  However, I know Deputy O'Keeffe was more successfully busy in recent weeks so perhaps he was not kept fully informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody could have suggested other good causes that Fine Gael could have raised in their Private Members' time.  I am glad the Minister is bringing this measure forward which delivers on a commitment we gave at the last election.  The issue has been discussed on numerous occasions in the House when different parties received the Civil Service reply from whoever was in Government at the time.  It is good that the Minister has cleared the logjam and will deliver on our promise in the budget.</P>
      <P>The present contributory pension system is rather strange.  Some people do well from it while others do badly.  One comes across many cases where a couple of extra stamps would give somebody ten pounds or £15 more per week.  The way in which the system is banded works in favour of some people and against others.  Obviously if a change is made there will be winners and losers, which it is hard to face up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the sacred ten year rule is being breached to some extent.  One could say there is an argument for giving <i>pro rata</i> pensions to those who have paid one year's contribution or more.  When the Minister introduces this change, those who have paid just under five years' contributions will probably attack him and his successors. These decisions hold an issue at bay for a while.  It is good to see the Government, with the UN Year of Older People approaching, making these decisions and following through on the <Col N="119" /> increases given to pensioners in last year's budget which I hope will be repeated next month.</P>
    <P>Given that the economy is doing so well, any benefits should be given to the elderly who helped to put the framework in place.  In many cases they do not have large pressure or lobby groups acting on their behalf.  The self-employed are represented by groups who took up their cause.  However, the elderly are not and we should be fair minded enough to look after them.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in pension schemes. While I am glad this one has been solved, there is a greater injustice with which I hope the Minister will deal as soon as possible.  This is the case of the pre-1953 stamps.  There are a great number of elderly people who worked in the 1940s and are now well into their 70s or 80s.  They feel aggrieved that the stamps they paid in the 1940s are not taken into account for a contributory old age pension.  This is a great injustice although there is the technical consideration that the stamps they paid did not cover a pension contribution. However, when the new scheme was introduced those stamps were given full status for 20 years.  It is ridiculous to say 20 years later that a stamp paid in the 1940s was not a full one.</P>
    <P>We have all come across people who worked in the 1940s and became self-employed or emigrated in 1955-7 because of the recession.  They may have started paying stamps as self-employed people in 1988.  However, they are penalised for making contributions in the 1940s and 1950s rather than receiving credit for them like those who only started paying contributions in 1988. The Department should do an in-depth analysis of the cost of giving credit for stamps prior to 1953.  It is a grave injustice and the cost would be no greater than that of this measure announced by the Minister.  No lobby group is acting on behalf of these people but the move is needed and just.  Now that the Minister has grappled with one of these long-term problems I hope he finds the courage, time and money to tackle another one, and brings forward good news in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's proposals on pensions for the self-employed.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs I was asked to report on this subject so it is appropriate that I say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the preparation of the report I found that few self-employed people had taken out pension cover.  There were a number of reasons for this and we should tackle them in debating this <i>pro rata</i> scheme.  There was a lack of education among the self-employed on the need to provide for old age.  Pensions were perceived as a sales product of the insurance industry or a means of avoiding tax.  Pensions provided by the insurance industry have a poor image.  There was a lack of transparency about the costs and benefits of the product, high pressure sales techniques, often <Col N="120" /> with commission or target-oriented sales teams, particularly those from banks, often did not provide correct advice, the initial set up costs of the product were high and there was a lack of flexibility.</P>
    <P>There were reasons for many of these drawbacks. Pension products for the self-employed are generally contribution-oriented and lack forward planning for the funding necessary for retirement income.  An annuity payout system for pensions often provides only a fixed income for the remainder of life.  This is unsuitable because the cost of living increases, as does the need to provide for home and health care.  It was also noted that increasing lifespan and demographic trends require forward planning at Government level to ensure people become more responsible in providing for their retirement years.  An increased retirement age, on a voluntary basis, should also be considered.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for more flexible pension product alternatives, such as secure savings or investment schemes, which will assist people in providing for their retirement.  Long-term capital investment projects could be financed using pension savings.  These products could be secured by Government bonds and made available to pension savers.  Tax breaks for pension planning should be increased as people get older.  The current restrictions of 15 per cent and 20 per cent are too low for people who start saving for pensions late in life.  There should be a limit on the amount of pension contributions qualifying for tax relief, as they are currently being used for tax avoidance schemes.  Lower cost and more transparent and flexible pension products are needed from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The Government should provide an information programme to increase people's awareness of the need to provide for retirement.  There is also a need for insurance products which provide for health and home care costs in later life, as these can put a considerable strain on older people's savings.  Pension planning in small businesses is critical, as many of them cannot support two families.</P>
    <P>We should assist and encourage pension planning for the self-employed.  There should be ongoing Government information campaigns on the need to plan for retirement and the level of savings required to provide a pension.  We need new insurance and pension products which meet the requirements of people in their old age, such as a pension which would provide for increases in the cost of living or insurance products for health care in old age.  The pension industry needs to provide low-cost and easily understandable pension options.  The Government needs long-term planning on the consequences for society if self-employed people are not providing enough for retirement.  PRSI contributions could be increased to fund retirement costs.  I am pleased the Minister has honoured his commitment and whole-heartedly congratulate him.</P>

      <P>What is this vote about tonight?  Is it a proposal to stop this pension being introduced?  The Minister has made his announcement.  I compliment him on giving me a hearing a year and a half ago, and I have the paper to prove I am genuine.  This matter touches many small farmers.  I received deputations in Killorglin and Killarney from the hills and the byways, asking me to do something about these pensions.  Whether it was the Minister or I who did this, I compliment him on what he did.  I come from the worst farming areas in the country and I am glad the Minister is assisting people from those places in this scheme.</P>
      <P>If there is one thing that annoys me, it is listening to people in this House talking about <i>pro rata</i> pensions when they did nothing about the problem despite having plenty of chances.  It is worse to hear people talking about small farmers &mdash; if they were put on some of the farms on which people are trying to survive, they would die from hunger before St. Stephen's Day.  I thank the Minister for this scheme.  He will be remembered by me and by the people I represent in Kerry as one of the best Ministers in the Department.</P>

      <P>Previous speakers mentioned that 1999 has been declared the United Nations International Year for Older Persons.  In his contribution the Minister said it is a mark of a progressive society, the way it treats its senior citizens. Many Members will have had an opportunity of reading the comprehensive pre-budget submission by the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament.  I compliment people like Paddy Donegan, Michael O'Halloran and Eddie Fitzgerald in my constituency for the work they have done on that document.  In their submission they advert to issues such as those the Minister has addressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Ahern, also raised the issue of pre-1953 contributions.  It is almost a question of social justice that we are seen to address this problem.  For some reason, possibly because the system was less targeted in those days, people now find themselves in an anomalous position in that they cannot benefit from what they believe were genuine contributions.</P>
      <P>I welcome that up to 8,000 people will benefit from the free schemes.  That will make a great difference to their quality of life in terms of the fuel allowance, free electricity and gas, etc.  I compliment the Minister on that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of private pensions will become very important in the years ahead as our ageing population increases.  The main point to note in relation to private pension provision for the self-employed is that they are currently restricted to the benefits secured by a contribution rate of 15 per cent of net relative earnings or 20 per cent for those over the age of 55.  By comparison, PAYE employees who are members of occupational pension schemes may be provided with benefits at retirement which leave them in a much better position because the only restriction on premiums is whatever it costs to fund the benefits.  For example, to fund for revenue maximum approval benefits at a retirement age of 65 for a married male of 45 years of age would require a contribution rate of over 40 per cent of annual earnings. By definition, therefore, the benefits which would emerge for a self-employed individual of the same age would be significantly lower because of the restricted level of contributions allowable for tax relief purposes.  The national pensions report <Col N="123" /> has addressed this anomaly to some degree but the proposed personal retirement savings accounts will continue to have an upper limit for tax relief purposes of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of the provisions for the self-employed is that there is no allowance for retrospection whereas PAYE employees with a minimum of ten years' pensionable service may be augmented by the revenue maximum.  Indeed employees at the point of retirement can make personal contributions of up to 15 per cent of aggregate earnings to augment their entitlements within revenue limits and claim retrospective income tax relief for up to ten years.</P>
    <P>While this country will not face the same difficulties that will be encountered by other EU member states in relation to State pension provision, we will nevertheless incur a 50 per cent increase in the numbers qualifying for State pensions over the next 30 years.  This will inevitably give rise to a much higher cost to the State to maintain and improve the level of State retirement pensions in line with Government policy. Generous tax incentives are available to encourage private pension provision.  Perhaps the treatment of the self-employed in this regard could be brought more in line with the treatment of PAYE employees.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the pre-1953 contributions issue.  If he manages to do that in the lifetime of this Government like Deputy Healy-Rae, I will say he is the best Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs we have had in a long time.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome his proposals for <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for the self-employed which will benefit farmers and small business people in my constituency as well as those in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988.  I am delighted the matter has been addressed by the Minister and that he will provide more details in the forthcoming budget. We are all aware of the hundreds of people, mostly farmers in my constituency, who lost out by mere days, weeks or months on a contributory pension.  Suggestions have been made in regard to allowing that group to pay additional contributions or a lump sum.  There was even a suggestion that people who reached the age of 66 might be allowed to continue making contributions until they have sufficient to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of contributory pensions has been a major issue with the farming organisations.  It has been discussed at every Fianna Fáil agricultural conference I have attended and I welcome the Minister's commitment to address it now, particularly his commitment to the elderly.  The Minister referred to changes in the budget and helping people to get the £100 pension by the <Col N="124" /> year 2002, but I would like him to consider the question of a contributory pension for carers, who do very important work, and move towards abolishing the means test for the carer's allowance for those who give continual care.</P>
    <P>The elderly have been well supported by the Minister and the Government.  I ask the Minister to consider the position of those who made contributions before 1953, which is regarded as the base year.  These people are now elderly and have lost out in terms of a pension.  I would also like to see <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for widows and widowers, many of whom are short of contributions to qualify for pensions.  The Minister provided for a £5 increase in the old age pension in the last budget bringing it up to a basic rate of £83 per week.</P>
    <P>In considering a response to the question of contributory pensions, the previous Government suggested a refund of the pensions element of the self-employed contributions.  This amounted on average to approximately £900 which is a small amount for people seeking pensions.  Will the Minister consider the position of people who got refunds with a view to allowing them a <i>pro-rata</i> pension?</P>
    <P>A letter I received in recent days from a small businessman states:</P>
    <P>As an employer I paid PRSI for 7 years for myself, and got no pension at the time of my retirement.</P>
    <P>I was making a compulsory contribution.  At the end of the term I was refunded 53% of my contributions, without interest.</P>
    <P>I believe that I am entitled to 7/10 of my pension as it was compulsory.  As a result, at the age of 70 I am still working to live and survive.</P>
    <P>Is this the way employers are to be treated, after employing staff for years, paying their contributions as well as my own.  At retirement age to be told that I was refused a pension, while my employees are entitled to theirs. Surely this is an injustice or discrimination.</P>
    <P>That man has put forward the case very well and I am glad the Minister has addressed the issue of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions.</P>
    <P>We are in Government with the Progressive Democrats.  We made this commitment in Opposition and we are delivering on our programme. The Minister proposes a <i>pro-rata</i> pension for those who have at least five years contributions paid since April 1988.  Up to 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults will benefit.  Some people may lose out but the Minister said the question of additional voluntary contributions will be addressed in the pensions Bill to be published next year.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and I have no doubt he will be regarded as one of the finest Ministers for Social Welfare the country ever had.</P>

      <P>Tonight's debate is important in that we will approve <i>pro rata</i> pensions for our elderly citizens.  It is important to note that our elderly citizens made this country what it is.  Their contribution over the years has left us in the proud position we are now in and they have given us the economic surplus we hear about so often. It is their contribution to Irish life and society which has made this possible.  The very least we should do is reward them in their twilight years.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed last evening when a female Fianna Fáil Deputy described this debate as a waste of Dáil time.  It is absolutely disgraceful that a Deputy could refer to the approval of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for elderly citizens as a waste of time.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe who pioneered moves to bring about the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions since he became Fine Gael's spokesperson on social welfare following the last general election.  Time after time the Deputy tabled ordinary and priority questions on this issue.  The motion we are debating was laid before the House last April and it must not be forgotten that it was tabled following the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in respect of which Deputy O'Keeffe tabled an amendment to grant <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  How many of those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House who contributed to this debate spoke in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in favour of the granting of <i>pro rata</i> pensions?  What did they do when the time to vote arrived?  They voted against the proposal.</P>

      <P>Those Members made the same speeches this evening as they did in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill but they now state that they will vote in favour of the granting of <i>pro rata</i> pensions.</P>
      <P>We must commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for his work and persistence in this area which has brought about results.  As Deputy Michael Kitt stated, natural justice is being done.  In 1988, people were forced by this House to enter and make contributions to a pension system from which no returns were forthcoming.  I commend the Government for putting in place <i>pro rata</i> pensions for these people.  Justice is being done and it is about time this happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I await the Minister's announcement of the small print relating to this matter following the <Col N="126" /> budget.  It will be interesting to see the details that emerge.  When the small print becomes public, I hope we will not discover that restrictions and small loopholes will prevent deserving people who contributed to the scheme from benefiting from it.  I also hope that the people who communicated with Members &mdash; particularly the person who wrote to Deputy Kitt &mdash; will obtain a little sunshine, a little warmth and a small pension from the Government to help them in their twilight years.</P>

      <P>I join with colleagues in congratulating Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on tabling this motion.  Deputies on all sides are satisfied with the Minister's announcement in respect of sanctioning <i>pro rata</i> pensions for the self-employed, a development that is long overdue.  Many constituents who contacted Members about this matter expressed great anger and frustration that a system was put in place into which they could pay PRSI contributions but from which they obtained no benefits.  When the ten year rule was introduced in 1988 by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray McSharry, the Opposition pointed out that problems would arise.</P>
      <P>I intended to congratulate and give full credit to the Minister for implementing the <i>pro rata</i> pension scheme but having listened to Deputy Healy-Rae's contribution it is obvious that he must take the lion's share of the credit for his involvement in this matter.  It is apparent that the Minister did not listen to representations about this matter until Deputy Healy-Rae became a pivotal factor in terms of the Government's survival and, with Deputies Blaney and Fox, he exerted additional pressure to ensure that the Minister was reminded about his obligations.  I acknowledge the Deputy's major contribution in this respect.  I am sure the Minister will state that <i>pro rata</i> pensions would not have been granted if it had not been for Deputy Healy-Rae.</P>
      <P>Inadequate and inaccurate information relating to the cost of granting these pensions was issued in the past.  The Minister was one of those who highlighted the huge cost involved in implementing such a scheme.  If people consult the Dáil Official Report they will discover that at one stage it was estimated that it would cost £500 million to pay <i>pro rata</i> pensions to the 20,000 people who qualify under the scheme.  Grossly distorted figures are often plucked out of the air in order to ensure that a scheme is never implemented.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe consistently stated that the scheme would cost approximately £20 million and last evening the Minister stated it would only cost £18 million to fully implement the scheme.</P>
      <P>This is a good day for the self-employed.  It is also a good day for the Oireachtas because Members have come together to ensure that a <i>pro rata</i> pension scheme for the self-employed will be introduced.  I thank everyone involved, particularly Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for ensuring that this matter will be finally resolved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for persevering with this issue since he became party spokesman on social welfare.  When it seemed that there was no way forward for the people who have suffered as a result of the ten year anomaly, Deputy O'Keeffe kept their hopes up by means of continuous communication.  I thank him for the various items of correspondence he sent to constituents in counties Wicklow and Carlow.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I received letters from people pointing out the injustice of this matter and I could not provide answers.  I welcome the Government's commitment to address this matter in the forthcoming budget.  However, it was important that Deputy O'Keeffe proceeded with the motion so that the group which had been marginalised could see the tangible efforts made on their behalf.  This situation should never have been allowed to develop because much unnecessary stress has been caused.  I look forward to this problem being dealt with in the budget.  I hope the necessary measures will be implemented on budget day and that this group of excluded people will not be obliged to wait for the introduction of the Finance Bill before their anxiety comes to an end.  I remind Deputy Healy-Rae that he does not hold a monopoly on concerns about small farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this motion.  As already stated, it was tabled last April by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe following the debate on the Social Welfare Bill when the granting of <i>pro rata</i> pensions was refused.  I thank the Minister for making it clear that payment of these pensions will be part of the budget strategy.  As Deputy McGrath stated, I hope that red tape or the small print will not prevent people from obtaining payment.  A number of my friends from Clones visited the House last evening, several of whom paid contributions to the scheme for a number of years and have passed their 66th birthday. However, they will not obtain payment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position in respect of those who paid contributions for three or more years.</P>
      <P>The position regarding farmers and other business people are slightly different to those outlined by the Minister last evening.  He stated that this change would encourage them to transfer ownership of their land.  If anything, the introduction of the <i>pro rata</i> pension will mean that fewer people will transfer ownership of their lands and businesses. Therefore, we must work towards developing a method to encourage young farmers and business people to gain ownership of their property and businesses at an early stage if their presence in rural areas is to be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I congratulate the Minister on taking this step forward, he must recognise that further steps <Col N="128" /> are required.  I understand a discussion took place today between the farming organisations and the Minister for Finance regarding income support for farmers, which is very important.  The family income supplement should be available to farmers and self-employed persons.  The Minister said it would cost up to £80 million to solve that problem &mdash; an increase from £30 million to £80 million in a short time.  We could argue about this matter all night but I congratulate the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has put forward a supplementary estimate amounting to £91.5 million, a great deal more than the cost of FIS.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed listening to the support the Minister got this evening from our Independent colleague from Kerry, Deputy Healy-Rea. He said at an earlier meeting there was a need to introduce grants for the restoration of houses.  I agree with him on that.  I will watch him closely because he has claimed he is a wheel of the Government &mdash; he is one of the wheels of the car.  The Minister has a very important job and it would be a pity if one of the wheels falls off.  I will watch to ensure that Deputy Healy-Rea and his Independent colleagues deliver on what they promise.  When the other element of the Minister's portfolio, the family income supplement, has been delivered to farmers and the self-employed, we will give Deputy Healy-Rea the full credit he always seeks.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the senior citizens' organisation who put in a tremendous amount of work, the Irish Farmers' Association and other farm organisations which campaigned for this, the ICA and a former president &mdash; who is in the Visitors Gallery &mdash; who campaigned and all others who assisted.</P>
      <P>The <i>pro rata</i> pension will mean that in the last few years of their lives, people who worked extremely hard and were asked to pay PRSI but received nothing in return will be given the recognition they deserve.  All people must be treated equally.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Family, Community and Social Affairs this evening I was interested to hear an official from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs say that due to the closure of the Krups factory in Limerick people there will need special help from the Department.  That is an example of where the Department sees a need and reacts to it.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in farming and I hope the Minister's officials will react in the same way to that need.  The hardship involved is no different whether a factory closes down or a farmer loses income because of the failure of Government to produce it or because of weather conditions.  The Minister deserves credit in this case but we await delivery on the other issues.</P>

      <P>I compliment all the senior citizens who contributed not only to this scheme but to the State.  The self-employed did not seek assistance from the State.  When the scheme was introduced in 1988 by a Fianna Fáil Government, it was obvious it was not thought through to its conclusion. Tonight we are witnessing part of the conclusion.  The Government has decided to complete the job which was started in 1988.  If we have to spend five, ten or 30 minutes complimenting each other across the floor it is a sad day given that the people affected contributed the work of a lifetime to the State and are entitled to benefits, especially from schemes they paid into, and that the legislators made no plans for pensions.  We are throwing bouquets at each other and referring to the greatest Minister of all times.  This is a disgrace. Instead, let us compliment the self-employed who put their hearts into building up their businesses, their families and the State.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I welcome the Minister's decision and that our spokesman, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, decided to bring this in last April.  I listened to Government backbenchers getting into convulsions about hypocrisy and so on.  I remind all those backbenchers who were not Members when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare and when Deputy Healy-Rea thought the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="130" /> Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was a wonderful character in County Kerry, I had raised the matter with Deputy Woods.  I can claim with fair justification to be the first Deputy to suggest <i>pro rata</i> payments.  The former Minister, Deputy Woods, and I discussed the matter.  I understood his position at the time &mdash; there was not a great deal of funds and the advice was against it.  I am pleased I was ahead of the posse.  Although it took until now to introduce it, I congratulate the Minister and give him credit for it.  Given that the Government is claiming credit for great ideas since coming into office last year, it is time to let it know we were alive and well four years ago at least.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were to act on the following matter he would become a great Minister.  In March 1994 I put down a question to a former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, seeking an increase in the £5 fuel allowance to which he replied he would keep the matter under review.  In the forthcoming budget will the Minister ensure the £5 fuel voucher is increased to something worthwhile.  This will show he has concern for the aged.  Given the smile on his face I am sure he will increase it and that I can announce it in Carlow tomorrow.  This scheme must be reviewed.  The £5 fuel voucher which was introduced in 1988 has lost its value.  I met a man on the street the other day who asked if I knew about the price increase in briquettes.  The Minister should deal with the £5 fuel voucher.  Given that he referred to the old in his contribution I am free to mention it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased it has been recognised that the concept of a Bill which provided that people should pay into a pension fund only to find they would not qualify for a pension is wrong.  This will create difficulties for some people, but at least it has been recognised.  I claim some credit for highlighting this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe on introducing this motion, which proposes that the Government should introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension for those who were 56 years of age or over when the social insurance pension for the self-employed was introduced.  Deputy O'Keeffe has spearheaded a campaign to remedy this injustice over a number of years, as have many Deputies from all sides of the House.  I also congratulate the Minister on responding positively to Deputy O'Keeffe's initiative by recognising the unfair practice of people paying social insurance and then being denied benefit.  We await details of the scheme in the forthcoming budget.  It will be interesting to note the procedure that will be put in place to ensure the proposed scheme covers as many people as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current position a group of people who were disallowed a pension under the 1998 legislation were forced to contribute to the scheme without being entitled to any benefit. Like Deputy Browne and others, I have argued <Col N="131" /> for many years that the contributory old age pension scheme is unfair and unjust to people, including farmers and others who are self-employed, who paid partial contributions from the age of 56. During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1997 strong views were expressed on this side of the House on that matter.</P>
    <P>We have all met people who have paid contributions, but have not received benefits.  How often have we been asked if a person could make up the shortfall in his or her contributions?  We have all met people whose contributions have been one, two or three weeks short of the number that would entitle them to pensions.  It was blatantly unfair that such people were not entitled to contribute to a pension and I am pleased the Minister recognises the unfairness of that ten year rule.  It was not only unacceptable but an insult to tell people they could get a refund of their contributions.</P>
    <P>The State has a duty to recognise the work of the older generation in contributing to our relative success.  We have a duty to recognise the tangible contribution and sacrifices made by former generations.  Reports of a recent conference organised by Fr. Harry Bohan send clear messages that society has a duty to take care of those who are retired and elderly.  We must undertake that duty as a State and it should be carried out at local authority level, health board level and at community and family level.  If we do not do that, we will let down our old people.</P>
    <P>The proposal announced by the Minister will introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension for those who have paid at least five years' contributions since 1988. Entitlement to such a pension will also include access to free schemes.  I note refunds of PRSI contributions already paid will be recovered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Those moneys might be recovered by way of weekly contributions from the pensions that will be awarded to those people.</P>

      <P>In 1998 the social insurance net was extended to cover all the self-employed, but entitlement to a contributory old age pension was restricted to only those who had ten years' stamps before they reached the retirement age of 65 years.  I did not agree with that regulation in principle. I heard previous speakers state that the previous Government did very little to correct that position.  The previous Government was not in office during all of that time.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this matter should be investigated and dealt with once and for all.  I am disappointed with the manner in which the Minister is dealing with this matter.  A <i>pro rata</i> pension will be paid to a group of people who have paid five years' contributions since 1988.  Why has the Minister stipulated a cut-off date which discriminates against those who were compelled by law to pay contributions for a period of up to five years after 1988?  If they did not do so, they would have been brought before the courts and fined £3,000.  That is a point of information for Deputy Healy-Rae.  I am amazed the Minister is victimising that section of the community who had to pay contributions from 1988 to 1993 and who will not qualify for a pension under this re-arrangement. Why will he not give that category of people an equal opportunity to pay their contributions so they could benefit from a contributory pension?</P>
      <P>Is it a crime that those people were born five years too soon?  Did they have an option?  If my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, had known the proposed scheme would affect those people who are caught in this five year net, I am sure he would have expressed different views a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>When a similar scheme was introduced in Great Britain, the people affected were given an opportunity to pay extra contributions to enable them to qualify for pensions.  What was right in Great Britain should be right in this country. Given that this is the era of the Celtic tiger and we have a buoyant economy, surely the Minister will reconsider the matter and give those people, even if some have paid only 12 months' contributions, an opportunity to qualify for pensions. Why would the Minister want to discriminate against those few thousand people?  To do so would be penny pinching and the Minister should stop that.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he has done to date, but a job half done or badly done is not good enough.  To include those who have contributed up to five years' contributions, which they were compelled to pay by a law passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas would involve a cost of only an additional £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in the coming season of peace and goodwill, to open his heart, not be penny pinching and not to stumble at the last fence.  I ask him to reconsider.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, on his foresight in moving the motion and I ask the Minister to be Santa Claus to the people who have paid less than five years contributions.  I also ask him to be magnanimous as he approaches Christmas and <Col N="133" /> not to forget that section of the community that has been victimised for the sake of a few paltry pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for giving us the opportunity to outline the manner in which the Government has fulfilled its commitments to exclude self employed pensioners.  We on this side of the House are delighted that we have been able to deliver on our commitments to the people who matter, those who, through no fault of their own, were excluded from the right to a pension because of their date of birth.  In equity this is a fair and balanced approach to take.  We proposed this in Opposition, we promised it before the election and we are now delivering on it in Government.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised a number of questions as to how the pension will operate.  As the Minister has said, the full details, including the amount of the reduced pension and the starting date for the pension, will be announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day.  However, in his speech last night the Minister confirmed that the free schemes will be payable with a <i>pro rata</i> pension in accordance with the general rules.  In addition, I assure Deputies that those who would otherwise qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension but who have already claimed a refund of contributions will not be disqualified from the new <i>pro rata</i> pension.</P>
      <P>This is one in a range of measures which we have and will introduce to improve the position of older people in our society.  In our action programme we recognise that older people through their hard work and dedication have made this country what it is today.  We must make this a good country for our older people.</P>
      <P>In the action programme we gave a guarantee that we would increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by 2002.  We made a major step in this direction in our first budget. The Government has also published the report of the national pensions policy initiative which, for the first time, sets out a comprehensive plan for the future of our pensions.  This comprehensive report contains a number of recommendations, which include the development of strong first pillar social welfare pensions based on social insurance and significant improvements in occupational and personal pension cover aimed at increasing the number of people over the age of 30 at work with second pillar pension coverage of 70 per cent, compared to the less than favourable 50 per cent currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepted the main thrust of the report in principle and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the pensions board, are currently examining, via three working groups, a number of key recommendations from the report, including the proposal to pre-fund, at least in part, the future cost of social welfare pensions, the mechanisms put <Col N="134" /> forward for achieving additional second pillar coverage, the personal retiring savings account and the proposal to introduce more simple and flexible tax arrangements for pensions with a view to introducing appropriate legislation in all these areas.</P>
    <P>On the pre-funding issue, the pensions board pointed out that there would be significantly increased budgetary pressures in the new millennium. By 2046 there will be one pensioner for every two people at work compared to one for every five today.</P>

We either put aside something now when things are going well or we can wait until the pensions bill falls due and the demographics are much less favourable.  The Government looks forward to receiving the report of the working group as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On the question of pensions legislation, examining all the complex issues covered in such a comprehensive report will necessarily take time. However, the Minister intends to publish a new pensions Bill in the last quarter of 1999 with a view to enactment in 2000.  The Government intends to build a strong first tier contributory pension with coverage which is as close to universal as possible.  The extension to this group of self-employed people helps to achieve that objective. On this solid basis we will build a high level of second tier pension coverage through personal and occupational pensions.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that what has been announced has been welcomed on all sides of the House.  On behalf of the Minister I thank the many groups who have raised the issue with him and the many Deputies on this side of the House and elsewhere who made proposals on the issue.  Again on behalf of the Minister, I take this opportunity to thank the civil servants in the Department for their constructive approach to resolving the issues raised by this anomaly.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate.  I regret statements by some Members that we have been wasting Dáil time.  Such remarks are unfortunate because we are dealing with people whose pensions rights were not forthcoming through no fault of their own.  That has now been put right and I welcome the Government's conversion.  I will withhold my final verdict until I hear the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance. The pre-budget leaks have indicated sunshine one day and doom and gloom the next.  Today's <Col N="135" /> pre-emptive statement by the Minister was full of doom and gloom.  In view of this we do not know what to expect.  The Minister has not made up his mind so we cannot be sure of the Government position, despite the announcement by Deputy Healy-Rea that matters have been finalised.</P>
      <P>People are very worried about their pension rights.  The Minister needs to consider the whole issue of pensions.  I listened to an interesting discussion last night when it was indicated that falling interest rates, which are to be welcomed, are not accumulating the pension benefits people might expect when they retire.  Long ago small farmers, business people and other self-employed made savings.  However, these have no relevance to pension entitlements and these people have found that when they retire their savings are soon eroded.</P>
      <P>It is important that a structure is in place so that a growing ageing population can look forward to retirement incomes in peace and the rewards to which they are entitled, having worked diligently and hard and having handed over a State to others of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <P>I am happy there has been a significant breakthrough on this issue.  The Minister should be magnanimous and accept that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's continuing pressure was of immense importance in encouraging the Government to see the light on this issue.  People were compelled by law to make contributions, yet they were then denied their proper entitlements at a later date.  What occurred was unfair, unjust and inequitable.  At last there has been a recognition of what is right and proper, that people should be paid their lawful entitlements.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have achieved this.  We must await the measures announced in the budget.  Beyond the significant number of people in the Visitors' Gallery there are many who have been badly treated over recent years.  I hope that at last they will be paid their due entitlements.</P>

      <P>We are now in the final stages of a worthy campaign in which many fought the good fight.  Many people on all sides of the House, and many organisations outside the House, have been involved in this fight.  When the battle is over the tendency for anyone to grab the laurels is rather childish, to say the least.  On behalf of Fine Gael, I have been delighted to spearhead the campaign within the House since I became spokesperson on social welfare.  I do not think the campaign would have been successful were it not for the many organisations that were so actively involved.  Many of them are represented in the Public Gallery today.  I compliment them on the effort they put into this campaign. At the end of the day a just cause is always worth fighting for.  Although I am a lawyer, I see a wealth of difference between law and justice. This was not a question of law but of justice.  An injustice was done when this scheme was introduced <Col N="136" /> in 1988.  It was pointed out at the time that there was a lacuna in the Bill which would lead to injustice.  It was also pointed out that no transitional arrangements were made for those who were forced to pay contributions, but who could not benefit under the terms of the legislation.  All efforts to change the legislation at the time were turned down and that lacuna remained.  That was the position I found when I took over as Opposition spokesman on social affairs.  I was glad to have been involved in what I consider to be a very just and worthy campaign.  I was very glad from the point of view of the Opposition to be able to give it priority.</P>
      <P>The issue became even more acute from last April when the first pensions came on stream, and the first people who had their ten years paid and had attained the age of 66 after 6 April &mdash; not, by the way, the person who attained that age on 6 April and whose claim was shot down, but those who reached that age on 7 April &mdash; got their pensions.  The House will recall the many parliamentary questions and priority questions concerning this issue.  Indeed, an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill was tabled to try to get the issue dealt with.  That was what led to the tabling of this motion last April.  An effort has been made to suggest that this motion was tabled last week, but it was tabled in April.</P>

      <P>The principle has now been established and I am delighted to congratulate the Minister on having at long last accepted it.  I am rarely too critical, but the tone of the Minister's speech was quite ungracious, ungenerous and childish in many ways.  It was in marked contrast to the tone of the speech from my fellow Corkonian, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, which highlighted the broad picture. There were a number of inaccuracies in the <Col N="137" /> speech by the Minister, Deputy Ahern.  The refund arrangement was originally provided for when the scheme was introduced in 1988, but that is neither here nor there at this stage.</P>
      <P>I was also concerned during the campaign by the efforts to suggest that this <i>pro rata</i> scheme could not be introduced from the point of view of cost.  I still recall the references in the newspaper to the sum of £756 million which, it was alleged, would be necessary to fund this scheme. Scathing remarks were made about me at the very thought that I would urge the Government to spend that much money on such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Following that, I tabled a priority question on Tuesday, 10 March 1998 on the issue of the alleged sum of £756 million.  I asked the Minister whether he would accept my view that a <i>pro rata</i> scheme could be introduced for less than £20 million a year.  The response from the Minister was quite interesting.  He said:</P>
      <P>As I indicated recently during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill [when he turned down my amendment] the additional cost of paying an old age contributory pension to all this group would be of the order of £50 million per annum, capitalised at £475 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to talk about the right to a refund, saying:</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that any self-employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension, receives a refund of the pension element [53 per cent, if you please] of his or her PRSI contributions with interest, which is a fair arrangement.</P>

      <P>The full details have not been spelt out.  I want to mention three issues raised by the Self-employed Persons Association, which has fought such a worthy battle in this campaign. The association raised the issue of recompense for the years during which people had been denied a pension &mdash; four years for those who are now 70 years old.  The association also raised the question of those, mentioned by my colleague Deputy Sheehan, with less than five years' contributions. They are still, apparently, to be denied a pension because of their age.  Thirdly, the association questioned the Minister's estimate of the total cost at £170 million.  The association said that is incorrect as the annual cost will be reduced every year because of the unfortunate annual death toll which reduces the number of pensions. We have to accept that.</P>
      <P>I raise those issues because that association has been in touch with me many times about them. It is appropriate that they should be raised and considered by the Minister before the final detail is announced.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that while a legitimate case was made by the Opposition and supported by organisations outside the House, the answer early on denying the case was made by way of figures which appear to have been totally inflated. Surely, when such issues are raised we should be in a position to obtain more accurate figures.</P>
      <P>I am worried that the current campaign in relation to the family income supplement is being dealt with in the same fashion.  It is an issue to which I will return.  The exact cost of these schemes should be available and should be fully and factually correct when presented to the House.  They should be available to the Opposition at all times.</P>
      <P>I congratulate all those who have been involved in this campaign.  I am delighted to have been associated with them all both inside and outside the House.  I have been asked what I will do about this motion.  I do not believe in silly parliamentary activity.  I accept that the <i>pro rata</i> pension has now been established in principle and on that basis I will not put the issue to a vote.  I will reserve my final position until I see the detail.  As far as I am concerned, the <i>pro rata</i> pension campaign has been brought to a successful conclusion and I am delighted to have been involved in leading it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children for taking the debate, although I would have preferred the Minister for Agriculture and Food to be here.  I am experiencing difficulty in my constituency.  My telephone will have to be taken off the hook soon if something is not done about the Area Aid Unit.  The number of calls I am getting every day from farmers who want to get through to the Area Aid Unit because of difficulties with digitisation is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister made a decision to the effect that an applicant's area aid form needed to be cleared before any premium, or headage or tillage payment could be made.  In the context of the crisis facing farmers, this decision is misguided.</P>
      <P>A further decision was made in recent weeks to the effect that the Area Aid Unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food would no longer answer the telephones.  This decision was made on the basis that the staff were inundated with queries about area aid, in particular from farmers who were unsuccessful in their applications for headage premia.  As a result of the level of telephone calls, staff were unable to process the area aid applications, and a decision was made not to answer the telephones.</P>
      <P>Because of this decision, farmers making a call to the Area Aid Unit now end up talking to the answering machine.  This is highly unsatisfactory, and the Minister must take action to reverse this unprofessional way of dealing with the farming community.  It goes against the rights of farmers as indicated in the charter of rights for farmers.</P>
      <P>I have received a plethora of queries from farmers with regard to area aid in recent weeks. I tabled seven or eight Dáil questions today, the replies to which were all the same &mdash; they would not be paid their headage premia until such time as their area aid had been sorted out.  However, they cannot sort out their area aid because they cannot get through to the Department.</P>
      <P>Initially when the farmers submitted their area aid applications, they were advised by the Department of Agriculture and Food that the Department would contact them if there were any difficulties, but it was only on inquiring at the local office why headage payments were late that farmers were told there was a problem with the area aid.  The Department did not fulfil its promise by contacting the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year has been a dreadful year for farmers. There are only six weeks to Christmas Day and many farmers still have not received their cheques.  It seems likely that they will not have them for Christmas.  It would take all the staff in the Area Aid Unit just to deal with my constituency. I am asking the Minister for Agriculture and Food, through the Minister here tonight, to <Col N="140" /> put extra staff in the Area Aid Unit for a number of weeks just to clear the backlog.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food will come before our council meeting on Friday night.  If the Minister cannot give a satisfactory reply tonight, I hope there will be some good news by the end of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He asked me to take the debate in respect of the issue raised by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may be aware, a major reorganisation of the Area Aid Unit was undertaken earlier this year by the Department of Agriculture and Food and was completed in April.  This reorganisation involved a new management structure and the division of the unit into five distinct sections, each with responsibility for a specified group of counties.  This action was necessary to eliminate a backlog of 19,700 cases carried over from 1997.  It was aimed at putting procedures in place to ensure the delivery of 1998 payments in accordance with the provisions of the EU Integrated Control and Administration system and, especially, full compliance with the requirements of the land parcel identification system.  Derogations from the provisions of the land parcel identification system had been obtained in 1996 and, again in 1997, from the EU Commission who had made it clear that a similar derogation would not be granted in respect of 1998 or future years.</P>
      <P>Processing of 1998 area aid applications was based on the objective of delivering this year's payments in line with the targets set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  The key target dates are: in relation to headage &mdash; payments to commence in September and to be completed in all eligible cases by 31 October; in relation to the special beef/suckler cow premia &mdash; advance payments of 60 per cent to commence on 1 November with all eligible applicants to be paid by 31 December; in respect of arable aid &mdash; payments to commence on 16 October and to be completed in all eligible cases by 31 October; in respect of the ewe premia scheme &mdash; payment of each instalment to commence within seven days of formal EU adoption of the necessary regulation and to be completed within one month.</P>
      <P>In view of the difficulties for farmers brought about by the combination of poor weather conditions during the summer and the decline in beef prices, it was decided to bring forward the cattle headage date by three weeks, and to get Commission agreement for the earlier payment of special beef and suckler cow premia at a higher rate of 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These actions were vital in enhancing the cash flow position of many farm families.  However, they had the effect of greatly reducing the processing time available to the Area Aid Unit to complete its task.  The earlier payment of cattle headage in 1998 commenced while the processing of a sizeable number of the 1998 area aid applications <Col N="141" /> were still ongoing and resulted in the Area Aid Unit being inundated with telephone call inquiries from farmers.  In the circumstances, a decision was taken, albeit reluctantly, to discontinue receiving phone calls and to concentrate on contacting farmers individually by phone and letter instead to expedite outstanding payments. This process is ongoing and the payment levels achieved are clear evidence of the success of the strategy.  The total amount paid to date in 1998 under the headage and premia schemes is some £718 million, of which over £419 million relates to payments under the 1998 schemes.  In the past week alone some £34 million has been paid out. When BSE/agrimonetary payments are excluded, the total amount paid under the 1998 schemes to date is £397 million.  The corresponding figure paid at this time last year under the 1997 schemes was some £240 million.</P>
    <P>This huge increase in the level of payments is due mainly to improvements brought about in the clearance of area aid application processing which must take account of the complex requirements of the land parcel identification system. Without suspending the phone service, it would simply not have been possible to achieve these payment levels.  Staff in the area aid unit continue to identify those farmers awaiting payment.  The majority have already been communicated with and the area aid unit is writing to the remaining farmers with a view to clearing problems.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has previously stated in the House, his Department has placed considerable emphasis on customer services and has made significant improvements to those aspects of its functions.  However, a large volume of payments are concentrated in a relatively short period; 340,000 payments have issued since 1 October last.  The performance in delivering direct payments this year has been extremely good given the complexities involved and compares more than favourably with the level of service delivered in other member states.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to restore a full telephone service in the area aid unit at the earliest opportunity and his officials are examining the possibility of having an earlier closing date for 1999 area aid applications to maximise the total amount of processing time available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to brief the Minister on the worsening crisis at University College Hospital Galway because of the threatened closure of two wards and the laying off of 45 nurses. It must be borne in mind that these closures are on top of 110 bed closures five weeks earlier in the year.  The hospital has had the greatest increase in waiting lists of any health board hospital.  Between June 1997 and June 1998 the waiting lists increased from 2,079 to 2,891, an increase of 812 or 39 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government came to power, a public representative from the constituency became <Col N="142" /> Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  At the time, there were 1,386 people on the waiting lists who, 12 months later, are still on the waiting list.  There is now a waiting list to get on the waiting list.  The closure of the surgical ward will now add another 800 to the waiting list before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the worry, chaos and hardship he is causing by allowing the wards to close and nurses to be laid off?  I expect he will tell me in his prepared reply that it is the function of the management to stay within its budget but it is the duty and responsibility of the Minister to provide adequate funding to run the health board services.  The acting chief executive officer maintains that the Western Health Board is £1 million short of a budget and that, if he had the money, the wards and theatres could be kept open and the nurses kept on.  There is a legitimate case for the £1 million to be given to the Western Health Board.  The Minister only gave it an increase this year of 1.5 per cent whereas inflation is running at 3 per cent.  Had the board been allocated a budget in line with inflation, it would have received an additional £750,000.</P>
    <P>Another extra cost on the health board this year was the cleaning costs attached to the refurbishment of the hospital, which were £300,000. This money, if returned to the health board, would keep the wards open.  The Minister may make play of the 1996 Act which states that health boards should stay within their budgets. The Act was agreed by all parties.  At that time, the Minister for Health provided money to clear a deficit of £3.8 million in the Western Health Board region.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in law to stop the Minister introducing a Supplementary Estimate to deal with this problem.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform yesterday introduced such an Estimate of £81 million to deal with excess expenditure in his Department.  There are several other precedents for Supplementary Estimates. The introduction of such to allow for a payment of £1 million to the Western Health Board, which the Minister short changed earlier this year, would restore some normality to the serious situation now developing at University College Hospital.  I appeal to the Minister to seek that Supplementary Estimate so that his commitments to the health board can be met.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting the item and the Minister for his presence.  I am glad to have the opportunity to express on behalf of many people in Galway city and county my complete disgust and anger at the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Fahey, for his callous and dismissive statements regarding the closure of the two wards and one theatre at University College Hospital Galway and the consequent dismissal of 45 nursing staff. Is he aware of the hardship such action has caused within the community in County Galway? He has discredited the Department of Health and <Col N="143" /> Children by his careless and unconsidered comments and allegations.  He has taken the easy option for himself to save what remains of his own credibility in the matter, which is now seriously in decline.  He has blamed management once again for creating the problems.  He commented on local radio that there was bad management and bad bed and patient management at University College Hospital.  He said the problems were fundamental management ones and that new management structures put in place were not working.  He also said there was no point in throwing good money after bad.  This is a terrible indictment of all involved, from management to nursing and other professionals.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister of State, through the Minister, to withdraw or substantiate these scurrilous statements, which damn the very people delivering a service at the hospital.  It is a shortage of funds which is causing the problem.  He has ignored the fact that, while he was a Senator trying to get elected to the Dáil, he declared himself a people's candidate and made funding and facilities at the hospital an election issue.  He even brought radio programmes to the casualty unit at the hospital, which shows how professionally unethical he can be to achieve his own end.  Now he has turned his back on them and says there is nothing he can do.  He even blames legislation by the former Minister to save his bacon.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide the extra funding and not allow the closure of the two wards and theatre, especially St. Pius's ward, which is one of the main surgical wards in the hospital.  It will add further to an already unacceptable waiting list at the hospital.  We already have the worst waiting lists in the country. Will the Minister meet with the health board to undo some of the damage done by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the morale of the management, the nursing staff and the professional people who have always in the past put health care as their priority?  I appeal to the Minister to act on behalf of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputies Ulick Burke and McCormack to address the House on the issues raised by the temporary closure of beds and an operating theatre at University College Hospital Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act came into force under the previous Administration in 1996.  It obliges health boards to agree to adopt an annual service plan on the basis of a level of approved net expenditure which should not exceed the non-capital determination notified to the board by my Department for that year.  This legislation places a legal obligation on health boards to deliver service plans within budget as any overrun on expenditure will translate into a first charge on the following year's allocation. Responsible management dictates that, where a health board is projecting a year-end deficit on <Col N="144" /> the basis of activity in a particular area exceeding service plan targets, it should take measures to control this activity to remain within budget.  It is a matter for local health board management to make a judgment on what are the most appropriate and effective measures in such circumstances. To fail to act would be to present the health board with a significantly greater problem in the following year with a consequent potentially severe impact on service provision.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation health board management is responsible for achieving the agreed activity targets set out in the service plan.  Ideally, activities should be planned and controlled over the full 12 months to ensure this is done, although, as Deputies will appreciate, orderly planning of activity in the acute hospital sector is complicated by the level of emergency admissions.</P>
    <P>It is within this overall context that Western Health Board management has decided to engage in the measures being undertaken at University College Hospital, Galway.  These are a response, in fulfilment of its legislative responsibilities, to a projected yearend budgetary deficit of £1.9 million on the acute hospital programme.  The Western Health Board has confirmed that the activity targets agreed in the 1998 service plan for University College Hospital, Galway will be achieved.  In other words, the temporary closures do not represent cuts in service provision.  The hospital will treat the number of patients that it set out to treat at the beginning of the year.  The measures are aimed not at achieving cuts but at aligning activity levels with the service plan targets which are based on the financial allocation available to the hospital.  The allocation available this year is £45.4 million, an increase of more than £5.4 million on the overall allocation in 1997 which was provided by the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>It is on the overall level of activity delivered rather than the number of overnight beds available that the performance of University College Hospital, Galway should be judged.  This is because the number of in-patient beds available does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  This is due to trends in modern medical practice for a marked shift in care from in-patient to day case level, a trend strongly reflected at University College Hospital, Galway where for the first nine months of the year day case activity has been running at 13 per cent above 1997 levels while in-patient admissions are down 6 per cent over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>On the laying off of temporary nursing staff, I am assured by health board management that it will do all that is possible to ensure it is not necessary to take this course of action and towards this end I understand the health board is engaged in discussions with the nursing unions locally with a view to ensuring that with their co-operation the temporary closures can proceed without any temporary loss of jobs.  This would largely be <Col N="145" /> achieved through permanent staff availing of annual leave and job-sharing opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the co-operation of the unions locally will be forthcoming in ensuring this can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that University College Hospital, Galway is entering a phase of major capital development that will transform the level and range of acute hospital services available to people in the west in the medium and long term. I recognised the need for this when on taking office I approved the preparation of a development control plan for the hospital.  Phase 2 of the major capital development is in planning at a capital cost of more than £40 million.  We are engaged in a phased programme of commissioning the new units being completed under phase 1.  I hope to accelerate this process in 1999.</P>
      <P>These developments are aimed at ensuring the needs of this region are addressed in a structured and comprehensive manner and underline my commitment and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the enhancement of hospital services in Galway.  Unlike the party of the Deputies opposite which did nothing when in office, the Minister of State has delivered.</P>

      <P>Western Health Board management is acutely aware of the opportunities that lie ahead in this major capital development.  In the meantime there is an onus on it to ensure it is positioned to avail of these by ensuring it discharges its legislative duties in the implementation of the service plan for University College Hospital, Galway.  I reminded health board members of their legislative duties last December before the allocation was made.  I am satisfied the board will provide the level of service for the people of Galway that it set out to provide in the service plan and it is a matter for it to ensure this is managed within budget.  Board members must not shirk their legal responsibilities.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Aurel and Sylvia Costina are decent, honest people.  They came here five years ago hoping to make Ireland their permanent residence.  They did things the right way. They applied for political asylum but were refused.  Again, they did things the right way. They appealed against the decision but the appeal was turned down last year.  Again, they did things the right way.  Last January they wrote to the Minister and begged to be allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds.  The Minister had executive power to accede to their request.  Not alone did they not receive a reply to their plea but the treatment meted out to them on the instructions of the Minister and the Department was degrading and humiliating.</P>
      <P>We like to think of ourselves, as seen through the eyes of outsiders, as being models of fairness and civility but the manner in which this husband and wife and their children were arrested in a dawn swoop at 6.45 a.m. smacked of the tactics which characterised the Gestapo.  There was no advance notice and they were not served with a deportation order.  There was a knock on the door, they were told to pack their bags, that they were being deported that afternoon.  Even if they were to be deported, they were entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.  To put them in a cell and leave them behind bars for four and a half hours was reminiscent of the treatment one could have expected from the tyranny of the regime which ruled their native Romania not so long ago.</P>
      <P>Why was their initial application turned down in 1994, particularly given that Mr. Costina's brother and his family and Mrs. Costina's brother and his family were allowed to stay and given work permits?  Why was their appeal turned down last year?  Why did the Minister not reply to their plea to exercise his prerogative to permit them to stay on humanitarian grounds?  Why, since the Department knew where they lived, was the deportation order not served on them personally? Why has the Minister not put in place a properly structured administrative system that is fair, open, transparent and efficient to deal with the sensitive area of asylum-seeking in a dignified way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that the family is being given another opportunity to appeal for permission to remain but it should not have reached this stage.  Their initial application should have been granted. These are people who have a positive contribution to make to life here, if they were only given a chance.  Mr. Costina is an engineer.  He would like to work but is not allowed to do so. Mrs. Costina is a woman of considerable character and ability.  The boys have integrated so well that they would be very much at home on Hill 16 on Leinster final day.  This family should be relieved of their anxiety and apprehension now. <Col N="147" /> They should be told that their appeal is being granted and they are also entitled to an apology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the arrest of the Costina family and their detention is something that Irish people find deeply shocking.  For the first time we have revealed to us the secret and subterranean world in which families are woken in the early hours of the morning and disappear by the will of the authorities out of the country.  For the first time the reality of deportation has been brought into the open and it is not a pretty sight.  In this case the family were told without warning that they were being deported.  I understand there was some confusion regarding deportation papers but that does not alter what happened.  While it ensured a reprieve for this distraught and terrified family it also raises questions concerning the validity of the procedures in this case and the arrest of the Costina family.</P>
      <P>Three members of the family were woken early in the morning in their own home by members of the Garda Síochána.  One son was staying with relatives and was not in the house.  They were told to get dressed and were not paid the normal courtesies.  No privacy was permitted.  They were brought to Store Street Garda Station where they were locked in a holding cell.  They were not given access to toilet facilities and were only released when they had signed a statement agreeing to leave the country within days.  If such a thing happened to a settled family of Irish people abroad we would be in uproar.  We must recognise that this is an Irish family.  They are part of our community.  During the almost five years they have been living here they have put down roots, made friendships, earned respect in their local community and their children have undergone their formative education in Ireland.  Ireland is now their home.  These boys talk and look like Dubliners, they dress like Irish boys of their own age and play the same sports.  After growing up in this city they are, in effect, Dubliners.  The parents have education and skills that would enable them to work here if they were given a chance. Aurel is an engineer and a topographer.  There is no shortage of work for people like that.  They would not be a burden on the State and they are highly spoken of by school principals and teachers, the local clergy and members of the community.  They have shown their capability to integrate already.  Indeed, there has been quite an extraordinary coming together of opinion in the neighbourhood giving evidence that they would be valued and would be able to support themselves if given a chance.</P>
      <P>I welcome Mr. and Mrs. Costina to the Public Gallery.  They have a right to be here to hear this debate.  They are not alone but are surrounded by friends who have come with them to show solidarity. This is the kind of welcome and support they have received since they came to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> While their application for asylum was refused the family were always given hope and expected that they would eventually be permitted to stay here.  The Minister's change of heart and agreement to reopen the case would be an opportunity to show the same humanity that this family has experienced.</P>
    <P>I thank the media for highlighting this case because we must remember that this family are not alone.  A total of 51 people have been deported already under escort.  This term is a Department euphemism for forcible deportation. Many of these could be as deserving as the Costina family.  We will never know.  However, we can presume that at least some of them are as deserving.  I have heard disturbing reports of a man who was sent back to Algeria and subsequently lost his life there.  I ask the Minister to investigate that matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats voted down the Private Members Bill I tabled earlier this year to provide an amnesty for asylum seekers, some of whom had been here for many years, I warned that tragic cases like this would be the outcome of the harsh approach of the Minister.  I do not believe the majority of Irish people want to see families who have put down roots here and who are able and willing to make a contribution to Irish society being booted out of the country in secrecy in the early hours of the morning.  I ask the Minister to suspend deportations and to look at alternatives in the spirit that reflects the support that exists for this unfortunate family whose only desire is to live and work among us.</P>

Therefore, the Minister may take a fresh look at the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the only Deputy here who represents the constituency in which the family reside I join with other Deputies in confirming the testimonies that have been given for them in the House.  They are a highly regarded family and have deep roots in the community.  They have two children who are participating in the Irish education system.  They have been here for four years and ten months and have not in any way come to the attention of the authorities.  In those unique circumstances, I <Col N="149" /> appeal to the Minister to exercise whatever residual discretion he has in their favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies Higgins and McManus and Deputy Brian Lenihan for raising this matter on the Adjournment and giving us an opportunity to discuss an issue which has been very prominent in media reports over the past number of day.  Ordinarily, I would be reluctant to discuss in the House or in any other public forum the asylum application or immigration status of identifiable individuals.  However, in the present case it would appear that the family in question have opted to air this whole matter in public and in these circumstances I consider that I am entitled to respond.  I will set out the salient facts of this case.</P>
      <P>The family came to the State in January 1994, arriving at Shannon Airport from Havana, Cuba. On arrival they, together with two other related families, sought asylum.  In 1995, the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Ms Joan Burton, rejected their asylum application following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  In the communication received from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees it was noted that the family had been issued with travel documents at the Romanian embassy in Havana for their return journey to Bucharest.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that in view of the ease with which they obtained the new passports in Cuba and for other reasons it was the opinion of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that none of the issues raised by the family gave rise to a claim for refugee status as defined in the Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>The applicants then appealed the decision of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and this was decided on 2 September 1997 by an independent appeals authority.  I will deal later with the inaction by the previous Government which gave rise to this delay.  This authority concluded that the applicants had failed to give any substantial evidence of persecution.  He noted that the applicants' two children had returned to Romania on holiday.  The independent authority further stated that it appeared in the course of the evidence before him that the applicants had been issued with a passport by the Romanian Consul in Dublin. The appeal authority decided that the applicants had not justified their claim for refugee status.  I accepted the appeal authority's conclusion. To apply for a travel document or passport at the embassy of the country which is allegedly persecuting the applicant has to be seen as inconsistent with the asylum claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January of this year the family was advised that their appeal had failed and that they had 14 days to either leave the State voluntarily or make representations to me as to why they should not be deported.  In late January, a response was received from the solicitors.  Essentially, they <Col N="150" /> sought permission for the family to remain here on a number of grounds.  The first was that they had relatives in the State who had been allowed to remain on the basis of having Irish born children; the second was that they had two children who had been here for four years and were attending school, the older child being on the verge of doing his leaving certificate; the third was that the family were of good character and had made many friends in their local area and were anxious to make a contribution to Irish society, and the fourth was that Romanian nationals had a right of establishment under an association agreement with the EU.</P>
    <P>As regards the fourth ground, no application to exercise this right of establishment was subsequently made by the family.  My Department wrote to the solicitors seeking to establish when the older son was due to sit the leaving certificate and on 1 May the solicitors confirmed that it was in 1999, not 1998.  The file was submitted to me in late August 1998.  I considered that the grounds advanced by the family for its application to remain in the State were not sufficient to warrant a positive decision on my part.  The fact that the man and woman each had brothers in the State is not a sufficient consideration in the context of family reunification.  The children had spent some years in school here and the family was said to be of good character and both of these considerations are significant in any such application, but they were not decisive.</P>
    <P>In general the circumstances of the case are not such as to distinguish it from a number of others by reference to its humanitarian dimension. Accordingly, I signed the deportation order on 31 August 1998.  This order, together with travel documents and custody warrants, was forwarded to the Garda on 20 October 1998 for implementation. On the same date, a letter informing the solicitors that the orders had been made and sent to the Garda issued.  On 29 October 1998 the family was taken into custody.  My Department has since been informed by the solicitor that the correspondence was not received by him until 30 October &mdash; ten days after it issued from my Department.  The same means of communicating the decision to the applicants' legal representatives is used regularly and without difficulty.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I have requested a senior official of my Department to investigate all aspects of this and to report back to me.  In the meantime, I have also asked the Garda to defer enforcement of the deportation order.  That is where the matter stands at the moment and I will await the report of my senior official before taking any further action.</P>
    <P>I should like to add one further detail which is relevant.  On 30 October 1998 my Department received under cover of a letter from the family's legal adviser, not the same person who formerly represented it, a statement signed by the adult members of the family undertaking that they and their younger son would leave Ireland on 4 November 1998 and saying that they would be most <Col N="151" /> appreciative if I would allow the older son to remain here to complete his leaving certificate and that he would be cared for by his uncle's family. I am prepared to consider this request.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the length of time the family has been in the State.  The greater part of the delay which has occurred in this case resulted from the utter inadequacy of the system for processing asylum claims during the term of office of the previous Government.  One of the delaying factors was the view held at the time when Deputy McManus's party and Deputy Higgins's party were in Government that the State should not pay for legal advice and representation for asylum seekers for their asylum appeals.  When this Government took office in June 1997 there were just 22 staff to deal with the thousands of cases which had built up over the previous two years.  Apparently a few months before that there were four staff assigned to this mammoth task.  I was faced with a chaotic situation where nobody had exercised political leadership, let alone put in place administrative arrangements, and where applicants were left completely in the dark about whether their cases would be dealt with, if ever. The legacy of the previous Government in this area could only be described as a complete and utter shambles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to accept some of the comments made by Opposition politicians in this context.  I doubt if any reasonable person could blame me for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has increased the staffing in this area of the Department almost tenfold to <Col N="152" /> close on 200.  We now aim to deal with new arrivals as they come into the system and, if possible, to give decisions on their applications within six months.  At the same time, we are making substantial inroads into the backlog of applications to such an extent that in a matter of weeks all applications lodged prior to 1997 will be at various stages of processing in the system.  We have established a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; customised premises which includes reception, social welfare and health facilities for asylum seekers, as well as the processing of claims.</P>
    <P>Members opposite and others from time to time have called for full implementation of the Refugee Act.  I have explained the position in that regard times out of number and I see no useful purpose in repeating myself.  The rainbow coalition had ample opportunity to implement the Act in the latter part of 1996 and in the first six months of 1997 when it was in office, but it failed to do so.  In the circumstances I wonder why it has become such a major priority for the parties that made up that Government since they departed office.</P>
    <P>There is one important point I want to make in conclusion.  When people fail in their application for asylum and cannot show good and sufficient reason why permission to remain in the State on other grounds should be granted, it follows logically that they must be asked to leave the State and be deported if necessary.  This is essential to maintain the integrity of the asylum process and is a view strongly shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 November 1998.</P>

As had been decided in advance, given the nature of the meeting, no formal decisions were taken and no written conclusions were issued.  A number of essentially forward looking questions were addressed at the meeting.  Among these are the issues raised at Cardiff last June, namely, the economic role which Europe should play in a global economy; and consideration of how best the Union can be represented externally, including the mechanisms available to co-ordinate policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The meeting commenced with a session with President Arafat who briefed the Heads of State or Government on the Wye Plantation Agreement which had been concluded the previous day. President Arafat thanked the EU for its role in the Peace Process and stressed that the parties involved in the process continued to require the assistance of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Gil Robles, President of the European Parliament, joined the meeting for its next session. His address focused on the role which the European <Col N="154" /> Parliament can play in the issues facing the Union.  He emphasised four themes: the current economic situation in Europe, particularly in the context of the introduction of the Euro; internal and external security matters; harmonising social policy; and democratic legitimacy of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The President of the General Affairs Council, Mr. Wulfgang Schuessel, joined the next session of the meeting.  He raised a number of institutional issues which had been discussed previously at the General Affairs Council (GAC).</P>
    <P>The next part of the meeting commenced with presentations from the Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok; Prime Minister Aznar of Spain; and Prime Minister Blair of the United Kingdom.  The discussion which began in this way was continued over dinner.  I would like to touch on some of the key issues which were raised in those discussions and which were addressed again in the final session on Sunday morning, and to indicate the approach which I adopted.</P>
    <P>On the issues arising out of the Cardiff conclusions such as democratic legitimacy and subsidiarity, I indicated that Ireland supports any moves that would bring the European citizen closer to and have a greater sense of ownership of the European Union.  I stressed however, that on these and other ideas designed to bring Europe closer to the citizen, we feel that the most practical way forward is the entry into force and full implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which contains relevant and useful, if modest, steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>In relation to economic policy co-ordination within the EU, I indicated that we are already well served through the institutional arrangements and the various instruments already in place.  However, I acknowledged that economic and fiscal co-ordination is essential if we are to have an effective response to crises and, indeed, for EMU to succeed.  I emphasised that the Stability and Growth Pact sets out the overall framework for fiscal policies and that stability programmes will set out our individual national approaches.  I stated that existing surveillance procedures should be fully utilised.  The existing procedures for assessing member states fiscal and economic policies should be given time to develop before considering further changes.  I pointed out that Ireland accepts the need to assess the effectiveness of the European Union response, both internally and externally, to a changing international economic situation and to seek improvements where necessary while maintaining the integrity of the institutions and procedures already in place.</P>
    <P>On the issue of co-ordinating fiscal policy and tax harmonisation, a number of countries proposed the notion of a common tax level throughout the EU.  However, it is also true to say that other countries, such as ourselves, have very strong views that tax rates should continue to be decided at a national level.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the role and reform of the <Col N="155" /> GAC, I stressed that in any examination of the role of the Council, Ireland would be concerned that the central link between the General Affairs Council and the European Council be maintained. In this respect, reforms should be oriented towards making this link more direct, more dynamic and more efficient.</P>
    <P>In this context, I expressed support for splitting the agenda of the GAC into a two day session dealing with horizontal issues and external relations, respectively.  However, I emphasised that there is a need to bear in mind that reorganisation is no substitute for the political determination to make a system work and it must work if the Union is to master the immediate challenges it faces.  I also expressed Ireland's support for a rationalisation of the number of council formations.</P>
    <P>In relation to internal security, I stressed that this is a sensitive and important area of work within the EU at the moment and that Ireland is satisfied that it is being addressed in the context of an EU action plan for the area of freedom, security and justice which is proceeding in the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  I pointed out that Ireland considers that the best means of advancing the security of the European Union lies in the development of the action plan which will also include provisions regarding the EU's relationship with third countries.  The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Amsterdam Treaty is also a complex institutional and legal issue and while Ireland is currently outside the Schengen Agreement, we are closely monitoring developments in this area.  It was decided that the Finnish Presidency would host a special summit on justice and home affairs issues.</P>
    <P>I indicated that Ireland attaches great importance to EU wide measures to combat issues such as crime and drug trafficking.  I also expressed support for the ongoing work on the initiative by the Austrian Presidency for the development of an EU strategy paper on migration and asylum policy.</P>
    <P>The meeting raised the challenge of how the European Union can enhance its action for peace and stability in crises such as Kosovo.  It was acknowledged that the EU has a significant combined influence politically, diplomatically and economically.  It was agreed that an increased focus should be given to combining that influence so that it is used as effectively as possible.  On the issue of a high representative for CFSP, I stressed that Ireland believes that this role should be filled by a person with strong political skills and with extensive experience of the EU and its institutions and preferably come from one of the smaller member states.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the Amsterdam Treaty, there was broad agreement that member states should seek to implement those conventions agreed but not yet ratified and also that the fundamental rights of citizens must be protected.</P>
    <P>The German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, <Col N="156" /> attended for the first part of the meeting only. Accordingly, I did not have the opportunity to meet privately with him.  However, I look forward to an early opportunity to do so before the German Presidency of the EU commences on 1 January next year.  While the President of the Commission attended the meeting, I did not hold any private discussions with him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative instigated a wide-ranging programme of modernisation throughout the civil and public service involving both legislative and administrative action.  The Office of the Attorney General is part of the general process.  For instance, the office published a statement of strategy, 1997-99, in April 1997; is subject to the Freedom of Information Act for matters of general administration, and is involved in the developments relating to financial management such as administrative budgets and the internal management advisory committee system.</P>
      <P>Key developments relating to the office this year are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> 1.  the publication of a first annual report in May,</P>
    <P>2.  the Attorney General's decision to consent to the application of the Public Service Management Act to his office with effect from 1 September 1998.  The director general of the office is required to prepare and submit to the Attorney General a strategy statement within six months after the coming into operation of the Act in respect of that office, and this is now in preparation, and</P>
    <P>3.  the expected availability of the Irish Statute Book on CD ROM at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Other developments such as the establishment of the statute law revision and consolidation unit within the Office of the Attorney General are in hand.  Discussions between the office and the Department of Finance about the staffing of the new unit and the overall staffing requirements of the State's drafting services are continuing.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on the law offices of the State was published on 24 February 1998.  The Government accepted the recommendations of the review group for: a study of proposals for a unified prosecution service; a separate Statute Law Revision and Consolidation Unit and a Consultative Committee among the Law Offices.</P>
    <P>The membership and terms of reference of the group which is to review the legal and organisational arrangements for the public prosecution system were announced on 6 October 1998.  The study will be carried out under the auspices of the Attorney General and the group will be chaired by Mr. Dermot Nally, former secretary to the Government.  A press release listing the membership and terms of reference of the group was placed in the Oireachtas Library and I am circulating the relevant details with this reply for inclusion in the Official Report.  The secretariat for the study will be provided by the Institute of Public Administration and the group has been asked to report back to Government by end June 1999.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended that a consultative committee be established, on a trial basis of two years, to promote greater liaison and communication among the law offices on issues of common interest.  The committee has been established and it has met twice to date.  It is chaired by the Office of the Attorney General and membership includes the law offices, the Law Reform Commission and departmental legal advisers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the briefings I gave the House on the work of the centre on 11 March, 6 May and 23 June last, the National Centre for Partnership has been actively engaged in pursuing its work programme in both the private and public sectors and this has continued over the last six months.</P>
      <P>In the private sector, the centre has initiated a series of regional seminars on the topic of Partnership at Enterprise Level.  The first was held in UCD in early June and further seminars were held in Cork and Galway during October.  The seminars targeted senior management, union officials and other parties with interest in the topic.  Both IBEC and ICTU have been active participants in the seminars and the feedback from the seminars has been positive.</P>
      <P>The joint IBEC/ICTU project &mdash; Partnership in Action at Enterprise Level, (PACT) &mdash; under the EU ADAPT initiative has commenced. Under the project, eight teams have been established on a regional basis made up of management and employee representatives from selected companies, an IBEC executive and a trade union official.  The teams are assessing and surveying their own needs and the needs of the companies involved in order to develop enterprise partnership.  The project will run to the end of 1999, with the objective that the teams will act as catalysts and facilitators for other enterprises in their region.  The centre is liaising with the co-ordinators of the project in order to learn from the experience and disseminate the information.</P>
      <P>The centre has established a computer database containing details on either multi-stranded or single partnership issues existing in enterprises with the intention of monitoring existing developments and expanding as more details emerge via surveys, direct contact and other sources of information available to the centre.  The identification of a number of enterprises on a cross-sectoral basis where partnership topics are being successfully practised will be made easier with access to this database.  It is intended that suitable enterprises will be documented and video taped with a view to disseminating their experiences and shortening the learning curve of other enterprises on the partnership path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the public sector, a series of regional seminars have been arranged for the Civil Service, local government and health sectors. These seminars commenced in Sligo on 20 <Col N="160" /> October and Cork on 29 October.  Further seminars are scheduled for Galway and Dublin, finishing on 18 November.  Due to high demand, the centre may schedule further seminars for Dublin after this date.  The Irish Productivity Centre is assisting in the organisation and delivery of the seminars.  The audience consists of management,</P>
    <P>union and staff representatives with the objective of promoting partnership locally and to create a platform for updating representatives on developments in the local government and health sectors in particular.  In addition, a joint National Centre for Partnership/Irish Management Institute seminar on the implications of partnership for management development in the public service was held on 22 September and was well received.</P>
    <P>Many Civil Service departments and offices now have their partnership committees in place and the centre is assisting in putting partnership structures in place in the wider public service.  A group has been established, chaired by my Department, consisting of representatives of Departments with bodies under their aegis, the Local Government Management Services Board, the Health Service Employers Agency and the National Centre for Partnership.  Progress is being made towards the wide establishment of partnership structures, with facilitation and assistance from the centre.</P>
    <P>The centre is finalising training materials for public sector partnership and it is expected they will be complete within the next six weeks.  These will be disseminated as widely as possible, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Also, the centre will produce the first of its partnership bulletins during November.  This will contain a range of information on partnership topics as well as working experiences of various forms of partnership.  It is envisaged that five bulletins will be produced between now and March 2000.</P>
    <P>On a general note, as a result of a widening interest, not just in Ireland, of enterprise level partnerships, the centre has had discussions with French and Danish groups to exchange experiences. Further international contacts are being pursued by the joint directors.</P>

      <P>The Inter-Departmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment meets on average every six to eight weeks and has met on 30 occasions since its inception in October 1995.  The most recent meeting took place on 15 September and this was followed by a meeting with the social partners on 23 October to discuss labour market policy in the context of the forthcoming budget.  These and other issues were explored further at the Partnership 2000 plenary meeting on 28 October.</P>
      <P>The group is examining at present the operation of active labour market policies in the light of changing labour market conditions and the aims and strategies set out in the national employment action plan.  This examination will also take into account the various reviews of labour market intervention measures either completed, under way or planned.  It is envisaged that this work will determine the agenda for future meetings of the group, both for the remainder of this year and the early months of next year.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach's strategy statement, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998, sets out the priorities for my Department for the period 1998-2001.  The formulation and achievement of these priorities is of course an ongoing process as the Department responds to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in achieving these priorities, including the successful negotiation of the British-Irish Agreement and its implementation, which is ongoing; the continued implementation of Partnership 2000, further development of the partnership process and paving the way for a successor agreement; the ongoing development of national policy in relation to European and international affairs, with a particular regard to ensuring that Ireland continues to play an effective role in the work of the European Council on major issues on the European agenda; strategy statements for all Departments and offices were laid before the Oireachtas on 1 May last.  The preparation of business planning and putting in place of the framework for assignments of responsibilities provided for under the Public Service Management Act, 1997 will be completed by the end of the year.  These measures will provide the basis for the putting in place of an ongoing process of managing performance based on individual and team objectives at all levels across the Civil Service; employment and business at the IFSC continues to grow strongly and a co-ordinated approach to support the centre's long-term development is being pursued; the production of an updated and comprehensive Cabinet handbook; the facilitation of access by the public to information held by my Department, as provided for in the Freedom of Information Act; the implementation of a number of measures designed to facilitate greater co-ordination between the State's legal offices, including the establishment of a study group to consider proposals for a unified prosecution service and a consultative committee to promote greater liaison and communication among the law offices on issues of common interest; the organisation of an extensive programme of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the 1798 Rebellion and the ongoing work on a programme of events to celebrate the new millennium; and the roles and functions of the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum have been reviewed. Each has a unique contribution to make to the process of social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nomination procedure has now been completed and the National Economic and Social Council had its inaugural meeting this morning. <Col N="166" /> The inaugural meeting of the National Economic and Social Forum has been arranged for 12 November. The heads of a Bill to place both bodies on a statutory footing have been approved by the Government and are at present with the parliamentary draftsman's office for drafting.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request, the IFSC Clearing House Group is preparing a strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.</P>
      <P>This strategy will primarily focus on the need to maximise the level of sustainable economic activity and employment in international financial services in Ireland, building upon the existing activity in the IFSC.  This should encompass not only the number of jobs, but also the quality of employment and activity, and the possibility of enhancing sustainability through links to related sectors such as shared services and electronic commerce.  The strategy will outline a clear vision for the Government to adopt and implement.</P>
      <P>The strategy will address issues concerning: the future location of the industry and the provision of infrastructure for the continued growth of the IFSC; the future marketing and promotion of the sector; how to ensure a continued supply of skilled employees for IFSC companies, the need for a tax regime supportive of competitiveness, while recognising EU and domestic constraints; measures to enhance the competitiveness of the centre through company law legislation; the need to maintain the existing high standard of regulation of the industry; the implications of the introduction of the euro; new business opportunities based around the existing level of financial services activity in the centre and the structures necessary to implement the strategy.</P>
      <P>There have been recent discussions at international and EU level on the international community's response to the crisis in financial markets. The Government has participated in these discussions and the crisis remains a matter of serious concern to Ireland given the open nature of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of recent turbulence on world financial markets will also be taken into account in the strategy being prepared by the IFSC Clearing House Group.  This strategy will recognise the need for a flexible response to emerging international problems.  The centre is still highly competitive and has limited exposure to the countries most affected.  In my view, the most effective response to these events is to enhance the already <Col N="167" /> strong competitive position of the IFSC and that will be a key objective of the strategy.</P>

The programme for the visit included meetings with myself and Government Ministers, and with representatives from Irish industry, the financial sector, education and local enterprise.</P>
      <P>The next board meeting has not yet been scheduled.  The practice over some years now has been to have a meeting in the St. Patrick's Day period and I intend to do that in March next.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 49, 74, 99 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a comprehensive array of proposals from local authorities for coastal protection works.  These include projects submitted for consideration under the Coast Protection Measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999 and a considerable number of other projects submitted subsequently.  It is estimated that the total cost of these works would be over £35 million.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there was only £5 million available for coast protection under the operational programme in question.  I am circulating in the Official Report a list of the schemes which have received grant aid under the programme and the total costs of the works involved.</P>
      <P>The coastal erosion problem is undoubtedly significant.  A study a number of years ago by the County and City Engineer's Association estimated some 1,500km of the coastline to be at risk with some 490km needing immediate attention. The problems however, likely to be exacerbated by the rise in sea levels associated with global warming, and expected increases in storm frequency and wave heights.  It will be essential, therefore, to have an overall national strategy for addressing the problem, which will facilitate a clear and systematic identification and prioritisation of coast protection needs and the appropriate means of responding to specific instances of erosion.  I intend to pursue the development of this strategy, in co-operation with other relevant Ministers, over the coming year.  I will also be seeking in the next round of Structural Funds, a level of funding for coast protection commensurate with the serious problems which we face.</P>

      <P>A report on the investigation of the loss of the fishing vessel <i>Carrickatine</i>, undertaken by the Marine Survey Office of my Department, has now been finalised and will be published next week.</P>
      <P>I am having arrangements made for each of the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy to be presented with copies of the report in advance of its general release.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, I regret that progress in having this and indeed other marine casualty reports published has been slower than I would like.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have already accepted the general thrust and content of the recently published report of the Investigation of Marine Casualties Policy Review Group which was set up to review the existing policy, procedures and legislative framework for maritime casualty investigations in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government to address the recommendations made by the review group.  In this regard, work is under way in my Department on the preparation of the required legislative framework to implement the key proposal which is the establishment of a new statutory marine casualty investigation board. The board, when established, will have enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to expeditiously publish reports of the board's findings.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new system of investigation, identified by the review group, will resolve the current difficulties regarding the publication of reports, and will help me to achieve my central aim which is to put in place a modern casualty investigation system which will have clear procedures and purpose, and which will meet the needs and expectations of all the various interested parties in relation to such investigations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The company in question informed the Department of mortality problems in May and June of this year.  Initial tests by the Department's fish health pathologist on fish sampled yielded no pathogenic organisms on culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further reports of mortalities on the farm were <Col N="171" /> brought to my Department's attention in late July.  An inspection of the farm was carried out on a joint basis by the Marine Institute and the Department on 19 August last.  Further inspections were carried out on 5 and 6 October by the Department's fish health pathologist.</P>
    <P>The report of the fish health pathologist has indicated that the principal cause of mortalities on the farm was a severe form of pancreas disease (PD) known as sudden death syndrome (SDS), for which there is no effective treatment.  Neither disease posed any threat to wild fish since neither PD nor SDS occurs or has ever been described as occurring in wild fish.  There is absolutely no risk to human health from PD and SDS as these conditions occur only in farmed salmon.</P>
    <P>In incidents such as that which occurred on this site, the normal response by companies is an accelerated harvest of healthy fish.  In this case the company followed this procedure and arranged the removal of the mortalities to a rendering plant in County Meath.  I understand that as this could only be arranged on a weekly basis it was necessary to store the dead fish in containers on the cage-raft and there is no evidence to suggest that dead fish were dumped at sea.</P>
    <P>The reports of the inspections carried out are being assessed at present by my Department and their conclusions will be conveyed to the company in question.  The conclusions will also be conveyed to concerned parties including the Western Regional Fisheries Board and the Central Fisheries Board.  The evidence available at this stage suggests that a particularly difficult situation was handled as well as possible by the company.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the level of air-sea coverage available on all Irish coasts; if he has satisfied himself that a single engine helicopter based in Waterford provides adequate cover for the south-east coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the level of air-sea coverage available on all Irish coasts meets both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.  The Deputy may be aware that in June 1996 a report was completed on the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage on the east coast covering the area from Carlingford Lough to Youghal and out to the boundaries between the Irish search and rescue region and the United Kingdom regions. All the recommendations made in the report have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.  A review of the level of marine search and rescue coverage on the south and west coasts will take place in the near <Col N="172" /> future as part of the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
      <P>The declared helicopter facilities available to IMES are two IMES Sikorsky all-weather medium load carrying helicopters available 24 hours, based at Shannon and Dublin Airports, together with two Air Corps helicopters.  One of the Air Corps helicopters is a light load-carrying Dauphin helicopter available 24 hours based at Finner, County Donegal and the second is an Alouette helicopter based at Waterford Airport providing daylight cover for the east and south east coasts.  The Waterford Airport base will be upgraded to a 24-hour Dauphin helicopter service on 1 July 1999 assuming that the crew numbers remain stable.  This enhancement will complete the helicopter coverage for all Irish coasts and is the implementation of one of the recommendations of the report of the review of the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage on the east coast.</P>
      <P>I should stress that while the IMES helicopters are based at Shannon and Dublin Airports and an Air Corps helicopter is based at Finner, they are available on a 24-hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline.  Their call-out response time is not more than 15 minutes between 7.30 a.m. and 9 p.m. and not more than 45 minutes outside these times throughout the year.  They are positioned so that they can reach, by day, 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour and by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical miles in two hours.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that shore coverage on the Irish coasts comprises the IMES coastal units, of which there are 50 around our coast.  These units are fully equipped to respond to the risks in their area and are on call 24 hours a day.  In addition, a number of declared sea facilities are available to the IMES.  These are facilities designated as being available according to a specific standard or set criteria.  One of these is the RNLI who have 24 lifeboat stations around the coast. Another facility is the community inshore rescue boats of which there are six at present.  The IMES can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and their divers and UK coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 52 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, this is an issue that I have under active consideration at present.  Two days ago, I hosted a major conference in Bunbeg on investment and employment in the county.  At the conference, which was attended by some 226 delegates from the marine industries, I set a target of achieving 1,000 new jobs in marine and related industries.  I know that if we mobilise all the marine sectors in the county we can deliver these jobs.  Delivering on this initiative is crucial. Unemployment in Donegal is, at 20 per cent, the highest in Ireland and is double the national average.</P>
      <P>The marine sector is, after agriculture, the county's biggest employer.  But the full potential of Donegal's unparalleled marine resources has yet to be realised.  I decided to hold the Donegal conference so as to kick-start a marine industries action programme.</P>
      <P>Participants at Monday's conference outlined their views on opportunities and the initiatives needed to foster the contribution of the marine sector to employment and the economy in Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have asked the conference organisers to prepare a report for me within the next few weeks on the various initiatives and opportunities identified. I intend to submit the report, through my representative on the task force, to the Donegal Employment Initiative, in order to assist the task force in identifying opportunities and emphasising the role of marine resources in local development.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, I will consider the issues and initiatives raised with a view to seeing how my Department and the associated agencies can move this process forward to harness the county's indigenous resources to create long-term stable employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 106 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the claims by a retired merchant seaman that an Irish shipping company may have been involved in the dumping of toxic and possibly radioactive waste in the Irish Sea in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  I welcome the fact that he has now decided to put this information in to the public domain.  I have asked the task force on radioactive dumping to speak to him with a view to determining the nature, quantity and location of the materials allegedly dumped and to take account of his information in preparing its final report.  Deputy Gormley raised this matter previously but a lack of detailed information made the investigation of this particular allegation difficult to pursue.  I asked Deputy Gormley to provide me with any information he had which would assist in the investigation but he appears to have been unable to do so.  The action of this retired seaman in coming forward now will make such an investigation possible.  Furthermore, I would encourage anyone with any similar information to make it available.  I would hope to use such information as the basis for a fresh approach to the UK authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> I expect to receive the report of the task force as soon as it has had an opportunity to assess this new information.  As I have previously indicated, it is my intention to publish the report of the task force.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that 28 phosphorous devices were washed up along the east coast between 3 and 8 June 1998.  A further device was washed ashore on 19 July 1998.  These devices apparently originated in the Beaufort Dyke dump site, which lies between the coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>While I am relieved that no further devices have been washed ashore, I am obviously very concerned that any devices should have appeared in this way.  I am disappointed that these devices have apparently originated in the Beaufort Dyke dump site despite a management regime for the dump site which was agreed at ministerial level with the UK two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as devices started to come ashore I contacted the relevant UK ministers to express the Irish Government's serious concern at these developments and to impress upon them the need to find a solution to the problem.  In addition, officials of my Department were in regular contact with their counterparts in the various UK Departments concerned.  Following a direct request from me to the UK Secretary of State for Defence, officials of my Department and the Marine Institute travelled to London to meet senior officials from a range of UK Government Departments and agencies at the Ministry of Defence.  They reiterated the Irish Government's concern about recent events.  The meeting reviewed the history of the dump site, the surveys that had been carried out by the Scottish Office in 1995 and 1996, and also past and future activities in the area.  So far, however, it has not been possible to identify a definite reason for the devices being washed ashore.  My officials pointed to the need to resolve this problem.  They highlighted the need for research into the state of the dump site and the question of reviewing the management regime agreed in 1996.  They identified <Col N="176" /> specific areas for action, including improved communications between Ireland and the UK, an early warning system in the event that munitions are disturbed, and operating instructions and warnings for fishermen and others carrying out work in the area.  A further meeting between the two sides will take place in Dublin shortly to agree further action.</P>
    <P>In addition, at the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR commission on the protection of the marine environment in the north-east Atlantic in July I raised the issue of munitions dumping and drew my colleagues' attention to recent events in Ireland.  The meeting agreed to my suggestion that OSPAR should consider how to address this issue in the future.  My officials will shortly be presenting proposals to OSPAR for further action in this area later this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a viral disease affecting farmed Atlantic salmon. At the outset I should stress that there is absolutely no risk to human health from ISA.  In spring 1998 an outbreak of ISA occurred in the Scottish salmon farming industry.  The Scottish Office stringently applied the EU regulations on the placing on the market of aquaculture animals in the event of an outbreak of this kind.  I have been informed that only gutted salmon from affected areas may be exported from Scotland in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Because of my concerns on this issue I arranged for officials of the Department, BIM and the Irish salmon industry to visit Edinburgh to meet with Scottish Office officials and representatives of the Scottish industry, to learn at first hand the details of the outbreak in Scotland and the specific measures taken in Scotland to combat ISA.</P>
      <P>Under EU law Ireland cannot unilaterally introduce controls on the importation of fish from other member states in circumstances of this kind. However, a number of important measures have been put in place to safeguard against the introduction of the disease.  In particular, the Irish Farmers Association's fish farming section has introduced a code of practice on the subject of ISA for all of its members and for fishermen, veterinarians and fish processors.  The code of practice sets out specific precautionary measures which are aimed at preventing the spread of ISA to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outbreak of ISA in Scotland is also being <Col N="177" /> discussed at EU level by a committee of EU Government experts.  My Department is represented on that committee which is considering actions which can be taken to deal with ISA outbreaks.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor very closely developments relating to the spread of ISA in Scotland. Officials of the Department and BIM and representatives of the Irish salmon industry will maintain close contact with Scottish Office officials and Scottish industry representatives to ensure that every possible measure to prevent the spread of ISA to this country'is taken.</P>

    <P>Overall it is estimated that there are at present approximately 16,000 people employed in the forestry sector.  The strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector, published in 1996, envisages an increase in employment of 11,000 in the context of the implementation of the plan by the year 2020.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Commercial Seaports</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overseen the transformation of the Irish commercial seaports over the past ten years. This transformation has been achieved by a number <Col N="179" /> of major investment programmes (the Operational Programme for Peripherality 1989 to 1993 and the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999, (OPT), the Cohesion Fund and the Ireland/Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme, 1994 to 1999); introduction of new legislation to commercialise the major ports; linking of grant aid to the removal of major institutional bottlenecks in seaports.</P>
    <P>Over the ten year period from 1989 to 1999, the total investment in ports under all of the programmes listed above is estimated to be £220 million, of which some £163 million will have been expended under the current round of OPT, Cohesion and INTERREG initiatives.</P>
    <P>The development of the ports industry could not have been achieved without grant assistance under the above programmes.  The scale of the various funding programmes reflects the low level of investment in the ports industry generally before the programmes were put in place.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these past achievements, there still remain a number of important deficiencies to be addressed in the ports industry. Ports have inadequate facilities to cope with continued massive growth which is forecast in the unitised modes in particular.  Competitive forces between ports need to be strengthened.  Continued reductions in port costs will maximise competition between ports; scope exists to increase efficiency levels to maximise the use of existing infrastructure.  Irish ports need to continue to reduce cost levels to the lowest levels achieved in the best ports internationally.  There is scope for further rationalisation of the port sector through, for example, co-operation agreements between adjacent State ports to maximise services and cost efficiencies to port users.</P>
    <P>Although investment in ports has greatly improved the capacity and quality of port facilities, the level of growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity underlines the need for continued investment.</P>
    <P>In order to determine the needs of the port industry, my Department commissioned two detailed studies in the key areas of port costs and future capacity requirements over the past year: an assessment of costs and charges at commercial seaports; an assessment of Irish commercial seaport capacity.</P>
    <P>Both studies point clearly to the need for a third national port development programme as part of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Based on the examination of the port industries' importance to the economy and of its development needs over the period to 2007, it is clear that a substantial investment programme is required for ports.</P>
    <P>A number of complementary measures have been developed which will seek to maximise the use of existing facilities and infrastructure, and ensure sufficient new infrastructure is added as demand grows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Following a comprehensive consultation process involving all commercial seaports including regional seaports, port and maritime infrastructural development projects have been identified and costed in the context of possible funding allocations under the next round of EU Structural Funding post 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Regional Ports</i>
    </P>
    <P>In relation to regional ports, my Department commissioned independent consultants in October last to undertake a major independent review of the State's regional ports and harbours. The study will cover all State ports and harbours with a commercial traffic of less than 250,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium commits to a marine policy which aims to secure and enhance the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future.  In this context I am committed fully to harnessing, to the fullest extent possible, the development potential of our State regional ports and harbours.  As part of a modernisation process we need to look at all possible options for their development and management.  They are an extremely valuable resource and our aim must be to facilitate appropriate adjustment strategies where this will create jobs and provide opportunities for local development and the local coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The time has come to chart the way forward for these ports and set out a long-term, coherent and sustainable development strategy for their future and the people who rely on them directly and indirectly for their livelihoods.  We need to decide the best and most suitable development options including possible local authority control in terms of their ownership, financing and activities/operations.</P>
    <P>The findings of the review will also inform future investment decisions and requirements at the State regional ports.</P>

      <P>EU Council Directive 94/25/EC of 16 June 1994 deals with the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to recreational craft.</P>
      <P>While the directive requires that member states apply the provisions of the directive from 16 June 1996, a transition period is provided for in Article 13(3) of the directive which means that the obligations deriving from the directive did not come into force until 16 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Recreational Craft) Regulations, 1998, (S.  I. No. 40 of 1998).  These regulations were made on 19 February 1998 and came into force on 28 February 1998.</P>
      <P>Directive 94/25/EC is an example of a &ldquo;New Approach&rdquo; type directive which is aimed at achieving the free movement of goods which in turn will lead to the achievement of an open market for business in Europe.  Its intention is to eliminate technical barriers to trade by approximating design and construction standards for recreational craft throughout the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Drilling operations in the Irish waters provide opportunities for suppliers of goods and services and these opportunities arise mainly from the use of airports and ports as supply and service bases, from the supply of contract support vessels and from the purchase of provisions and other services.</P>
      <P>However, I have no powers to oblige operators engaged in exploration activities in the Irish off-shore to use Irish goods and services.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware the imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations.  It is the policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and services and indeed Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The additional benefits arising from the discovery of commercial quantities of oil and gas would be considerable, though difficult to quantify precisely at this stage.  The direct impact would depend on aspects such as the size of the accumulation, duration of production, flow rates, the cost of development, operating expenses and market price.  The economic benefits resulting directly from the natural gas produced from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields illustrate the obvious importance of indigenous energy supplies. These benefits will reflect the employment in the services sector of engineering and technical industries, technical support industries, the import substitution effect and downstream economic activity.</P>

      <P>The gas find to which the Deputy refers is located in a water depth of 350m in block 18/20 in the Slyne Trough about 70 km west of Achill Island.  An appraisal well drilled this year was successfully tested and production of gas was measured at a stabilised rate of 63 million standard cubic feet of gas per day on a two inch choke.  This test indicates that favourable production rates can be achieved from the Corrib gas discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too early to give an indication of the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery.  This will involve further appraisal work out over the next two to three <Col N="184" /> years, including the drilling of additional appraisal wells.</P>
    <P>My Department receives all data from the operators of licences in respect of exploration, appraisal and development operations.  This data, as well as allowing an independent assessment to be made as to the hydrocarbon potential of an area, enables us to monitor companies at each stage of development and to reach agreement on the next course of action to be taken.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of Irish labour and facilities, it is my policy to ensure the economy benefits to the maximum extent feasible from offshore exploration activities.  However, I have no powers to oblige operators engaged in exploration activities in the Irish offshore to use Irish goods and services.  The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations in force since 1968.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and services and Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and my Department has written to SIPTU and the IOOA urging them to discuss the problem of employment in offshore exploration with the intention of arriving at an acceptable solution.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, receives an annual Exchequer grant of £100,000, which is paid from the Vote of my Department.  When this year's contribution was made I personally wrote to the institution and paid tribute to the valuable and voluntary service provided by its dedicated personnel.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the RNLI is a charitable organisation with a strong tradition of independence and is chiefly supported by voluntary contributions from members of the public in Britain and Ireland.  The annual Government grant is paid, on a no strings attached basis, in recognition of the RNLI's important role in the overall marine search and rescue network which is co-ordinated by the Irish Marine Emergency Service and which I propose to develop into a national coastguard service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to making the annual financial contribution, my Department is committed to assisting the RNLI in other ways.  I have put in place a new partnership structure whereby an assistant secretary has been specifically nominated to liaise <Col N="185" /> between the RNLI, my Department and the marine sector in general with a view to assisting the institution in a practical and operational sense.  I understand this liaison structure is working well and that the RNLI has expressed particular satisfaction regarding progress with advancing its programme of infrastructural shoreworks.</P>
    <P>I am at all times open to suggestions from the RNLI as to how best my Department can further assist the institution with its valuable work. Should the RNLI wish to make proposals to me in relation to any matter, including an increase in the annual grant payable, I will give them serious consideration with full regard to my overriding concern that State funds are expended to the best possible advantage in the area of our maritime rescue services.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently carrying out a major review of the minerals development acts which will address, <i>inter</i> alia, recommendations made by the natural minerals policy review group in April 1995.  This is intended to give rise to proposals for amending legislation next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 20 of 52 recommendations made by <Col N="188" /> the review group have been implemented, in whole or in part, with significant benefit to the minerals industry and the public.  I am favourably disposed to legislating in due course in relation to Recommendation No. 14 and I am glad to announce that I have recently secured Government approval for the drafting of a Bill dealing with the issue.  Five of the remaining recommendations (9, 12, 13, 17, 19) were, in effect, an endorsement of existing practices.  For various reasons I do not propose to implement 14 of the recommendations (6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 26, 37, 40 and 51).  The remaining recommendations would involve action by Departments other than my own or action jointly with other Departments or with the industry while one would require action by the industry.  These outstanding recommendations will be considered in formulating proposals for new legislation and in the meantime they are being pursued at EU, interdepartmental and agency level as opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>Job creation in the mining sector can only come about through the finding and development of economic mineral deposits.  Exploration is a necessary first step to such development and my Department is actively engaged in stimulating inward investment for exploration.  In the last six months a new major international mining company and a new junior Canadian company have committed themselves to substantial exploration in this country.  The number of current licences has also increased over the last ten months against a global trend of exploration retrenchment.</P>
    <P>On the environmental side, we must continue to ensure that, where development takes place, it is carried out in a way that will minimise adverse environmental impacts and will mitigate those which occur.  My Department's endeavours are directed accordingly in close association with the other permitting authorities.  My commitment to maximising responsible mining and exploration is clear and sustained.</P>

The meeting, which was hosted by my Department was attended by representatives <Col N="189" /> of Irish and French fishermen as well as the French Fisheries Ministry.  This was a continuation of an initiative taken earlier this year at my request to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between Irish and French fishermen.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Irish and French fishermen will now work together to develop the operational and technical details of the code of practice, with a view to finalising an agreed code by January next in advance of the spring fishery.</P>
      <P>A recent incident involving an Irish and a French fishing boat was discussed at the meeting on 9 October, and dialogue has been established between the parties concerned with a view to reaching an equitable resolution.  The question of redress in instances of verifiable damage or loss will be pursued with the French authorities as part of the current process of dialogue and co-operation.</P>

During the period of exploration the company concerned more than met the expenditure requirements of the licence.  In accordance with normal practice, the company furnished confidential work reports to my Department and sought and was granted renewal of the licence for a further two year period commencing in March of this year.  In view of the encouraging results of the exploration programme over the first two years, the current work programme includes a feasibility study for mine development which is expected to be completed within the period covered by the renewal of the licence.</P>

      <P>In addition to receiving Exchequer funding of £10.4 million for 1998 and generating their own resources of £1.98 million, the Regional Fisheries Boards are also eligible to undertake development under the tourism angling measure, TAM, of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  This measure envisaged a total expenditure on tourism angling of over £16 million for 1994-99 and an European Regional Development Fund contribution of over £12 million.  TAM supports a range of tourist angling developments including the development of game and coarse fish angling It is open to any Regional Fisheries Board to apply to the TAM unit, which is located in the Central Fisheries Board, for funding under the measure.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year I announced a capital programme of up to £1.5 million for repair and refurbishment of existing harbour infrastructure, as well as expenditure of £200,000 on site and hydrographic investigations for a new berthage option outside the existing harbour.  Technical investigations of this nature are an essential first step in a marine engineering project.  The results will directly inform the process of finalising decisions on the funding, scale and timeframe of new harbour development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no delay in progressing implementation of the recommendations of the herring task force.  Officials of my Department, together with the Marine Institute, BIM and the industry have been working closely since receipt of the report on a comprehensive implementation programme.</P>
      <P>The quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and for the herring processing sector will get under way shortly.  I encourage the industry to progress the industry led herring industry marketing group which is to develop and co-ordinate industry strategies to maximise returns to the herring sector and to act as a forum for dialogue and concerted action.  The group will meet shortly.  The task force's recommendation on the recruitment of a pelagic market co-ordinator to facilitate the focused development of market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry is being progressed in the context of the marketing group.</P>
      <P>At the March Fisheries Council I was successful in reducing the quantity of herring which could be imported tariff free this year to the Community, as strongly recommended by the task force.  I also made it clear at last month's Council that I would oppose strongly any new proposals to increase that tariff free quantity and will continue to press for it to be abolished altogether.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the report of the herring task force was that market research and fishing trials should be undertaken to identify new fisheries and optimum fishing times and opportunities for herring in terms of roe, matje, and fillet markets.  BIM's report on the trials and research undertaken this year will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also provided grant aid towards feasibility R &amp; D trials into alternative loading and unloading systems and technical gear innovations. The task force underlined the importance of loading and unloading systems and gear in the maintenance <Col N="193" /> and improvement of product quality and returns.  This work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that industry participation in the management of the herring fisheries should be enhanced by the management advisory committee.  This has also been implemented, in consultation with the industry, through the setting up this autumn of committees in the Celtic Sea and north west herring fisheries.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that the necessary strategies to deliver and resource herring assessment and survey programmes should be put in place.  At my request the Marine Institute has extended its herring catch sampling programme and resumed acoustic surveys. I also asked the institute to develop a practical partnership approach with the industry including participation by fishermen in stock assessment programmes.  This initiative is well under way.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations made by the task force are also being actively progressed. These include the development of funded R &amp; D programmes and the carrying out of studies into herring offal use, the investigation into the potential markets for herring milt, management and conservation initiatives for the north-west herring fishery, adjustments to the management regime in the Celtic Sea fishery, a review of market support regimes and funding for fish processing projects.</P>
    <P>The implementation programme is comprehensive, prioritised and soundly based in terms of funding and timescales.  Progress has been made, or work completed, on all recommendations.  The Department and the State agencies will continue to work with the industry on all these fronts in addition to monitoring very closely EU and global trends in herring supply and demand which remains worrying.</P>

      <P>Information on the disposal of radioactive wastes around the coast of the UK during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s has been gleaned from the archives of the UK Public Records Office and a number of UK Government Departments.  In many cases the records are limited to letters and memoranda between Government Departments and the minutes of meetings of committees.  In general, while the records refer to particular radionuclides, they do not always specify the quantities involved.  In some cases it is not even certain that the material in question was actually dumped.  Accordingly, part of the task facing the task force on radioactive dumping is to assess the nature of the documentation and use some judgment when estimating the quantities of each substance that was dumped.</P>

      <P>I have granted a petroleum lease to Providence Resources PLC over the Helvick oilfield which is valid for a period of ten years from 1 May 1998.  The field, first discovered in 1983, is situated in the south-west corner of Block 49/9 in the North Celtic Sea Basin about 36 kilometres from the Waterford coast.  The Helvick field is the only area in the Irish offshore for which a petroleum lease for oil production has been granted.  Providence has indicated that it believes that Helvick has an estimated seven million barrels of recoverable oil together with associated gas.  Under the terms of the petroleum lease, the company is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field for my approval by 1 May 2000.  When a detailed plan of development has been assessed and approved by me and when all authorisations for the development have been obtained, the company would then be in a position to install the infrastructure necessary to produce the oil and gas.</P>
      <P>There are two other known oil accumulations of interest in the Irish offshore &mdash; the Connemara field and the Seven Heads field.  &ldquo;Connemara&rdquo;, located in the Porcupine Basin and discovered in 1979, was appraised by Statoil in 1997 with disappointing results and the company concluding that the field was not commercial.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Seven Heads oil and gas accumulation in the Celtic Sea discovered in 1974, interested companies were invited to apply for a lease undertaking by 8 April this year but no applications were received.  I still have hopes that parties will express an interest in this oil and gas accumulation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the protection and management of salmon stocks generally, my priority is to continue to progress my conservation and management strategies for the salmon resource.  The impact of the conservation measures which I renewed for 1998 has been to effectively reduce the commercial salmon season to the months of June and July.  I will be assessing the conservation <Col N="197" /> measures needed for 1999 in light of trends this year, with particular reference to concerns about the state of spring salmon stocks.  I am also looking at the introduction of a tagging and quota scheme in order to achieve real time management of salmon stocks on a shared resource basis. Finally, I have announced the establishment of a National Salmon Management Commission which will have a key role in delivering the new regime and all the related decisions underpinning that approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 114 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The status of the main commercially exploited stocks of fish and shellfish off the Irish coast and within EU waters generally is assessed annually by the relevant national scientists within a number of working groups under the aegis of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES.  ICES's Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management, ACFM, reviews the reports of the various working groups and a composite report is subsequently presented to the European Community's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF.  The working group reports and ACFM review inform the STECF's proposals to the European Commission on total allowable catches, TACS, and quotas.</P>
      <P>I understand that the various ICES working groups have completed their 1998 deliberations and that the ACFM and STECF will commence their reviews shortly.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Fisheries Research Centre of the Marine Institute to prepare, on the basis of the ICES and STECF reports, a summary review of the status of the fish stocks of interest to Ireland.  I will arrange for a copy of that review to be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The indications are that the scientific advice in relation to a number of fish stocks is extremely pessimistic this year.  It can be expected that reductions in TACs and quotas for 1999 will be proposed by the EU Commission in the annual negotiations on TACs and quotas at the December Fisheries Council. I will be seeking to achieve a balance at Council between maximising the fishing possibilities for Ireland next year, while ensuring that conservation objectives are met through the setting of sustainable TACS, geared to protecting the long-term viability of stocks.  I have also been working at EU level to improve control and enforcement.  New control measures are presently being finalised which will strengthen the existing control and enforcement regime. New technical measures to protect juvenile stocks have also been agreed by Council.  I assure the Deputy that I am working on all fronts to achieve the protection of fish stocks around our coast in order that the future of fishermen and communities dependent on fishing is secured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the names of companies exploring for petroleum and minerals is a matter of public record.  I report the positions by means of half yearly reports, one relating to oil and gas, the other to minerals, laid before each House of the Oireachtas in respect of the six months ending 30 June or 31 December in accordance with requirements laid down by the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995.  I refer the Deputy to the reports covering the period 1 January 1998-30 June 1998 which are in the Library.</P>
      <P>To bring the Deputy up to date since 30 June, I can advise that licences shown in the report as being held by Irish Gold Company, Rossmore Deep Mines Limited and jointly by Glencar Exploration Limited and Andamam Resources Limited have either expired and not been renewed or have been surrendered.  In addition to over 20 licences issued to existing licensees, new licensees are Nickelodeon Limited and Ormonde Brick Limited.  Other licences are in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>The question of whether indications are promising in relation to minerals is one of commercial decision by the licence holder as is the decision on when to make a public statement in relation to any particular prospect.</P>
      <P>To bring the Deputy up to date since 30 June, I can advise that one petroleum exploration licence shown in the report as held by BHP Petroleum (International Exploration) Pty Limited has now expired.</P>
      <P>I attach considerable importance to efforts being made to establish further Irish petroleum production.  Currently there are, 25 petroleum exploration licences on issue each of which carries a specific work programme.  Whereas I recognise the capabilities and commitment of companies exploring offshore Ireland at present, the fact that the price of oil is low and projected to remain so for the immediate future does not help in the high risk frontier areas off our west coast.  Nevertheless I am hopeful that the number of licences will increase when the applications for the frontier licensing round in the South Porcupine Basin, to be submitted by the closing date on 15 December this year, are assessed and awards made in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant events this year include two in relation to hydrocarbon accumulations.  In the case of the Corrib gas accumulation off the Mayo coast, Enterprise Oil and partners Saga and Statoil, reported favourable results from the appraisal well test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day.  It <Col N="200" /> is too early at this stage to give any meaningful indication of the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be able to do so until they have fully evaluated the accumulation.  This will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and is expected to include the drilling of additional appraisal wells.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Helvick field, I have granted a petroleum lease to Providence Resources PLC which is valid for a period of ten years from 1 May 1998.  The field is situated in the south-west corner of Block 49/9 in the North Celtic Sea Basin about 36 kilometres around the Waterford coast.  Providence has indicated that it believes that Helvick has an estimated seven million barrels of recoverable oil together with associated gas.  In assessing the application for a petroleum lease, I considered that while Helvick was a small field, potential for a commercial development had been established.  Under the terms of the lease, the company is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field for my approval by 1 May 2000.</P>

It manages and operates three co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head, County Donegal and Valentia, <Col N="201" /> County Kerry, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 50 coastal emergency response stations.  The IMES operates two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>In addition to its own resources, a number of declared resources which include the RNLI lifeboats around the coast, six community inshore rescue service boats and two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner, County Donegal and Waterford Regional Airport.  All of these resources are declared and available to IMES on a 24 hour basis all year round.</P>
      <P>The IMES delivers an effective 24 hour 365 day a year marine emergency service which meets the State's responsibilities for the provision of the most appropriate response to marine search and rescue, marine pollution, marine casualty and salvage within Ireland's international search and rescue region and pollution responsibility zones which includes its territorial seas and inland waters. The service provides for alert, notification, planning, co-ordination or control of marine emergency response and the provision of information to relatives, authorities and the public.</P>
      <P>A review of the functions and organisation of the IMES is currently under way in my Department.

      <P>While a substantial programme of improvements and refurbishment has been undertaken at fishery harbours in recent years, there are significant further development and upgrading needs at a range of key locations around the coast.  These requirements will be addressed in the fishery harbour development programmes for 1999 and subsequent years, and in the preparations for the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the catches of fishing vessels from other member states in the Irish fisheries zone.</P>
      <P>I should explain that this zone is not currently used as a basis for fisheries statistics, catch data or stock assessments.  These data are compiled by individual member states, including Ireland, for their own fleets by reference to the ICES Fishery Zones rather than national zones.</P>
      <P>The basis for firm estimates of catches in Irish waters by vessels from other member states is not, therefore, currently available.  I am strongly of the view, however, that achieving a better level of data on all catches in Irish waters is an essential objective.  The EU should develop a reliable common data base on all aspects of EU fisheries including stocks, catches, landings and sales.  This is essential management information, and is particularly critical for Ireland as a coastal state with a high level of fishing activity by other member states in our waters.</P>
      <P>Based on the data sources available, it is estimated that approximately one million metric tonnes of fish with a first sale value of some £700 million are caught annually in the Irish zone.  The value of the Irish fleet catch as a component of this is over £150 million.</P>
      <P>This is an indicative estimate only for the reasons I have outlined.  I have asked my Department to work with the Marine Institute and BIM to review available data and develop methodologies which would further quantify existing estimates of catches in the Irish zone.  I will also press at EU level for the development of the necessary data bases by the commission with the co-operation of all member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current fish landings within the EU are insufficient to meet the European Community's consumer and processing industry demand.  The Community is, therefore, heavily dependent on imported fish to meet domestic demand and is, in fact, the world's largest importer of edible fish products.  It is unlikely that the level of EU landings and-or consumer preferences will change to such an extent as to diminish greatly this dependency and the Community will remain, therefore, a net importer of fisheries products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of future fish landings is dependent on a range of factors, such as trade liberalisation, the globalisation of the world market, consumer preferences etc., which influence supply.  The <Col N="203" /> Deputy refers specifically to the status of fish stocks as a determinant of supply.</P>
    <P>The status of the main commercially exploited stocks of fish within EU waters generally is assessed annually by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES.  ICES's Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management, ACFM, reviews the reports of the various working groups and a composite report is subsequently presented to the European Community's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF.  I understand that the various ICES working groups have completed their 1998 deliberations and that the ACFM and STECF will commence their reviews shortly.  These reviews provide forecasts of future stock levels on the basis of which future landings can be estimated.</P>
    <P>As the EU is a net importer of fish products, future fish supplies to the community will also depend on the status of fish stocks in non-EU waters.  A number of international fisheries organisations, such as the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, NAFO, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, NEAFC, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, ICCAT, also carry out stock assessments and these need to be considered in any examination of future landings.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Fisheries Research Centre of the Marine Institute to prepare, on the basis of the ICES and STECF reports, a summary review of the status of all fish stocks of interest to Ireland.  I will arrange for a copy of that review to be made available to the Deputy together with information on stocks outside EU waters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware that rules introduced under the Common Fisheries Policy are designed to ensure a steady supply of fisheries products.  Under these rules the EC operates an intervention system to support prices in Community markets and to regulate the disparities between supply and demand.  These intervention mechanisms include financial compensation for the withdrawal from sale of products the prices for which reach or fall below the withdrawal level, special financial compensation for exceptionally large withdrawals and carry-over aid in respect of the temporary withdrawal of products from the market.  The Community also uses a system of preferential tariffs to ensure continuity of supply.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible, through the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 for the funding of research and development programmes for the marine sector. Total expenditure on research and development under this programme will amount to £8 million approximately and of this £2.56 million will be spent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Research and development under the Operational Programme for Fisheries focuses on the key areas of fisheries and aquaculture, national marine survey, marine technology development, and marine food processing.  Funding under the programme has supported the acquisition of the first purpose-built Irish marine research vessel, <i>Celtic Voyager.</i>  The vessel was delivered in August 1997 costing £2.1 million over two years, is under the management of the marine institute, and undertakes research on oceanography, fish stocks, marine environment and technology for fishing gear.  In addition the vessel is available to public bodies, the private sector and universities for research purposes.</P>
      <P>Funding under the programme is also supporting significant upgrading of marine research laboratories. Two million pounds of the marine research measure has been allocated to the provision and upgrading of marine research laboratories with a statutory function.  Three projects will be funded under this sub-measure before the end of the programme in 1999.  An extension to laboratory facilities at the Fisheries Research Centre, Abbotstown has now been completed at a cost of £1.25 million.  Work has commenced on the construction of a technical support base in Galway in August of this year.  Five hundred thousands pounds of marine research measure funds has been allocated to this project which will be completed in January 1999 and £250,000 has been allocated to the Salmon Research Agency in Newport for upgrading of their laboratories; work is due to commence in late 1998.</P>
      <P>Funding is also provided by my Department for research undertaken by the marine institute and the Salmon Research Agency.  The Marine Institute carries out essential programmes to underpin management decisions and policy including fish stocks assessment, aquaculture research, fish health and marine environmental issues.  The Salmon Research Agency is focused on research activities such as the selective breeding of salmonids, rearing techniques and census work on wild populations.  Funding for research by the two bodies amounts to £2.982 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>Specific research on matters relevant to their remit is also undertaken by a number of other agencies under my Department's aegis, including Bord Iascaigh Mhara; such as fishing gear technology, food processing, aquaculture techniques; and the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, water quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 the Marine Institute completed a comprehensive assessment of the research and <Col N="205" /> development needs of the fisheries and aquaculture, tourism and marine technology sectors. This report &ldquo;A Marine Research, Technology Development and Innovative Strategy &mdash; A National Team Approach&rdquo; was approved by Cabinet in July and launched by me in September 1998.  The report sets out specific research and development priorities to be achieved over the next five years in order to support and develop the sectors identified.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that targeted applied research and development is essential to ensuring that Ireland realises the development potential consistent with sustainability from its natural resources.  Current levels of funding support significant research and development programmes. It will be one of my priorities as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that, in the context of the overall national policy on science, technology and innovation, adequate resources are available for research and development which support the ongoing development of the marine and natural resources sectors.  It is also a priority for me to ensure that the ongoing development of the sectors for which my Department is responsible, including the fishing industry, is underpinned by well-focused value for money programmes of research and development including maximising opportunities under EU funded science and technology programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 125, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the International Forestry Stewardship Council's role in accreditation and that the issues of certification has been discussed in the context of the UK forestry standard prepared <Col N="206" /> by the UK Forestry Commission and the forest service of the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland.  Environmental accreditation schemes work on the basis of voluntary undertakings by producers to reassure consumers as to the environmental quality of its products.  I am not in a position to recommend any particular scheme. However, the representatives of the Forestry Stewardship Council in Ireland will be aware of the Government's commitment to the development of sustainable forestry which is compatible with the protection of the environment, subject to guidelines, codes of best forest practice and the law.  Any accreditation scheme which takes on board Government policy on sustainable forestry should pose no problems to Irish forest products.</P>
    <P>The European Union support the principle of sustainable forest management.  The issue of certification is under debate at EU level.  While there is no EU policy on certification at the moment, indications are that the EU would prefer to see a framework approach for accreditation rather than specify any particular accreditation scheme such as that of the International Forestry Stewardship Council.</P>
    <P>While the Government is committed to ensuring that Irish timber conforms to the highest standards, I do not have a day-to-day responsibility in respect of individual forest products companies.  I have not received any reports as to a forest company losing orders on the international market because of the lack of international recognised accreditation in relation to its products.</P>

      <P>The Government fully share the concerns which have been expressed in the letter from the pastoral council to which the Deputy refers.  These concerns focus on the need to help the people of Sudan and to bring our influence to bear in support of a lasting and just peace.</P>
      <P>Through humanitarian assistance to the stricken people of Sudan, the Government is giving practical expression to the concerns of the signatories of the petitions.  Our ongoing co-operation with Trócaire and other NGOs in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan also reflects our commitment.  Overall emergency assistance from the Government to Sudan amounts to £1.4 million so far this year.</P>

    <P>The Government fully accepts the need also to <Col N="207" /> bring about peace with justice for the benefit of the people of Sudan.  This was a central issue during my visit to Sudan in August when I pursued it with the Khartoum Government, the SPLA and leading figures in the regional peace initiative for Sudan of the East African <i>Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD.</i> Both bilaterally and also together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, we are actively pressing the conflicting parties for an early resumption of the political talks process. We fully recognise that humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for a meaningful and inclusive political solution.

      <P>A table of my intended foreign travel plans for the next 12 months follows for the information of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>This is necessarily provisional as it is not possible, at this stage, to anticipate the circumstances which will require me to travel abroad over the year ahead. investment linked citizenship by naturalisation scheme which was administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform until the scheme was abolished by the Government in April 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proof of Irish citizenship is required for the issue of all Irish passports.  In the case of naturalised citizens, including those granted citizenship under the investment-linked scheme, Certificates of Naturalisation issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, must be produced before passports are issued.  The function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, through its <Col N="209" /> Passport Office, once proof of citizenship is established, is to issue the passport.</P>
    <P>The Passport Office is not provided with details of foreign nationals to whom certificates of naturalisation are issued and cannot therefore distinguish between certificates issued under the investment-linked scheme and those issued to other naturalised citizens.  As it is not possible to identify passport holders solely on the basis of how citizenship was acquired the Passport Office is not in a position to provide the information requested.</P>

      <P>Peatlands account for approximately 11,757 square kilometres or 17.2 per cent of the land area of the Republic of Ireland.  Irish peatlands generally fall into three principal types: raised bogs, blanket bogs, and fens.</P>
      <P>Raised bogs occur extensively across the central midland plain.  Blanket bogs are found along the western seaboard, and also on higher hills and mountain areas.  Fens occur in river valleys and floodplains, often in close association with raised bogs.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna owns 83,000 hectares of bog in Ireland or 7 per cent of the peatland mass which is suitable for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna currently supplies approximately three million tonnes of milled peat to ESB for electricity generation.  This is expected to rise to around 3.9 million tonnes for a short period in the early years of the next decade when the new 120MW peat plant at Edenderry comes on <Col N="210" /> stream.  The board currently also produces around one million tonnes of milled peat annually for its horticulture and briquette businesses.</P>
    <P>Based on existing and foreseeable rates of extraction, the remaining peat reserves of Bord na Móna are estimated by the board to be sufficient for another 30 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>Definitive figures for private peat production are not available but it is estimated that between 1.2 and 1.5 million tonnes of sod turf are now produced annually.</P>

The report to the steering group on the review of the Irish Naval Service and Air Corps which was published earlier this year also recommended that the Army support squadron should be relocated from Gormanston Air Station to Baldonnel.

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect, the regulations required that a comparison be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Under the regulation only money recouped from farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes could be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.  As the number of eligible animals qualifying for premium under the 1996 schemes exceeded the number qualifying under the 1995 schemes the rates for payment had to be adjusted downwards accordingly.  The person named had six eligible animals for payment under the 1995 suckler cow scheme and 14 under the 1996 scheme.  He was paid top-up amounting to £57.92 in respect of the eight additional animals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>An application was lodged under the suckler cow premium scheme in respect of 20 animals by the person named on 28 May 1997.  On checking my Department was not satisfied that the person named operated a separate holding from that of her husband in 1997.  Both the person named and her husband were informed of the findings by letter on 20 March 1998.  As a milk quota in excess of the 25,637 gallon limit was attached to the holding, the person named could not qualify for suckler cow premium grants in 1997.</P>
      <P>The matter was appealed in April 1998.  Subsequently a suckler cow application was lodged in May.  At a meeting with Department officials on 26 June she was advised of the reasons for amalgamation of the two herds and accepted the decision and consequently withdrew her application for 1998 suckler cow premium.</P>
      <P>A 1997 extensification premium grant for £1,306.87 issued to the person named on 8 October 1998.  The payment was in respect of 32 animals grant aided under the special beef premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners have also advised me that, on the basis of the limited information currently available to them regarding this case, it is unclear whether rollover relief would be available to the vendor.  The legislation in relation to rollover relief sets out detailed rules in relation to the availability of the relief and includes restrictions on the relief in cases such as the current one involving disposals of development land.  There is nothing in the legislation providing for rollover relief in situations where the land disposed of is used for community development purposes.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the growing concern at the fall in deposit rates; the level of DIRT collected per year; and if he will assist mainly elderly people living on deposit savings by introducing measures including removal of DIRT on special savings accounts, for elderly people over 65 and reducing DIRT to its original 5 per cent rate for all or at least for the elderly.</Quest>

      <P>DIRT at 20 per cent or 24 per cent is the collection mechanism by which tax is withheld at source on <Col N="218" /> deposit interest and in all cases is a final liability tax on such interest income.  The yield from DIRT net of refunds, was £148 million in 1997 and is an important source of Exchequer revenue. I have no plans to cut the rate of DIRT on interest income in the circumstances of falling interest rates.  Naturally any further cuts in the standard rate of income tax, now 24 per cent, will be reflected in the standard rate of DIRT.</P>
      <P>Regarding the situation of the elderly in relation to DIRT, the over-65's are one of only two categories of individuals entitled to a refund of DIRT paid if their income is below the income tax exemption thresholds.  Concessionary treatment is, therefore, afforded to the elderly in the administration of DIRT where their incomes fall outside the tax net.  It is a general principle of taxation that as far as possible income from all sources should be subjected to taxation.</P>
      <P>DIRT receipts for 1986 to 1997 are set out below for each calendar year.</P>

      <Quest>the scale for probate tax and inheritance tax which may apply in a case of a house jointly owned by three members of a family in equal shares where the two unmarried siblings have died during 1998, the house automatically goes to the only surviving member who has not lived there recently and the value of the house is £115,000.</Quest>

      <P>Probate tax is charged at a rate of 2 per cent on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased, whether the assets pass under a will or intestacy. Property not passing under a will or intestacy, for example, jointly held property is not within the scope of probate tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the information outlined above and assuming that the individuals involved did not take any other gifts or inheritances since 2 June 1982, the following is the position with regard to inheritance tax.  Inheritances or gifts taken from a sibling can avail of the Class 11 threshold of £25,120.  On the death of the first sibling the two surviving siblings each inherited a one sixth share <Col N="219" /> of the house by survivorship, worth £19,167. Consequently, no inheritance tax would have been due in respect of this inheritance.</P>
    <P>On the death of the second sibling, the surviving sibling at that stage inherits a half share of the house by survivorship.  The half share is worth £57,500.  The surviving sibling is liable to inheritance tax on the aggregate of the first and second inheritances with credit given for any tax already paid.</P>
    <P>The tax on the inheritance of £76,667 is calculated as follows:</P>

The existing concession is authorised by reference to an EU Council decision which authorises member states to continue to apply existing reductions in rates of excise duty, but not new reductions.  Whether the EU Commission and Council would be prepared to extend or interpret this existing concession to fuels such as petrol or LPG would have to be explored.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the methadone protocol implementation committee, which is working closely with the Eastern Health Board in encouraging general practitioners to become involved in the treatment of drug misusers.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is also represented on the committee and the college fully endorses the methadone protocol and actively promotes it in its policy on drug abuse.  The Eastern Health Board employs general practitioners in its treatment centres and satellite clinics.  Public advertisements are placed on a regular basis to attract additional general practitioners to work in the service.  In addition, the board employs co-ordinators whose role includes placing drug misusers who have been stabilised in the board's treatment facilities with general practitioners in their own local areas.</P>
      <P>Arising from the full implementation of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, on 1 October new controls are in place for the prescribing and dispensing of methadone.  Limits have also been placed on the numbers of drug misusers attending individual general practitioners and pharmacies, In addition, agreement has been reached with the professional organisations representing general practitioners and pharmacists on appropriate levels of remuneration for those participating in the methadone protocol.  I am confident that the implementation of these measures will result in the recruitment of additional general practitioners and pharmacists into the treatment of drug misusers.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on Health and Personal Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of services, including respite care services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each health board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for these services in 1998.  Of this, £1.08 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board, to which £200,000 has been allocated by the board to respite care in the physical and sensory disability sector.  The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998, is £8.4 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.  When account is taken of the additional £10 million I made available for these services in late 1997, it will be noted that I have made available additional funding of £18.4 million for these services in the last 12 months.  This compares with £3,695 million allocated under the previous administration in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides <Col N="222" /> information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places during the period 1997-2001.  It is estimated that the revenue cost of providing the required services will be in the region of £63.5 million over the period.  The Government's commitment to meeting this cost is clearly set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I have also put in place a major £30 million four year national capital programme, commencing this year, to provide the volume and quality of facilities required to provide these new services, including respite services, and which will run in tandem with the implementation of the needs outlined in the Assessment of Need.  I recently provided further capital funding of £5 million on top of the £30 million national capital programme.  This allocation brings the amount of additional funding allocated by me in the last 12 months to £25 million This compares with £12 million allocated under the previous administration in 1997, the first year of the Assessment of Need.</P>
    <P>In respect of respite services to persons with a mental handicap in the eastern region, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that 770 people availed of respite care in 1997 and that since 1991 around 200 additional respite places have been provided throughout the Eastern Health Board region.  The precise services to be developed in the eastern region is based on the priorities which have been identified by the central mental handicap planning committee.  I am satisfied that this funding will significantly advance the progress which is being made in developing the services as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board in its service plan for 1998 identified Ringsend/Irishtown and Rathmines as areas requiring drug treatment facilities to cater for drug misusers from these areas who were in need of treatment.  A service commenced in Rathmines Health Centre on 15 October 1998.  This clinic will take up to 20 patients when fully operational.  A service in Ringsend/Irishtown has not commenced to date. It is planned to provide a service in the Ringsend health centre in the near future where the anticipated numbers attending would be in the region of 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the difficulties encountered by the health board in its attempts <Col N="223" /> to expand the range of treatment facilities to meet the needs of drug misusers.  The board was required, arising from the full implementation of the methadone protocol, to put in place certain emergency measures, including the provision of services at certain health centres, to meet the demand for such services.  I appreciate that this has caused unease in some local communities.  I can appreciate the apprehension which some communities may feel but I would appeal for support for the board's efforts to respond to this serious social problem.  I fully support the board's approach and I believe that the provision of these facilities for drug misusers in their own localities will have a positive effect in the longer term.</P>

      <P>Independent midwives operating in the community provide care to mothers who wish to give birth at home.  Departmental policy in relation to home births is informed by the report of the mother and infant care review group which was circulated to interested parties in April 1997.  This report gives a strong endorsement to the policy that the safest place to have a baby is in a well-equipped and staffed maternity hospital or unit. Submissions to the review group suggested that one of the main reasons why women opt to give birth at home is their desire for a positive experience in friendly, familiar surroundings where they retain full control.  In response to this, the review group recommended that certain approaches be pilot tested such as (i) the setting aside of accommodation in a maternity hospital to facilitate delivery in a homely, non-clinical manner, and (ii) a domiciliary care in and out of hospital &mdash; DOMINO &mdash; approach which would allow the midwife/general practitioner to monitor the mother throughout her pregnancy, be with her in hospital and to continue to provide care on her return home.</P>
      <P>The report recognised that arrangements must be made to cater for those women who wish to give birth at home and an expert group has been established under the chief executive officers of the health boards to pilot the approaches suggested by the review group and to draw up procedures and protocols on home births.  I understand that this group is due to present its report shortly.</P>

It would not be appropriate for me therefore to set specific limits in respect of the life span of fire appliances. Fire appliances are generally constructed on commercial vehicle chassis and generally comply with the Joint Committee for Design and Development &mdash; JCDD 1 &mdash; U.K. standards.  Fire appliances are subject to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1998 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1996.  While fire appliances are not currently required to be tested under the compulsory vehicle testing scheme, it is the intention to include them in the scheme at an early date.  All fire appliances are assessed for road worthiness during regular maintenance.  The position in relation to the emergency ambulance service is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children and I have no function in this regard.</P>

      <P>Changing our ways, the policy statement on waste management published recently by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recognises that a key factor in mobilising the public to take a more responsible approach to waste, and support its minimisation and recovery, is sustained public information and education.  Local authorities have a critical role in influencing change in their communities and securing a better performance in relation to the minimisation and recovery of waste.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities are already engaged in local environmental awareness campaigns, and the policy statement strongly recommends that those authorities which have not already done so should develop an on-going public awareness programme aimed at generating a clear appreciation of the nature and scale of the waste problem in their area, and providing practical guidance on the day to day choices which can be exercised by individuals and households.</P>
      <P>Meaningful waste charging policies also play an important role in influencing public behaviour in favour of waste minimisation.  By ensuring that waste generators, including households, pay the full costs of waste services on a use-related basis, local authorities can focus public attention on the implications of waste generation and provide a direct economic incentive for waste reduction. &ldquo;Changing our ways&rdquo; recommends that local authorities introduce weight related charging to the fullest extent possible.  Public education on waste and other environmental issues is routinely promoted through my Department's environmental information office, ENFO.  A number of the environmental awareness projects supported this year under my Department's environmental partnership fund grants scheme involve the promotion of waste reduction among local communities.</P>

The contract documents are currently being prepared by the local authority for the main scheme. Fingal County Council is obliged to obtain a foreshore licence before construction can commence on the advance element of the scheme, and in this regard, an application was submitted to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, who have recently issued a draft licence to the council for its consideration.  It is expected that construction will commence before the end of the year on the advance section.  Construction is scheduled to last six months.  It is expected that construction will commence on the main scheme in 1999, with completion scheduled for 2001.</P>

      <P>The general situation is that if land currently used as a public park is to be used for development, then the development plan would have to be varied accordingly. The usual procedures, involving public consultation etc., in relation to the variation of a plan would have to be followed.  Any rezoning could also be made in reviewing a development plan.</P>
      <P>Whether such a change of zoning would be sufficient in itself to procure such a change of use depends on the particular circumstances of the public park in question.  If the park was governed by particular statutory provisions it may require legislation.  If the land was gifted to a local authority for use as a public park, it is possible that the use of the land for other purposes would be restricted by the terms of the gift.  However, if the land was acquired by compulsory purchase for use as a public park, then it is possible that the local authority could designate the land for another use.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have general powers, under the Local Government Act, 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes but no specific procedures are laid down for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance rate less £6.</P>
      <P>This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.  The SWA rate for an adult is £68.40 per week.  Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The limits are set by the health board using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable <Col N="230" /> rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area.  Health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within these limits.</P>
    <P>Health boards must be satisfied that the rent payable by the applicant is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence and is reasonable having regard to the applicant's residential needs.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the last few years.  This was mainly due to increases in rent levels rather than recipient numbers.  In July 1996, following the publication of the housing review group report, an interdepartmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to the local authorities.  It comprises of representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance as well Environment and Local Government. I understand the committee will report shortly.</P>
    <P>The following tabular statement sets out the amount of rent subsidy paid by the Eastern Health Board.  Information prior to 1994 is estimated and information for 1998 is only available to July 1998.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, my Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>Applications for this scheme are being considered in the regional offices of my Department, which process applications under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I confirm that an application has been received from the group mentioned in the Deputy's question. My Department expects to be in a position to advise the group of the decision regarding its application under the scheme in the near future.</P>

Abbey Loughrea which is known as Kilnalekin Friary does not satisfy these criteria.  In addition, the abbey is a single storey structure only, whilst being within a graveyard where it would be difficult to site the lighting.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that I have recently received representations from the school referred to by the Deputy in relation to the points raised in the Deputy's question.  The submission is being considered by officials within my Department and a response to the points raised in the submission will be communicated to the school shortly.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  In the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
      <P>However, since coming to Office last year, I have made a number of changes which have improved the funding and staffing situation in schools.  With regard to funding, the 1998 Estimates provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education over the 1997 budget allocation.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of caretaking and clerical assistance, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>The priority has been to extend the scheme to include schools which have no provision for these services already rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil £15 per pupil in respect of each service.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure to the current figure of 195 pupils.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the school referred to by the Deputy does not qualify for an additional capitation grant for either clerical or caretaking services at this stage as its enrolment of 102 pupils is well below the qualifying threshold.</P>
      <P>On the question of teacher supply, I have implemented a broad range of measures to increase the supply of fully trained teachers, including significantly increasing the intake into the colleges of education.  This year alone, I ensured that over 1,000 places were available within the colleges of education.  I intend to maintain this high intake level over the next few years.</P>
      <P>I have decided that, from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> In the circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will agree that the introduction of the above measures is indicative of the high priority the Government attaches to primary education, and clearly demonstrates its intent to honour its commitments in relation to this sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector subject to regular review.  As a response to the higher education needs of the south east region, the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to Regional Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Since the report of the steering committee was published the number of full-time students in the institute has increased from the 1994-5 level of 3,500 to 4,740 in 1997-8.</P>
      <P>An increase in degree level provision has been sanctioned by my Department in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology in the context of meeting the identified higher education needs of the south east region.  The following is a list of degree level courses sanctioned since 1995: BA in Applied Social Studies, B Sc in Applied Biology, BA in Legal and Business Studies, BA in Applied Languages, BSc in Commercial Software Development, BA in Financial Services, BA in General and Corporate Administration, BA in Accounting, BSc in Manufacturing Systems Engineering, and B Eng in Electronic Engineering. The institute submitted to my Department a framework for its development and this proposal is the subject of ongoing negotiations with officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early in 1997, the institute was redesignated as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements have been put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards, within a national qualifications framework.  This process <Col N="238" /> is being carried out by an interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly.  I understand that the interim review group has completed a draft report on the self-evaluation study by Waterford Institute of Technology and has furnished the institute with its observations on the study and its draft recommendations.  At present the group is considering the response from Waterford to these observations and draft recommendations prior to finalising its report which will then be submitted to me.</P>
    <P>A number of significant capital projects are currently under way in the institute including a new library-information resource centre for which approval to award a construction contract has recently been given by my Department.  In addition, I have also given approval to the institute to appoint a design team in respect of a new tourism-CERT training facility.  These and other important capital developments represent a major and tangible investment in the future of the institute and its student body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of complaints concerning management issues at Carndonagh community school.  These complaints related to the level of financial accountability to the board and the accuracy of returns of pupil enrolments submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>Community schools are established under a deed of trust and managed by an 11 member board of management separate from my Department. The board comprises three representatives of the religious communities, three representatives of the vocational education committee and two parent and two teacher representatives.  The principal teacher of the school is a non voting member of the board of management.  My Department is not represented on the board. Each board is responsible for the governance and direction of the school and for the procedures in place to inform board members concerning the affairs of the school.  My Department provides guidance to boards in relation to school management generally and it also supports initiatives taken by the representative management body for boards &mdash; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &mdash; in this regard so as to ensure that best practice obtains.  Where internal board difficulties arise, these fall to be dealt with by the board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaints received concerning Carndonagh community school were referred to the board of management for its consideration and report to the Department.  The board responded stating <Col N="240" /> that it was satisfied with the accountability arrangements in place at the school.</P>
    <P>In March 1995, the school informed my Department of an error in the return of enrolments submitted for 1994-95 which resulted in an overstatement of pupils attending the school.  This error was the result of inadequate checking of the return before it was submitted to my Department. The board was reminded of its obligations to ensure that such returns are accurate and complete. Roll keeping procedures have been reviewed on a number of occasions since then and my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of pupil returns.</P>
    <P>My Department's internal audit unit visited the school in May 1996 to examine its operations and procedures and prepared a report on its findings. The board of management, was requested to consider the report and outline the measures being taken to address weaknesses identified in the school's systems.  Following two further visits in 1997, the internal audit unit confirmed that progress was being made in upgrading procedures at the school but further work was required in a number of areas.  Outside accounting expertise was also sanctioned for the school.</P>
    <P>My Department has also met with members of the board in 1997 and 1998 and outlined to them the board's responsibilities for the overall management of the school and the need for improved procedures.  Guidance has been given to the board in relation to good management practice generally.</P>
    <P>The complaints made did not refer to any impropriety on the part of school management and my Department's inquiries have not uncovered any evidence in this regard.  The school has co-operated fully with my Department's inquiries and the board has undertaken to accept and implement the internal audit unit's recommendations.  However, a number of issues remain to be resolved and my Department will continue to monitor progress at the school in consultation with the board of management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 209 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that my Department has carried out an architectural assessment of the school referred to by the Deputy and accepts that the existing accommodation needs to be upgraded. The means by which this can be achieved are currently being examined.  When a mutually acceptable solution has been agreed, the question of funding can then be addressed.</P>

      <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs, the Murray report, made proposals in October 1996 for the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  With effect from 1 January 1998, five scheduled urban district vocational education committees have been amalgamated with their respective county VECs.</P>
      <P>The strengthening of vocational education is an important part of my agenda and I am committed to full consultations with all contributors to this sector on any further initiatives in this area.

      <Quest>if he will postpone the midterm break in the school term by one week until early November in view of the fact it gives students one week off to collect bonfire material which causes problems and nuisance for residents, Garda authorities and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce new procedures for dealing with schools' timetabling arrangements.</P>
      <P>The position at primary level regarding school breaks is that all schools must close for the months of July and August.  Outside of these times school authorities have discretion in relation to planning their school breaks provided they comply with the requirement to be in operation for a minimum of 183 days in the school year.</P>
      <P>At second level, schools are required to be open for teaching for 167 days.  Subject to this requirement being met, the choice of vacation days on which schools will be closed is a matter for individual school management authorities.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that its school is in operation for the prescribed minimum number of days, each management authority, in planning the school year, must make allowance for days on which the school may have to be closed due to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.  School authorities must therefore retain discretion in relation to timetabling matters.</P>
      <P>It is open to any individual or group to raise their concerns about the scheduling of school breaks with the relevant school authorities.</P>

      <P>This year in a major new initiative I provided an opportunity for leaving certificate students to view their marked scripts under supervision.</P>
      <P>In the initial year of operation, due to reservations held by some of the interested parties, it was not possible to make the scripts available in subjects which involved a practical or oral component. For that reason the scripts in Irish and French would not have been available to the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> I did undertake to make scripts in those subjects available for viewing, on demand, to those students who sought a recheck, after the recheck process had concluded.  However, as the student in question did not appeal his results in either <Col N="244" /> Irish or French, it is not open to him to view those particular scripts.</P>
    <P>The far reaching and innovative arrangements which I have put in place do not extend to providing candidates with photocopies of their examination scripts.</P>
