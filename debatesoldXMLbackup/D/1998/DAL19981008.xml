      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Owen, Joe Higgins, Quinn and Rabbitte.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call on Deputy Owen to state the matter of which she gave me notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the extraordinary allegations in <i>Magill</i> magazine concerning the relationship and settlements between the Revenue Commissioners and Allied Irish Banks on the taxation liability on non-resident accounts; the alleged agreement between the commissioners and the bank concerning non-prosecution and secrecy; and any further investigations by the commissioners into this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matters of urgent public importance; the revelation of large-scale tax evasion by Allied Irish Banks; the alleged writing off of evaded taxes by the Revenue Commissioners; whether Ministers in the present or previous Administrations were aware of this scandal; whether political representations were made to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of Allied Irish Banks and whether large-scale financial contributions by Allied Irish Banks to major political parties in this State were in any way connected to the alleged settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the business of the House to discuss a matter <Col N="1438" /> of immediate and fundamental importance, the failure of the Central Bank to inform the Government of the extent of bogus non-resident accounts being held in Irish banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the excessively lenient settlement terms arrived at between the Revenue Commissioners and the associated banks in question in respect of unpaid tax liabilities, arrears and penalties due by the banks to this State; and the subsequent excessive tax burden which compliant taxpayers were obliged to carry during this period of tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31, I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest: reports that Allied Irish Banks gave false information to the Revenue Commissioners about the extent of bogus non-residential accounts, thus evading tax liability to the State; the extent, if any, to which the Revenue Commissioners agreed to write off taxes legally due; the role of the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank in the supervision of banks at the relevant time; and the implications of these allegations for compliant taxpayers and the tax system generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 18, Western Development Commission Bill, 1998 &mdash;&mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 3, Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Bill, 1998 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that any division demanded today on the Second Stage of No. 18 or No. 3 shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 13 October 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one proposal to put to the House, the proposal for dealing with the postponement of any division.  Is that proposal agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree the Order of Business, will the Tánaiste give an undertaking that the Minister for Finance will respond here today to these very serious allegations made about the Revenue Commissioners and the role of the Central Bank in regard to what, effectively, is a defrauding of the taxpayer?  This is a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsais De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is required to agree to a waiving of Standing Orders to facilitate the Government so that its Members do not have to vote on matters before the House today. Before we agree to facilitate the Government in this way, will the Tánaiste give an undertaking that the Minister for Finance will today facilitate the Opposition and the people by explaining why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that this House becomes irrelevant if a story that has broken in a short space of time before the Order of Business is agreed has to be raised here.  Will the Tánaiste indicate before we agree to today's Order of Business that she will ensure that the Government will allow time for this matter to be discussed in the House today?  Otherwise we will have to wait until next Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has everything to do with it because we will be bound by the Order of Business. If the Tánaiste were to agree to my suggestion, a time could be agreed by the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful to the House.  The Government is concerned about these matters, as are all Members of this House. Obviously, the Minister for Finance cannot attend because he is at the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste vary the schedule for an early discussion on this matter rather than leaving it as the last item of business today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Tánaiste has given a clear undertaking to the House that Private Notice Questions will be accepted by her on this matter and that a member of the Government will answer those questions?  Will there be an extended period of time, in so far as that is possible, for a debate this afternoon on the matter?  Is my interpretation of what the Tánaiste is offering correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if, as the Tánaiste suggested, the Whips agreed to make time available for statements by the Government and the Opposition parties on this matter, followed by questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Tánaiste is offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Private Notice Questions have been submitted to the Ceann Comhairle.  It is a matter for him whether to allow those questions.  If he allows them, the issue of statements does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste could take the initiative and offer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event that Private Notice Questions are not allowed, the Government is happy to facilitate statements.  The Revenue Commissioners are independent in the exercise of <Col N="1441" /> their functions.  The settlement to which reference has been made in recent days and which came to light in April this year was made under the regime of a different Government.  I make this point in case anybody is seeking to implicate the Government.</P>
      <P>However, the Government is concerned about the regulatory regime that applies to the financial services sector.  It appears there is over-concern with monetary and prudential matters to the detriment of everything else.  The Minister for Finance and I will shortly submit to the Government joint proposals on the need for an independent financial regulator.  Those proposals will be discussed by the Government shortly.  Deputies should be aware of this since it was the subject of some of the matters raised under Standing Order 31 this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Tánaiste offered a specific time during the day for a discussion on this matter.  However, she now appears to be falling back on the Ceann Comhairle's good will in terms of whether Private Notice Questions will be taken and suggesting that only then will the Government consider providing time.  I ask the Tánaiste to be proactive on this matter and change the Order of Business to allow time today for statements on this matter followed by questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is effectively discussing a change to the Order of Business.  If the Tánaiste if offering, subject to the details being worked out by the Whips, some time later today for statements by a relevant Minister with an opportunity for Opposition Deputies to respond, followed by questions and answers, a format which is familiar <Col N="1442" /> to the House, then we will agree to the proposal and to the altered Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I raised in the first place.  Will the Tánaiste provide time so the Government can explain the position, Opposition parties can have an opportunity to make statements and the Government can answer questions?  In the course of this discussion, the Tánaiste appears to have shifted towards Private Notice Questions, but that will not permit the Opposition to respond to the Government's statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to decide the rules of the House.  That is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.  I understand Private Notice Questions have been submitted and it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to decide whether to allow them.  If the Ceann Comhairle allows Private Notice Questions, the issue of statements does not arise.  If such questions are not allowed, the Government is happy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has responsibility for ordering business today on behalf of the Government. If she clearly indicated, subject to the detail being agreed by the Whips, that there will be statements and questions and answers on this issue, my interpretation of Standing Orders is that <Col N="1443" /> any Private Notice Questions would automatically fall since the matter in question was being dealt with by a superior order of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Tánaiste unequivocally states that it is the intention of the Government to order such time, the Chair is aware of its functions in relation to Private Notice Questions and that they automatically fall.  The debate subsumes the content of the questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate whether she will talk to the Whips immediately after the Order of Business and make an arrangement for statements at 12 noon, 2 p.m. or another time today?  The Tánaiste is aware that the Opposition must submit Private Notice Questions but it does not preclude the Government proactively making time available for a discussion.  The Private Notice Questions system is not satisfactory for the Opposition because we can only ask a few supplementaries before the Chair stops us.  The Minister can read a full reply but Opposition Members might only have the opportunity to ask two supplementary questions.</P>

    <Title>Western Development Commission Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Government for putting the Western Development Commission on to a statutory basis.  This is an indication of the Government's dedication to development in the west.  Until recently, there has been much discussion on the issue of Objective One status for the west and this has resulted in a great deal of media attention on the need for development in this area.  Those of us living in the west, however, have known for some time that the west has fallen behind both economically and socially. This was pointed out in the ESRI report published last December.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Western Development Commission which will cover the five counties of Connacht as well as Donegal and Clare.  I hope that when the board is set up, made up of a chairman and 11 members, each county will have a representative on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> A fund of £25 million has been allocated to the Western Development Commission &mdash; £2 million this year and £5 million next year, with the position being reviewed in 1999.  However, a sum of £25 million is a pittance when one considers the job that has to be done in the west.  Provided the money is distributed evenly over the seven counties, £2 million this year and £5 million next year will mean approximately £800,000 per county. When money is being spent and projects evaluated, I ask the Minister to consider distributing the money evenly among the seven counties because they are all in need of development in their own right.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the maximum amount of funding is £250,000 and that the decision to approve amounts above this figure can be referred to the Minister.  That is important because many worthy projects in the west involving job production may require more funds, including some jobs in relation to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be close liaison with all Government Departments, particularly with Ministers representing areas in the west.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, on getting this matter sorted out so quickly and bringing together the Ministers representing the west to enable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this legislation to be brought before the Dáil.  The dedication of the Minister of State in visiting various counties in the west over the past months is an indication of the Government's commitment in this regard. Unfortunately, the previous Government talked a great deal about the problem but did not get around to addressing it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Objective One status is the most important issue to those of us in the west.  It has been given much media attention but a great deal of misinformation has been disseminated on this issue.  The facts are simple.  In the west, along with the Northern and midlands counties, our income <i>per capita</i> expressed in GDP terms is less than 75 per cent of the EU average.  Under EU rules, therefore, we qualify for Objective One status.  On the eastern side of the country, particularly in Dublin, income per capita, again expressed in GDP terms, is 111 per cent of the EU average.  On simple mathematics that region cannot qualify for Objective One status in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dividing the country into two regions, we are not taking anything away from the eastern area. I object to the attacks made by Deputies representing that area when they say we are creating a rural-urban divide.  I worked in Dublin for ten years and I am aware there are blackspots in the city, but with an income <i>per capita</i> of 68 per cent of the EU average, the west has many blackspots <Col N="1449" /> also.  In my county incomes would be at a much lower rate.  Counties like Galway, for example, have prospered over the years but counties like Mayo have fallen behind.  I do not deny that there are blackspots and areas of disadvantage in the capital but they also exist in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Currently the east coast qualifies for Objective One status in transition but we in the west qualify for Objective One status and everything should be done by the Government to ensure that status is given to the west, some of the Northern counties and counties in the midlands on the grounds that they qualify for it.  The west represents a natural region.  It is not possible to take out streets or unemployment blackspots from a city and apply Objective One status to those areas. Every city throughout Europe has blackspots and we have to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive comments made by the Taoiseach in the House in answering questions on this issue.  I am aware he is examining it carefully and has demonstrated a clear understanding of the facts that will affect this decision.  I am hopeful that when the Government discusses the EU Structural Funds with the European Commission, it will put forward regionalisation as its stated position.  All we are asking for is equity and fair play.  The original idea behind Structural Funds was to have a convergence of incomes in this country.  Unfortunately, in the past six years the people in the west have fallen further behind and that is why the Bill is so urgently required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  I hope that in the months ahead we will see some improvement both economically and socially in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I welcome the Bill and we will support its passage through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish a Western Development Commission was taken by the last Government. The commission was established on a non-statutory basis by that Government pending the introduction of legislation.  We are pleased that legislation is now before the Dáil.  We should also acknowledge the role of the Council for the West established through the initiative of the western Catholic bishops which lobbied strongly for the establishment of a statutory development agency for the west.</P>
      <P>I represent an urban constituency in this House but as somebody who was born, brought up and educated in the west I am well aware and indeed have personal experience of the unique problems faced by the west arising from its relative isolation, inadequate infrastructure and poor access to many public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, however, to paint a picture of a region in terminal decline.  The west has much to be proud of &mdash; outstanding natural and scenic beauty, its heritage, clean environment and extensive coastline, its attractiveness as a place to live and its existing industrial base, all of which offer considerable potential for development.  Not <Col N="1450" /> all of the land in the west is of poor quality; there is much good agricultural land in the region.</P>
    <P>There is much success in the west and a great deal of physical evidence of achievement and wealth, but it is clearly not being shared out equally.  That is one of the issues the commission will have to examine.  Even the population drain has been halted.  Of the seven counties covered by the remit of the commission, six experienced population increases between 1991 and 1996 &mdash;&mdash; Clare increased by 3.4 per cent, Galway by 4.7 per cent and only Leitrim showed a loss of population in that period.  That does not make up for the substantial decline experienced in earlier decades, a loss which continues to have a negative impact on the region and which has distorted the demography of many areas of the west.</P>
    <P>Rural poverty tends to be less visible than its urban counterpart.  While poverty in the cities tends to be concentrated in highly visible urban blackspots, poverty in rural Ireland is often hidden away down boreens or on the sides of mountains, often represented by elderly people living on their own.  The poverty is exacerbated by isolation and remoteness from services.</P>
    <P>We should not make the mistake of equating rural poverty solely with farming.  Notwithstanding the very real difficulties currently facing agriculture, virtually all studies show that the percentage of farmers identified as being at risk from poverty has declined steadily.  For instance, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy produced by the last Government shows that when income is combined with the basic deprivation indicator, farmers make up only 3 per cent of those at risk from poverty in 1994 in comparison with 6 per cent in 1987.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is and will remain a key element in the economic life of the west, but farming on its own will not be able to give the region the lift it needs.  That requires a wide range of social, economic and infrastructural initiatives, and this is recognised in the wide range of functions for the commission set out in section 8.  Although I acknowledge the Minister of State's role in bringing the Bill to the House, is it appropriate that the sponsoring Government Department is the Department of Agriculture and Food?</P>
    <P>I am concerned by how duplication is to be avoided between the commission and other agencies with a similar remit.  For instance, Clare is within the commission's area of responsibility, yet SFADCo already has responsibility for industry, tourism and rural development in Clare.  The same case could be made for Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Gaeltacht areas.  How is duplication of work with national agencies which have similar objectives to the commission to be avoided?  These issues should be teased out.</P>
    <P>What financial resources are to be made available to the commission?  Section 21 states that the Minister for Agriculture and Food may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, advance to the commission, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. <Col N="1451" /> I know that approximately £25 million has already been promised to the Western Development Fund, but only £2.5 million has been allocated in the current year.  However, no indication is given in the Bill or its memorandum as to the likely level of ongoing finance that will be available to the commission.  It will clearly need substantial long-term funding if it is to make the desired impact in the west.</P>
    <P>The commission has worked away pending the introduction of this legislation and has produced an impressive programme of action.  I wish the commission well and hope this legislation marks the beginning of a new and exciting phase in the development of the west.  However, we must be cautious that while addressing the genuine disadvantage of one region we do not discriminate against other regions or communities with equal if not greater needs for attention.</P>
    <P>The reported intention of the Government to seek Objective One status only for the 13 midland and western counties in the next round of EU Structural Funds is most unfortunate.  This approach will discriminate against communities living in deprivation and poverty in cities like Dublin, Limerick and Cork as well as rural areas outside the stated Objective One counties.  The annual report of the Combat Poverty Agency, published last month, was the latest in a series of reports and studies which have identified disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods as a key source of poverty.  However, the Government is pursuing a strategy of seeking Objective One status for just 13 counties, placing other areas at a disadvantage when it comes to securing vital EU funding.  The Combat Poverty Agency noted that poverty and social exclusion are found throughout every county and that Structural Fund expenditure to tackle those problems is required in all regions.</P>
    <P>If we want to tackle poverty and disadvantage, it is essential that reductions in Structural Funds be kept to a minimum and that the process is managed effectively.  Seeking Objective One status for particular counties means all people in those counties stand to benefit regardless of their income.  I see no case for funding large conference centres, golf courses and other trappings of the corporate sector in those 13 counties designated for Objective One status while serious urban poverty and schemes to tackle that poverty are neglected in urban areas.  It makes far more sense to categorise the entire country in the same way, thus allowing the targeting of funds to tackle the problems of poverty and unemployment which are found in both urban and rural areas, rather than putting all the funding into particular geographical areas.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I do not object to the midland and western counties getting their fair share of EU Structural Funds.  I object to the fact that some of the poorest areas in the country are being deprived of an opportunity to get a crucial share of this EU funding because of their geographical location.  There is no guarantee that dividing the <Col N="1452" /> country in two will result in any more funding.  It will create a new border that will cut the country in half physically and cut the majority of poor people off from this vital funding.</P>
    <P>I also challenge the basis on which this case is being made.  A valuable study was recently published by two Trinity College economists, Dr. P. J. Drudy and Dr. Michael Punch entitled &ldquo;The Regional Problem: Regional Incomes and Urban Deprivation.&rdquo; Dr. Drudy in particular has been a very strong advocate of regional policy over the years.  He was arguing for regional development and emphasising the west of Ireland when it was much less popular than it is now.</P>
    <P>The study is highly significant.  It establishes that the basis for GDP and income on which this case has been made &mdash; Deputy Cooper-Flynn quoted these figures earlier &mdash; is totally distorted. For example, the calculation of GDP and income in Dublin includes every penny paid out in wages by organisations' headquarters in Dublin to people who are not necessarily living or working in Dublin.  I accept that every western Deputy arguing for Objective One status for his area is making a genuine argument, but his income shows up as income in Dublin because he is paid by the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance. It is the same for every engineer in the Office of Public Works paid from St. Stephen's Green and every teacher paid from Marlborough Street.  If workers are paid from Dublin, though they may be living and working in Clare or Sligo or elsewhere, their income shows up as Dublin income.  The calculation on which this case is based is a total distortion and needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Dr. Drudy notes in his study that when one looks more closely at income, Dublin falls behind the midlands and southeast in the lowest income group, which is income under £136 per week. Dublin also falls behind in the categories of £136 to £269 and £269 to £472 per week.  Dublin is ahead of other areas only in the category of more than £472 per week.  Again, that distorts the overall calculation of income in Dublin.  The study also shows that one cannot look solely at income. The cost of living must also be examined, and the study shows that the cost of living in Dublin is high, which results in a purchasing disadvantage. For example, the average Dublin household income is £51 per week higher than the midlands, but the cost of living in Dublin is £95 higher per week, which results in a purchasing disadvantage in Dublin of £44 per week.  When the figures are computed to decide which regions retain Objective One status, the cost of living and the much higher cost of housing in Dublin and the eastern area are not factored into the equation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which does not appear to have been taken into account is unemployment.  Dublin has performed significantly worse than other regions in the area of industrial employment, losing 26 per cent over the 1971-96 period.  It may be argued that much of this has been compensated for by an increase in service employment. <Col N="1453" /> However, much of it is low paid and part-time. Overall employment in the Dublin region has increased by 31 per cent over the past two decades, which is great news.  However, the labour force has increased by 43 per cent over the same period.  This means job provision in the Dublin area has fallen a long way behind the growth in the labour force.</P>
    <P>The problem is particularly acute in the area of long-term unemployment.  Much has been said about its concentration and the consequential concentration of social, economic and income problems in what are called &ldquo;blackspots&rdquo;.  No poverty in this country is as bad as that in the concentrations of urban poverty in the blackspots of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and other cities.  It would be astonishing if the Government were to produce a formula for Objective One status which identified for the European Union the areas in greatest need of attention from European funding and excluded the very areas which have the highest levels of unemployment, social problems and poverty.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of geographically dividing the country, although I understand the pressures on Members of the House to make a case for their county and region.  All of us are very good at stating the case for our own constituency. However, regarding Structural Funds, which will shape the way the country will develop over the next decade, there must be fairness, equity and consistency in their allocation.  No one can fail to appreciate that the economy is marvellous and is going well.  We all want that to continue. However, there is a huge problem with distribution and the gap between those benefiting from the economic success and those who are not is widening dramatically.  It is most obvious in the areas of urban poverty where there are high levels of unemployment and poverty and a very high degree of social alienation.  This manifests itself in many ways, in the drugs problem, in anti-social behaviour and in people dropping out from school.  There is a whole range of problems associated with concentrated poverty and unemployment. It is necessary, not just in the interest of the areas concerned but also in the interest of social cohesion throughout the country, that those areas are dealt with.  It would be wrong if the country were divided into areas with Objective One status and other areas on what is a spurious economic basis.  The figures do not stand up when closely examined.</P>
    <P>There is now a case, having regard to what is happening in terms of development and transport, to move away from splitting the country into regions for European funding.  The country has traditionally been regarded as one region for European funding.  There may well be an argument that it should not have been from the beginning, but it was and it does not make much sense to change that now.  Let us take the example of the commuter belt around Dublin.  An arc can be drawn from Dundalk through Athlone down to Wexford within which people live and commute <Col N="1454" /> to Dublin.  How can it be argued that they are in different regions?  Athlone is only 15 or 16 miles from Ballinasloe.  Deputy Connaughton would know better as he travels the road more often.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>This is not a country where areas and regions are so remote from each other that they justify this type of division, especially on a spurious economic basis.</P>
      <P>I understand this question is to be decided shortly by the Government.  It should not make the decision to favour one part of the country over another as that would be very divisive.  It is economically unsound at any rate and it is grossly unfair to the areas in greatest need as many will be excluded from Objective One status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the opportunity to comment on this issue.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore, when he spoke on Objective One status, had a different agenda to that which Deputy Connaughton or I would have, and a totally different one to that which he would have had he remained in County Mayo where he was born.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly very important this year.  We all welcome the Bill as it shows the Government's commitment to dealing with the situation which has developed in the west.</P>
      <P>This initiative resulted from the bishops' initiative of the early 1990s.  Everyone supported it because we had all seen the destruction which had taken place in terms of population loss, especially the loss of the highly educated.  Deputy Gilmore is an example.  He, like many others, found that he could make a better living for himself by moving to Dublin rather than, like the rest of us, remaining in the west.  I do not blame him for doing that because, if circumstances had been different, I might not have been here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will revise my opinion on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that the west and northwest have suffered severely since the foundation of the State.  Prior to that, there was a different regional breakdown.  The people from the northwest gravitated towards Belfast, which was the commercial centre for that part of the country. After the division of the country, the people of the region then gravitated towards Dublin. Down the years, the population of the west has declined at an enormous rate.  That loss of people has had a devastating effect on businesses, for example.  If there is not the population, businesses cannot be maintained.  There was also the loss of <Col N="1455" /> people involved in various activities, such as farmers and their families.  Most Civil Service jobs, until Fianna Fáil decided on decentralisation, were located in Dublin.  That was part of the policy of various Governments for 40 years.</P>
      <P>We are now trying to reverse that.  The £25 million being provided will enable the commission to aid projects which could not be aided under existing incentive schemes.  Small contributions can mean the difference between success and failure.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who has responsibility for western development. His efforts on this issue, Leader and other projects, and his willingness to visit these areas and meet local groups to see the problems, has been widely appreciated.  He has shown commitment to his brief.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore gave a dissertation on Objective One status.  Given that the Deputy comes from the west, I am surprised he did not even know how far it is to Athlone, despite the fact that it is on his route home.  This proves that those who leave the west return only occasionally.  It also means the west will have to create its own future; it will not be created from Dublin.</P>
      <P>Objective One status is a necessity for the development of rural areas.  Deputy Gilmore can cite figures such as the number of teachers paid by the Department of Education and Science in Marlborough Street.  However, teachers do not make up a large proportion of the population in the west.  It is disingenuous to use salaries paid by Departments in Dublin as a means of increasing the GDP in the west which has been proved to be below the national average.</P>
      <P>There are deprived areas in inner cities. However, it is not in our best interests to remove Objective One status from communities which are trying to help themselves and which are entitled to that status.  Politicians will continue to fight to maintain Objective One status for regions which are entitled to it.  The Government will deal with this issue in a favourable manner. Objective One status is our only chance of maintaining and attracting industry to the west.  The choice is simple if the west has the same grantaid status as Dublin.  There are additional costs involved in doing business in the west which do not arise in Dublin or the east.</P>
      <P>The road network in the west must also be improved.  This is progressing but not as fast as we would wish.  I welcome the important initiative taken by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in providing funding for improving the rail network in the west.  Deputy Gilmore spoke about commuters.  High speed rail links might enable us to widen the commuter belt to include parts of the west.  This issue will have to be examined.  Why are house prices roughly three to four times higher in Dublin than in the west, if the west is as prosperous as Deputy Gilmore suggests?  This proves that Dublin is seen as having a brighter future than the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that all counties are represented on the board of the commission.  This is imperative as counties will feel left out if they are not represented.  The board is big enough to facilitate such representation. Some of the underprivileged counties might be entitled to additional representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Two for County Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will settle for two for Leitrim without any problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is subdividing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>All counties must be represented on the board.  It is also important that those appointed are capable of doing the job.  There is an onus on every board to ensure funds are properly dispersed.  Executives may do a good job but board members make the decisions.  A decision should not be taken by an organisation which does not have the full support of the board.  I am a member of an enterprise board.  On occasions we have changed some of the decisions made by the evaluation committees.  This is not done in a negative sense.  However, we have discovered that local knowledge is an important advantage when making decisions.  People who know the individuals with whom they are dealing are in a better position to make decisions which are in the best interests of their organisations.  This is why it is imperative that all counties are represented on the board.</P>
      <P>Twenty five million pounds is a significant amount of money.  The commission will have £2 million to spend this year.  I am sure it will be difficult to find projects suitably advanced to disburse this money by the end of the year.  Next year the commission will have £5 million.  As time passes we hope to see benefits for the communities we represent.  We represent rural communities which do not have many large towns or cities. Rural areas have been the biggest losers.  With the support of the entire House, this Bill is an attempt to regenerate the west.  I wish Deputy Davern and all involved in the commission every success.  If successful, this project will be a mechanism to deal with some of the other underprivileged areas in towns and cities mentioned by Deputy Gilmore.  If there is to be subdivision, let it be positive subdivision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes this Bill.  Like many other Members, I have always advocated such a Bill and I thank the Minister of State for introducing it.  It was suggested that the Bill was slow to be introduced but I hope the Western Development Commission will do what it should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the western bishops' initiative and acknowledge the role played by the bishops and the five farmers who began this process.  Five or six years ago they went to see their bishops following <Col N="1457" /> a meeting on milk quotas in Loughrea which I attended.</P>
    <P>There have been many initiatives in the west, some of which worked.  Others duplicated the work of existing agencies.  This initiative has a better chance of success as it has a legislative basis and because of the continuity involved. Committees come and go but if there is not goodwill towards them they will not succeed.  Neither will the Western Development Commission succeed in the absence of goodwill.  The legislation being put through will provide the necessary continuity and back-up for this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission is an umbrella organisation for many developments in the west.  If people in towns and villages such as Ballina, Athenry, Tubbercurry and so on do not see this commission as a vehicle by which to use their experience and knowledge to better their own areas and if they are not encouraged to get involved, it will not work.  I accept that £25 million is a considerable sum but in the overall context it is not a huge sum, particularly when spread over five or six years.  We have to start at ground level and so far I am satisfied with what I have seen.  We all know what has happened in Kiltimagh but there are hundreds of similar areas.  Taking it at face value, it was a town without a future and where young people could not be educated quickly enough to get out.  That is replicated right across the west.  I have been in this business sufficiently long to recognise that some towns will progress while others will not and it is difficult to identify the reasons for that.</P>
    <P>I hope, through the various mechanisms employed by the Western Development Commission, those communities will understand that if they have a plan and decide to come together for the greater good of their community they will be helped, without resort to Dublin.  That is the important point.  Despite what Deputy Gilmore has said, the problem is that if one has to get a standard type biro one may have to go to Dublin for it.  Every report I have read in the past indicated that was the problem.  It is difficult to understand how Members can come into the House and welcome the legislation for the setting up of the Western Development Commission and at the same time say the area is not entitled to Objective One status.  I do not understand the logic involved.  One welcomes the Western Development Commission because it has the same effect as Objective One status.</P>
    <P>Part of this fund is earmarked for community development projects.  Given my limited contact with the Western Development Commission I am pleased with its level of expertise.  Regardless of how it spends its time from here on, it should never forget that it must instill into communities confidence to do things to which no State agency could aspire.</P>
    <P>I attended a community meeting in Athenry, County Galway recently and I hope the plans for Athenry, my local community, Mountbellew, and many other communities throughout the province <Col N="1458" /> will be carried out successfully.  The Minister will understand better than most that community development projects are usually funded on a 50:50 basis.  It is now apparent that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the community to raise its 50 per cent of the funding.  I suggest that in terms of cost there will have to be a greater appreciation of what local communities actually do.  I know it is being worked into the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have changed the system in the Leader programme to 7 per cent plus a recognition of the work of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am talking about and it will have to apply in this case also. Many people spend all their spare time doing community development work and it is right and proper that the State acknowledge their work.  If we get a lift because of the way in which the western development fund is used it should be acknowledged that what people do in their spare time on behalf of their community is saving the State money.  I do not wish to labour the point but I wished to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>There are two or three other matters which the Western Development Commission should consider, including duplication.  I am beginning to wonder whether it is possible not to have duplication. For example, under Leader, partnership boards, county enterprise boards, the Western Development Commission investment fund and many others, I hope there will be a mechanism to sift out whichever project is most suited for whatever funds are available.  Many people in community developments say the mind boggles at what is available but when they try to seek assistance they cannot get it.  With the concept of the one stop shops I hope assistance will be available.</P>
      <P>If the Western Development Commission is as successful as it should be it will answer one of the questions we may have for Europe on Objective One status.  The day may well come when a body such as the Western Development Commission is set up in the three regions that make up the 13 counties.  If the EU view is that devolved government is meaningful, transparent and works at community level, this Bill may be amended to include the entire area.  I see no reason that should not happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Development Commission, in conjunction with all the other agencies, must ensure the population haemorrhage of the west, which is slowly beginning to stabilise in most areas, will remain stable.  It is obvious with the current trend, not only in Ireland but across the world, that there will be fewer farmers in Ireland in five years' time.  Given the low concentration in the west we cannot afford to lose farmers but the policy should be at least to get people to live in local communities.  There may be fewer farmers but at least the population would begin to increase.  That is why the physical planning which should exist and which is being undertaken in various councils, regional organisations, etc. in the <Col N="1459" /> five Connacht counties must be geared towards ensuring that however we manage it the population begins to increase.  This issue has been raised <i>ad nauseam</i> over the years.  If the population falls below a certain level the community becomes unsustainable and it is not possible to provide the necessary services, resulting in the hairdresser, bank, doctor and vet disappearing from an area.  A parish where this happens will then fall on its knees and die.</P>
    <P>Against this background I sincerely hope the legislation will help stabilise the communities to which I am referring.  I also hope the communities which are listening to and reading about this debate will be encouraged to work in a co-operative manner and that the Government and Oireachtas will send a signal that they acknowledge what people are doing on behalf of their local communities.  Many people, who are working out of the goodness of their hearts, genuinely believe nobody cares a damn what they do.  In this context the signal we are sending today is vitally important.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining I wish to comment on Objective One status.  People welcome the Western Development Commission for several reasons, including the environment it will create in the west, which will allow people get jobs.  Every year 6,600 graduates come from the west but unfortunately they move from the area in which they were born, reared and educated. Many of them have skills which are very important to the region, but they cannot be blamed for leaving if job opportunities do not exist.  The commission, if backed up by Objective One status, will be able to say to industrialists that there is a very cohesive policy in the area and that the infrastructure will be introduced which will make it attractive for people to locate businesses there.</P>
    <P>I smiled when Deputy Gilmore spoke about the problems in Dublin.  Of course there are huge problems in Dublin, but the message lost on everybody is that there are quite definitive rules laid down by the EU in the context of eligibility for Objective One status.  The rules are written in tablets of stone and will not be changed.  Under GDP guidelines Ireland as a whole is not eligible, something we are aware of and accept.  However, there are three regions in the country which meet the necessary criteria, namely, the west, the midlands and the Border counties.  The EU, the Government and the people know that no matter what is done these are the only areas according to the statistics which can gain Objective One status. Those concerned with Dublin are saying that by this area getting Objective One status, Dublin will get less.  This is not correct.  Those in Dublin will get Objective One status in transition.  In terms of investment there is a fairly big gap between Objective One status and Objective One status in transition and it is very hard to understand the logic of arguing that the whole country should accept Objective One status in transition and that <Col N="1460" /> by doing otherwise we are dividing the country. We are not dividing the country, no more than we are dividing the country by passing this Bill which is geared towards doing a job in a particular area.</P>
    <P>If it transpires that the rest of the country receives Objective One status in transition, it is still incumbent on the Government to ensure the black spots in those regions are looked after.  I could discuss this issue all day.  It is fair to point out to those who believe they are going to lose something by being excluded from Objective One status that they were not going to receive such status in any event and that Objective One status is a plus for the poorer areas.  The Government must give a commitment to the black spots which undoubtedly exist outside areas with Objective One status.  People talk about black spots, but in the area I am talking about there are people who live on bad roads and in towns with no sewerage. In addition there are countless thousands of houses with no running water and nobody can tell me the infrastructure is up to standard.  If we do not get Objective One status for another five or seven years we will never catch up with the rest of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Western Development Commission Bill.  Like other speakers, I remember the small farmers in south Galway who went to their bishops about the serious problems they were experiencing, particularly concerning the milk quota, and the response of the bishops and community leaders in western counties was to see what could be done by working in partnership &mdash;&mdash; an important word at the time &mdash; to develop the western counties, including Donegal and Clare. This led to the establishment of the Western Partnership Board, with offices being opened in Sligo leading to an action plan resulting from the document, &ldquo;Crusade for Survival&rdquo;.  We are delighted the action plan has led to the legislation introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern.</P>
      <P>It is also fitting that we remember the various Governments which were involved in bringing the Bill to this stage, namely, those led by Deputies Albert Reynolds and John Bruton.  In particular, I compliment Deputy Davern who not only introduced the legislation but who has been so effective in meeting the various groups throughout my constituency and other areas in Connaught, Donegal and Clare, and helping them with projects including the Leader programme. His visits have ensured more interest is developing the Leader programme and I think there has been an increase in applications for Leader funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers and bishops spoke in particular about development in areas such as agriculture, natural resources, marine, tourism and arts and heritage projects.  I hope the commission will work in particular on these issues which were the <Col N="1461" /> objectives of the group which met the bishops in Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the very laudable objective of achieving population stability before the end of the decade at 1991 census levels on a county basis.  Some parts of the west are doing quite well.  Fr. Micheál Mac Gréil spoke recently about the growth of Galway city and said it is causing the same problems for the west as the growth of Dublin is causing for the rest of the country.  There is a general consensus that regional development is not balanced.  The survey carried out by Fr. Mac Gréil on the Archdiocese of Tuam reveals population growth in places such as Galway, Castlebar and Westport.  However, serious problems are being experienced in rural areas.  The late Canon Horan coined the phrase &lsquo;the black triangle&rsquo; in regard to the area around Horan International Airport.  Fr. Mac Gréil went further in referring to the development of a black rectangle with an increasingly large area of Mayo and Galway suffering from depopulation and emigration.  I hope this legislation will result in assistance being obtained for such communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to liaison with regional authorities, State agencies and non-State agencies as that may result in the development of certain projects on the passing of this legislation.  The Minister stated the Western Development Commission would be in a position to consult with any Minister, not merely a particular one.  It is important that fast, effective action is taken in regard to the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to take much of the red tape from the workings of the commission, evidenced by the fact that only projects in excess of £250,000 must be referred to the Minister for approval.  The commission will not be involved in any major infrastructural projects such as the development of national roads; that will remain a matter for the NRA and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extra funding allocated by successive Governments to the rail network from Dublin to the west.  However, there are railways within the region, particularly the line from Sligo to Limerick, which could form part of a Euro-rail network if the system could be linked to Rosslare. Fr. Mac Gréil also refers to the Sligo-Limerick rail line in his study and makes the point that areas ten miles either side of it have been very badly affected by unemployment, depopulation and emigration.  The survey carried out on the Archdiocese of Tuam reveals that the areas worst affected are inland parishes on the eastern half of the diocese and on the far west coast.  While the latter may do quite well during the tourist season, they experience very serious problems for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been levelled at the amount of funding being provided to the commission.  If that were the only funding being invested in the west, I would agree it would not be sufficient. However, I referred earlier to the changes in the <Col N="1462" /> Leader programme which will be of great assistance in the development of the west.  The 50 per cent local contribution has been reduced and the Minister has announced that, where community enterprise is involved, the grant will increase to 70 per cent.  Own labour is now recognised as constituting private matching funds.  Community groups may gain approval for funding of up to £200,000 in certain circumstances.  These changes are to be welcomed and I hope we can build on them.  Perhaps some changes could also be made in regard to county enterprise boards which are very beneficial.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism that this legislation seeks to assist a particular region.  I cannot understand that as it should always be a Government's duty to help disadvantaged areas.  Other parts of the country have also been assisted, SFADCo has helped the mid west, Údarás na Gaeltachta is responsible for assisting Gaeltacht areas and support is provided to Border counties through the Ireland Fund and EU funding.  I do not see why anyone would object to such assistance in the Border region which has suffered from lack of investment because of the conflict which existed in the North for so many years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the allocation of Structural Funds, one could say the west has done quite well on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  Funding has been received for headage and premia schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy but in regard to capital funding for roads development and so on the west is approximately 20 per cent behind the national average.  Every small town and village in County Galway is crying our for improved sewerage and water schemes.  It is logical that assistance would be provided to the west through the commission or other means.</P>
    <P>The issue of Objective One status has been a source of much debate in recent months.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has urged the granting of Objective One status to the western, Border and midland counties.  One could make the case that if Objective One status were granted to those regions and the rest of the country were granted Objective One status during the transitional period, everyone would benefit.  If the whole country is granted Objective One status in transition, it will get nothing post 2006.  It would be better to have Objective One status for the Border, midland and western regions and Objective One status in transition for the rest of the country.  After the year 2006, some parts of the country will, I hope, continue to receive funding.</P>
    <P>I understand there are two types of funding, two thirds for Objective One status and one third for Objective One status in transition, and that we are not drawing out of the one pool.  We would be able to get more funding if we had Objective One status for areas that are under 75 per cent of GDP.  Those areas were clearly defined in all the studies on how the different regions were doing.  The sad fact is that the areas we are talking about, the western, Border and midland regions, comprise about half the land <Col N="1463" /> mass of the Republic but only a quarter of the population.  If the population decreases further we will be in very serious trouble in the future. Some people are leaving farming and many people are moving to the bigger cities.</P>
    <P>There is no simple solution to this problem.  We cannot look at black spots throughout the country. We have to look at regions as other countries have done.  There are good examples of this in France and in Devon and Cornwall in Great Britain.  Other countries in the European Union have drawn up regional plans which bring certain regions under the 75 per cent GDP and allow them to qualify for funding.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be a further urban rural divide in relation to this.  Deputy Gilmore, who is not only from Galway but from my own parish, said that this was an unfair proposition.  As somebody who received some of my education in Dublin and taught there for four years, I have always supported developments for Dublin, including the docklands development and the Financial Services Centre which have been a great bonus for Dublin and could be copied in other cities. Huge amounts of money have been spent in Dublin on roads and bridges, ring roads are proposed and it is proposed to put a lot of money into a light rail system.  This has been supported by people throughout the country.  I would not like to see people on the east coast objecting to further badly needed investment in the western region.</P>
    <P>We must look for positive decisions in the future, particularly by the IDA, to locate industries in smaller provincial towns.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has suggested that the IDA should put a regional policy in place.  If there is no employment in those towns the people will not stay.  People want to live as near to their employment as possible, and if the industrial infrastructure were provided in those areas, many houses could be built.  That is one of the most compelling reasons for getting Objective One status.  If that could be achieved for the western, Border and midland regions, industrial development would follow and we could discriminate in favour of the western regions in the context of employment.  I do not know why grants should be given to companies that locate in the bigger cities.  It goes against all logic, given the problems with traffic, pollution and the environment that cities should be allowed to get bigger and bigger.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals in the survey carried out by Fr. McGreil was that a department of regional development be established in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Castlebar.  This is a new institute linking up with Galway.  The proposal is that that institute should deal with matters relating to socio-economic revival in the west. He also proposes that the curriculum of all second level schools in the west should include a module on local and regional development to create in the young an awareness of the needs and problems of their communities.  Young <Col N="1464" /> people would then be interested in their own region and in the development that should take place.  There is an imbalance in development currently. We have to get that balance right in discussing this Bill; if not, we will face more problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The people on the commission are very competent. Further appointments will have to be made, and I hope every county will be represented. I would make the case also for having another local authority member &mdash; there is only one at the moment.  The farmers in Galway who began this campaign should be recognised in some way.  Perhaps the Minister can do that, although he would need the wisdom of Solomon to include everyone on the commission who should be on it.  I hope there will be regional representation and that the commission will be successful in its work.  I commend the region and the commission on their work and look forward to their playing a very active role in the regional social development of the western counties of Connacht and Counties Donegal and Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds.</P>
      <P>This is most welcome legislation which enables the Western Development Commission to make two important interventions in the fostering of economic and social development in the seven western counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Clare.  These interventions are, first, at policy level and, second, in the form of financial assistance.  I compliment the chief executive Mr. Liam Scollan and Mr. Seán Tighe on their outstanding dedication over a period of time and on the work they have put into this.</P>
      <P>This Bill will enable the commission to work with Government Departments and their agencies as well as with regional and local bodies in achieving a co-ordinated approach to the development of the west.  This means that the commission will have a central role in ensuring that policies on a wide range of issues, such as infrastructure and communications, business development and training, will be formulated effectively as one cohesive development strategy for the west.  This is long overdue.  Where policies are not working and could be improved or withdrawn, the commission will have the remit to co-operate with relevant Departments or bodies in achieving a better match for the area.  This is also very important.  It is a particularly important role, given the need for Objective One status for the western and Border regions.</P>
      <P>The Western Commission has already worked in partnership with regional and national bodies on the development of a prioritised and costed programme that embraces all strands of economic development in the region.  This work will form the basis on which full Objective One status for the western and Border regions can be drawn down and applied with maximum impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another key issue addressed by the legislation <Col N="1465" /> is that under the terms of the Bill the commission will promote and manage the £25 million Exchequer western investment fund.  This fund will be instrumental in accelerating development in the region by providing medium and long-term investment and should be very effective.  The fund will enable the commission to draw up initiatives in partnership with the public and private sectors. It is important to include the private sector.  One area where it will be very effective is the upper Shannon scheme.  When the commercial aspect gets the go-ahead it will be a massive asset to the Western Development Commission because it will encourage private enterprise to spend its own money and get the tax benefits that will underpin this.  That will be the making of it.</P>
    <P>It is important, once the commission is established, that it has the full co-operation of national, regional and local bodies and strong cross-party political support.  Progress is often about change and there must be a healthy openness to changing policies which work nationally but are not working regionally.  GDP levels in the west must converge and exceed EU levels.  The commission has a vital role, as I explained earlier, in helping to maximise EU funds.</P>
    <P>The west needs to attract more employers who will create much needed jobs.  The commission has already mapped out why the west is an attractive place for employers by cataloguing its assets.  It has 2,000 acres of development land available for manufacturing and service investment. Almost 7,000 third level students will graduate in 1999 and over 40,000 people are available for work.  The west has the potential to attract growth and employment in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, software, engineering, multimedia and food processing.</P>
    <P>There is a huge amount of work which can be done.  The west has much to offer potential investors, with up to 2,000 acres of development land. There is a huge emphasis on local economic development, which is very good to see.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the presence of many large and successful companies in the west.  They offer highly paid employment which greatly increases the tax revenue of the State and are the source of considerable export earnings in worldwide markets.  Many of them also carry out important research work which helps develop the region.</P>
    <P>If we have any complaint in the north-west and Border regions about these multinational companies, whether they are of native or overseas origin, it is that we do not have enough of them.  The success of firms such as Abbott Laboratories in Sligo and Fruit of the Loom in Donegal &mdash; which is currently going through difficulties which are a sign of what can happen to big companies &mdash; is telling proof that we do not have enough multinationals.</P>
    <P>However, there is evidence available to most ordinary men and women, borne out by the experience of dedicated people working in development agencies, that small businesses are <Col N="1466" /> more likely to struggle to survive and are likely to remain small in scale.  Most people are aware of the definition of a &ldquo;small firm&rdquo; but the definition is different in Europe.  In Ireland we have traditionally thought of any firm with more than ten employees as entering the realm of a medium-sized enterprise but the official EU definition of an SME is a firm with less than 500 employees.</P>
    <P>We have also had some difficulty with the definition of &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;, which was usually taken as referring to industry, and in the very narrow sense to manufacturing industry.  It is important when considering the whole question of an enterprise society and what needs to be done to encourage and support the growth of small enterprises to emphasise we are not just talking about manufacturing.  This was a common misconception in the past.  Towns and villages tended to regard the attraction of a factory to their area as the only solution to their unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>The State agencies, partnerships and enterprise companies are now all working in partnership. Not only in Ireland but worldwide, there is a clear recognition of the importance of small and medium-sized firms.  I am a huge supporter of small companies.  Such companies provide a very high proportion of all jobs, even in the most advanced and well developed economies, and are recognised as crucial to the health of the economy. This is especially true for remote and under populated areas which, by their nature, have a small home market base and have suffered greatly.</P>
    <P>The west has suffered from problems of access, the difficulty and expense of getting products to the wider market and a poor infrastructure, which makes it important to have Objective One status for the region.  From listening to Deputy Gilmore, it is obvious he is not fully aware of the huge lack of infrastructure in the west.  This lack of infrastructure was a real impediment to attracting large industry and also had a bad effect on the morale of the region and economic development generally.</P>
    <P>It is greatly to the credit of successive Governments and the support of the EU Structural Funds that there is clear evidence these problems of access and infrastructure are being overcome. If we get Objective One status for the region, this problem will have been overcome in the west by 2006.</P>
    <P>The national road network needs to be improved.  Major water and sewerage systems need to be upgraded.  The regional airports, such as the one in Sligo, have huge potential but need much more assistance.  The EU could do a great deal in that regard.  There have been huge improvements in telecommunications technology and we have all seen the advances in Dell computers. There have been physical improvements of towns and villages, which have been greatly enhanced by EU funding.</P>
    <P>These improvements in access and infrastructure are important, and not only for the future <Col N="1467" /> attraction of large-scale enterprise.  They support the case for decentralisation and facilitate the provision of valuable employment opportunities in major educational and health establishments, all of which enhance the commercial and social life of the regions.  They are crucial to the encouragement and development of small-scale enterprise.</P>
    <P>The success of this scheme and the development of the west and the Border regions depends on the promotion of enterprise.  The circumstances of the modern world are changing dramatically with the changes in technology.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that many of the future growth sectors, such as tourism, information technology and international trade and services, can thrive at the level of small and medium-sized enterprises.  They are not disadvantaged by being served from the centre, provided they have the appropriate modern communication facilities. The western commission will do a great deal to promote that.  The Minister has been in Sligo on many occasions and has met Leader boards, of which he is very supportive and for which I am very thankful.</P>
    <P>A healthy and balanced economy needs a good mix of the successful large firms which we are delighted to have in the Sligo-Leitrim region &mdash;&mdash; such as Abbott Laboratories, Bruss and Saehan Media &mdash; and thriving small firms.  It is important to have thriving small enterprises in small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty has been a major promoter of the upper Shannon scheme and I thank him for his efforts in that regard.  I appeal to him to promote the commercial end of that scheme. There are many companies waiting for the end of the tax year to invest money and it would be fantastic if that investment could start as soon as possible.  That would underpin this Bill because it would encourage private business to get involved.</P>
    <P>The Government and the State agencies now have the challenge to continue to create the overall climate in which small enterprise can thrive. This Bill will contribute towards achieving that objective and provide imaginative and innovative support systems with a minimum of regulations. It is important to reduce regulations and administrative impediments so that the small companies which are beginning to emerge can take initiatives and grow.</P>

      <P>We divide the constituency equally, which is the main thing.  I will be happy enough when Deputy Perry heads the poll in the next election and I am elected last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been awaited for quite some time. My only criticism of the Government is the time lapse in bringing the Bill to the House but, having said that, I welcome it.  I know the Minister of <Col N="1468" /> State, Deputy Davern, is very committed to implementing this legislation, which will be of tremendous benefit to the development of the west.</P>
    <P>I compliment Liam Scollan, the chief executive of the Western Development Commission, Seán Tighe, the chairman, and its staff on the work they have done over the past two years in helping to bring this legislation to the House.  I also welcome the £25 million which has been made available and the whole idea of partnership.</P>
    <P>However, I hope the Western Development Commission will not be just another layer of bureaucracy.  We already have Leader groups, partnership boards, local authorities, the International Fund for Ireland in the Border regions, county enterprise boards and now we have the Western Development Commission.  The administration costs to the State of running all those groups is huge.  How much of the money given to these authorities is spent on administration and how much at the coalface?  For a small country we have a great deal of administration.  I hope the Western Development Commission can bring these groups together rather than being another independent group.  The partnership aspect of the Bill is extremely important but the Minister has gone far enough in knitting the groups together. I will return to this on Committee Stage because there is a good and pragmatic case for bringing these bodies closer.  For the social and economic development of the area, it is imperative that most of this money is spent at the coalface rather than on administration.</P>
    <P>We need radical thinking in developing the west.  The biggest difficulty for most of the counties involved, particularly my county, is the lack of people.  Leitrim, north and rural Roscommon, and much of south and west Sligo has a small population base and people are leaving the area. The Minister said it was time I got married but my problem is that I cannot find a woman in any of those places &mdash; if I could I would have married long ago.  Perhaps when I reach 40 he will be best man at my wedding.</P>

      <P>In 1973 there were 37 boys in sixth class, my class, in Ballinamore school, and only four of us live there now.  Thirty of those 37 went to third level education.  That is a huge number to leave the area but unfortunately nothing is happening to bring those people back.  The Western Development Commission must play an aggressive role in bringing the bodies together and providing an incentive for industrial and commercial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the rural renewal scheme, commend the Government for establishing it and like Deputy Perry I hope it will be up and running in the short term.  Many Fianna Fáil backbenchers, including Deputy Doherty, played an important role in bringing this into being and it will be of tremendous benefit to the area.  However, we <Col N="1469" /> have to be even more radical.  The Department of Finance is used to urban renewal, which has been successful, but rural renewal is a different concept with different problems and simply changing the goalposts will not solve them.  There must be lateral thinking and discussion.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Finance Bill I proposed the idea of a new town in the north Roscommon/south Leitrim area.  We need people, whereas the cities are choking, house prices are crazy and traffic is gridlocked.  In England, Milton Keynes was built and a new infrastructure was put in place, including universities, colleges and other social development, and people were moved there.  We must be as radical as that.  Some people think I am talking pie in the sky but eventually there will be movement.  The development of the rail line in Sligo and Leitrim and the improvements to the N4 will be of help but we need people.  The radical idea of a new town in that area should not be dismissed but thought about and investigated, and it will be possible in a number of years.</P>
    <P>Objective One status is something of a warhorse and everyone who has spoken so far is in favour of retaining it for the west, the midlands and the Border counties.  We are within the European economic criteria for Objective One status and if we do not maintain that status the pace of industrial and infrastructural development in the west will be slow.  We need the infrastructure to bring industry to the area.  I was amazed to read that the IDA has not brought one industry into County Leitrim in the past 20 years, although Forbairt did introduce some firms.  This shows the size of our problem, and Leitrim is a microcosm of the problems of the west.</P>
    <P>We are going through a crisis in agriculture and the sector faces huge changes in the next ten years.  If the Western Development Commission does not play a role in providing alternative means of making a living in rural Ireland there will be huge difficulties.  This comes back to the basic fact that what is needed in the west is people.  The Minister has traversed most of the region since his appointment and is aware of the difficulties.  It is imperative that he leads from the front and maintains his enthusiasm for and commitment to development.  I am not sure about Deputy Kenny's suggestion of increasing the size of the Western Development Commission. Smaller committees work better, if they grow they become talking shops.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government for introducing the Bill and wish it the best of luck.  I hope it has the effect we all desire, of bringing development to the area.  I pay tribute to the large number of voluntary organisations who have worked hard to foster this concept, including the bishops in the region.  This is the start but much radical thinking is needed.  I look forward to participating on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the kind remarks made by my colleagues, Deputy Perry and Deputy Gerry Reynolds, on the opposite side. Not only were they kind remarks but they reflected the co-operation and co-ordinated efforts among Oireachtas Members in the west and in the differing constituencies.  I also take the opportunity to pay special thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for bringing forward this legislation and for the efforts he made since the commission was announced.  In the intervening period, he visited every county in the area, consulted widely and encouraged, in a hands on way, the type of development envisaged under the commission.</P>
      <P>The commission is important for a variety of reasons and its functions and role are diverse. One of the important elements is that it will become a co-ordinating forum for other agencies. As was mentioned by a previous speaker, there is a multiplicity of agencies in the west.  Some were mentioned, including the county councils, Leader, partnership boards, enterprise boards, the peace and reconciliation fund, regional tourism organisations, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Forbairt, the regional fisheries board and the International Fund for Ireland, which is not a statutory body but has a cross-Border function.  We now have the Western Development Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> These agencies are doing a worthy job which I witnessed in my constituency recently during a visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.  We looked at some novel projects which had been developed.  The consequence of the development meant jobs were created, a service was provided and the developments were viable.  They were of a high standard and high skills were deployed.  I refer in particular to Tulsk and what the community did there, to Boyle and the use of the Internet from the King House in relation to tourism and to the Arigna area where wonderful projects have been engaged in which have created jobs and improved the economy in those areas.</P>
    <P>It would be unwise not to recognise that this legislation should not be seen as a conflict between the west and any other part of the country, particularly given the difficulties in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The problem in the west is that over many years its population has moved to the east coast, although many thousands went elsewhere.  The over-population of this beautiful city, the decline in the quality of its services, the critical situation which exists in relation to traffic and housing and the many social problems which exist have been contributed to largely by the population decline in the west.</P>
    <P>What is happening in the west may appear at first glance to be a solution to western problems, but I would like to look at the broader picture and see it as a contributing factor in finding a solution to the national crisis where there is such a disparity between places in the west and Dublin, although they face the same problems in many instances.</P>
    <P>The departure of our population has left expensive services unused in many areas.  On the other hand, there is also a lack of services.  Real investment in the area cannot occur unless we are able to service and supply persons who want to invest in business projects or to live there and work in a professional capacity.  This type of development is primarily intended to encourage people to come back to the area, create job opportunities for themselves and others and to use available facilities.  I hope their return will encourage development and investment by the Department and the Government in other areas.</P>
    <P>Rural development and urban renewal has been proposed for many areas of the country.  The rural development pilot scheme covers Counties Longford, Roscommon, south Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan.  While I welcome what has been done by the Minister for Finance and his acknowledgement of what needs to be done, designation does not mean anything unless we have the type of investment which ensures basic services such as water and sewerage schemes.  Many of the towns in the areas I mentioned do not have water and sewerage schemes.  That is hard to say as someone who comes from the west.  It is with regret that I say there many places in my county which do not have a quality water supply or a sewerage system.  We cannot attract or encourage investment to the villages or <Col N="1472" /> townships where such services are inadequate or non-existent.  At the end of the day, the opportunity to achieve something through designation will be lost.  That is an essential element of this debate and I take this opportunity to make the position clear.</P>
    <P>We must also take account of the planning laws in the area covered by the Western Development Commission.  Planning is slow and in my county some genuine planning officers are working extremely hard and are engaged in a exercise which, to a large degree, lacks uniformity with neighbouring counties.  The personal view of county manager as the planning officer is often superimposed.  This results in difficulties for certain types of development.  Naturally, development must take account of the highest environmental standards.  The time in which a person may hope to receive planning permission should be reduced and, therefore, staffing and the necessary supports should be made available.  Above all, it should be recognised that it is not undesirable to build beside a river or a lake or to build in proximity to any amenity provided it is protected, safeguards are put in place and the development is compatible with what should be the case in a rural or urban setting.</P>
    <P>In many instances, the opinions of county managers are superimposed on local communities and development is seriously constricted.  The ability of individuals to engage in projects or in residential housing is seriously restricted because of the River Shannon, boglands and mountains.  Many counties have such features, not to mention others, which may impose restrictions.  Some are very legitimate, such as national monuments and places of heritage.  The establishment of conservation areas, the protection of wildlife and areas of interest for ornithology impose restrictions. Consequently, we must review the situation.</P>
    <P>The executive function in the hands of managers should be broadened as no individual should have total responsibility for designing planning policy, although it is contained in the statutory provisions which apply.  There should be a board representation of farming, business, commercial, technical and heritage interests comprising five or six people, each of whom is in a position to evaluate applications expeditiously, while acknowledging the social, economic, environmental and other needs of the area.  Such uniformity does not currently exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny and I are aware that in the case of some applications made in respect of areas along the Mayo and Roscommon border, one is seriously restricted in Roscommon while one will find a common sense approach to a similar application in County Mayo.  That is not good enough at a time when investment and development is so necessary and, more importantly, the public perception of how the law is applied should be seen to be fair and equal for everybody.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to acknowledge that there is a decline in agriculture.  This is my 25th year in politics and each time I canvass I find more unoccupied houses.  These houses are surrounded <Col N="1473" /> by afforestation.  Some have collapsed while people from elsewhere in the EU reside in others. In general afforestation has not had a positive impact on the local community.  People will say that Masonite would not be in Carrick-on-Shannon were it not for the afforestation of the area. Masonite did not set up there because of a few thousand acres of young forestry in Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo, Mayo.</P>
    <P>However, the effects of afforestation, as described by the EPA, can seriously damage the environment, waterways and fish life.  It has not made a contribution to employment, but it has caused our roads to be ripped up, imposed great inconveniences on many local communities and destroyed the landscape.  One cannot build a house in particular locations but one can plant hectares of forestry, which in many instances produces poor grade timber, with all the consequences I outlined.  There is a presumption that trees grow better on bad land.  That is not the case because trees need good land which does not produce the chemical reactions that result in the type of pollution about which I spoke earlier. One can compare this to the often irrational attitudes of planners about the building of a house or a number of houses in what they describe as high amenity locations.  The presumed damage done by a number of houses is nil because of the many systems available to treat sewage; it is a well refined concept.</P>
    <P>However, afforestation attracts large grants. One can almost carry out a 100 per cent plantation courtesy of one grant.  There are also great tax opportunities, but the people engaged in the industry do not live in the areas where the plantations take place.  Many of them are involved in major corporate interests that plant for tax purposes. I do not mind people doing well or corporate interests making profits as it is necessary to generate and create wealth to benefit the less well off, but I am concerned when that which is vital to local communities is damaged or destroyed, they are not consulted and doubtful regulations are involved.  It is important that this is recognised in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dublin is critical in terms of transport, crime, drugs and other social problems. I do not like anybody criticising our capital city but we must be in a position to avail of good transport services and technology and develop areas outside Dublin.  The many thousands of firms based in Dublin do not have to employ non-core staff engaged in accountancy, administration and personnel in the city.  They could be moved to Castlebar, Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon, Roscommon, Sligo or other towns because the technology is available to allow for such transfers. They could buy cheaper houses and get away from the gridlock in Dublin, thereby avoiding confrontation and road rage.  Most people would need a psychiatric consultant's examination on arrival at their place of work in the morning.</P>

      <P>I often wonder whether the Order of Business is affected by the condition of Members arriving in the House having been caught up in gridlock.  People who live outside Dublin enjoy a better quality of life.  If people moved to an area of the country that we are trying to develop they would contribute such development by using the schools, shops, garages, public houses and other services that are currently under threat.  Major co-ordination of planning is necessary and I hope the Western Development Commission will have an opportunity to achieve that.</P>
      <P>Objective One status will contribute to the national interest if it is provided for in the context of the 13 counties which need it most.  Some people seem to forget that three new states &mdash;&mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria &mdash; are joining the EU.  As they are net contributors there is no reason to believe this will further reduce what Ireland is likely to receive.  If the west or rural areas generally are included, we will make a contribution towards the problems in urban areas.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Doherty.  He feels strongly about this issue and has raised it many times at our parliamentary party meetings.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill because it is very important for Ireland as a whole.  It has been rightly pointed out that in the long-term when this Bill bears fruit it will be good for Dublin.  Dublin is groaning under the pressure created by traffic, house prices, crime, drugs and urban sprawl.  People want houses and should be able to buy them. There are many great aspects to Dublin but much of this pressure has resulted from people moving to the east coast.  They are not staying on the west coast, even though many of them want to, because for a variety of reasons it has not been developed as it should.  Many of these people come to Dublin and live in my constituency.  As they cannot buy a place to live they rent flats at an outrageous cost.  Outrageous landlords in this city are ripping off tenants, many of whom have had to come to Dublin for work, by increasing rents by 30 per cent a year.  They have not made any improvements to flats and there is no valid reason for such an increase.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill not only for the long-term future of the west but for Ireland and especially Dublin.  Well structured development in the west would lift the pressure off Dublin, which would reduce the severity of many of the problems we face.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for introducing this important legislation.  I have no doubt that in the long-term it will work and the west will awake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is different from the type we normally have in the House.  Members <Col N="1475" /> on all sides have given their own opinions, which in most cases make a great deal of common sense. Deputies Doherty and Eoin Ryan should be complimented on what they said.  Deputy Ryan is the first Dublin based Deputy I heard say that the west deserves development.  He did not take the line most Dublin Deputies would take, that the west should not qualify for Objective One status because that would take money from Dublin.  He has taken a more commonsense pragmatic line, that if the west was developed, it would ease the pressure on this gridlocked city and improve matters for the two areas.  I would prefer if the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, was a member of Cabinet dealing with the matter.  He was a member of Cabinet in a previous Administration and has considerable experience.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Carey had responsibility for this area in the previous Government, his Department was assigned under the Department of the Taoiseach which has a strong co-ordinating role and the ability, where necessary, to shift bureaucracy within Departments.  The Government decided for whatever reason that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, should have responsibility for this area.  That places agriculture at a primacy level and reduces the impact on this area from other Departments leaving the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, with a truncated version of what was originally the intention in regard to the Western Development Commission.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this Bill.  One is the fostering of economic and social development and the other is in regard to financial assistance. Many Deputies outlined the range of bodies and organisations in the seven counties that would be affected by such a commission.  I do not know the impact such a commission's ability to co-ordinate and plan activities would have on the actions taken by those various organisations and bodies. I have received faxed requests and questionnaires about the future of enterprise boards, leadership schemes and ADM bodies and some people have fixed views in that regard.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in the Shelbourne Hotel farmers put forward their case to resolve the severe agricultural crisis and the Minister was attacked when he made his contribution on behalf of the Government.  Later that afternoon we met representatives of the 13 counties in the three European regions which seek to qualify for Objective One status, the Border counties, the midlands and the west.  They put forward their cases in a clear and vociferous manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Securing Objective One status is part of the Government's programme.  The three regions &mdash;&mdash; as distinct from counties &mdash; identified meet the European criteria for that status.  The information from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies's office is that if administrative and regional structures were put in place which are acceptable to the Commission, <Col N="1476" /> that could facilitate their qualification.  By doing that, we could prove the Government's point.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission enshrines western development as a prime objective of all Government bodies and agencies.  If that is the case and if securing Objective One status for those areas is part of the Government programme, that would allow £16 billion a year in Structural Funds for Objective One areas.  It would allow those three regions, and the seven counties concerned in this case, access to that fund for whatever infrastructural or major projects were in line.  That would help the Government achieve its prime objective, the development in the west, and it would prove its point.</P>
    <P>ICTU representatives have gone to Brussels today to meet Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and they will put pressure on Ministers to make a decision on this.  It is crucial for the three regions involved that they be allowed access to the bigger fund in respect of Structural Funds.  If they do not have access to that, they will not be able to develop in the way the Minister of State wants them to develop.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made a good speech at the Ballina Humbert School when he set out his vision for our future.  A major question for the Government is the type of future Ireland wants. That is why the farmers are here.  Will the family farm and holding be an integral part of Ireland in the next century?  Will the land be allowed to lie fallow in all cases?  We do not know what will be the consequences of the next year's ministerial conference in Geneva when world trade will be the main issue with agriculture at the top of the agenda.  There will be severe pressure from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and South America to proceed on a free trade basis with minimal subsidies and subsidised payments.</P>
    <P>The Government can create an environment to stimulate development and expansion.  The seaside resort scheme was introduced when I had the privilege of being a Cabinet Minister.  It was designed by Government to create an environment to stimulate investment, job creation and wealth to improve people's lives.  That is part of the policy objective of the Western Development Commission.  That scheme was a success in many areas and was too successful in some areas.  A proper balance must be struck.  If the Government creates the necessary environment and incentive, the authorities dealing with the consequences of that, the planning authorities, need to be imaginative in the way they implement such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Westport is a beautiful seaside town.  The value of commercial planning applications granted by Westport UDC in 1994 was of the order of £8 million.  The seaside resort scheme was introduced in 1995 which increased the value to £15 million.  In 1996 the commercial value of planning applications issued in that confined space increased to £27 million.  Those planning permissions were granted by the local authority, the consequence of which was an enormous <Col N="1477" /> explosion in investment.  There may be complaints that too many private houses which are not occupied on a full-time basis have been bought in the town.  However, as time goes on and the families of these buyers use the houses, it becomes a more filled out operation.</P>
    <P>My point relates to the requirement of the planning authorities to properly use the environment created by a Government decision.  The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is interested in sustainable development.  Anybody who has ever driven from Newport to Achill will have seen on the right hand side of the road in Mulranny, a small, beautiful seaside village, the remains of the old Great Southern Hotel which subsequently became the Great Western Hotel.  It was a magnificent building from the last century with a huge facade overlooking the bay and the harbour in a beautiful location, but it went to rack and ruin over the years and is now derelict.  A number of years ago it was bought by a consortium including a lead proposer from Germany.</P>
    <P>Mulranny was included in the Achill part of the seaside resorts scheme for investment and stimulation. The group put together a plan to create a unique European centre for education and leisure and spent in excess of £100,000 on drawing up plans for the development of the old hotel, ancillary facilities, apartments, etc.  It was a major project and Mayo County Council as the planning authority dealt with it at considerable length.  It asked a huge range of questions about various aspects of the project and eventually granted permission for the proposal.  In terms of sustainable development, the complex could have created 150 or 200 jobs in the locality.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, An Taisce objected to the development on the basis that the removal of some trees on the hillside would be &ldquo;obtrusive on the landscape&rdquo;.  The consequence was that when the An Taisce objection went to An Bord Pleanála, the entire project was shot down.  The proposer spent in excess of £100,000 on his plans and dealt with every matter raised by the county council, which worked in close co-operation with him because it wanted this type of development in the area.  All aspects had been agreed and although I understand the responsibilities of An Bord Pleanála, the result of its independent and outside decision was that the entire project was stopped.  There is now on the landscape in Mulranny an obtrusive derelict building.  It is 100 years old and an eyesore.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Western Development Commission in its policy formulation will have any facilitating role in ensuring that an organisation or State body, such as An Bord Pleanála, can state that a project is too big and ask that the size or number of elements be reduced.  It could include conditions, such as the condition attached to the project I mentioned in relation to the trees, and allow proposals to proceed, if not on their original scale at least on a scale that would be sustainable, economic and create jobs.  This type of decision requires the legislation covering An <Col N="1478" /> Bord Pleanála to be reconsidered.  The board should be entitled to state that it will not give permission for the full proposal but will allow certain elements and the developer can proceed if he or she wishes.</P>
    <P>When the hotel I mentioned was built 100 years ago, there were no trees on the hill.  The pro-posers of the project intended to be careful with the surrounding sensitive environment by planting trees and improving the area.  However, because An Taisce, in its legitimate right to appeal, said it would be obtrusive on the landscape, the area is now saddled with an eyesore in the middle of a beautiful village and there is probably no prospect of the project proceeding any further.  If the commission is to liaise on policy matters with county councils and strategy committees, there should be a facility for An Bord Pleanála to be pragmatic in its decisions and not shoot down major proposals for sustainable development in an area as delicate, sensitive and impoverished as that location in the context of income.  This aspect needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the major requirement of water, sewerage and other facilities. It is a sad fact that unless the local sewerage scheme in every small town is bursting to overflowing, it is difficult for their local authorities to get money from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for expansion or extensions.  One assumes there is an overall long-term plan in terms of where expansion should take place.  However, county and town development plans are slow to proceed and things can change overnight.  For example, three weeks ago the local newspaper in Castlebar detailed applications for more than 300 houses.  In the next five years, there may be 1,200 or 1,500 extra houses in the locality and there is no planning to cater for that level of development in terms of water and sewerage facilities, footpaths, etc.</P>
    <P>I recall the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, telling me regarding the expansion of Intel in Leixlip that the roof was so big that it took up the entire waste water allocation from the Department for one year.  If a Shannon corridor is created and people want to invest as a consequence in small towns which at present are falling into the river, the requirement for water and sewerage facilities will be huge.  A coherence in planning is required by making a certain amount of money available over the next five years to cater for developments.  This is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I read recently about a major gas find off Achill in the deep water of the Corrib trough in the Atlantic.  Other wells need to be dug at a cost of several million pounds each.  The Western Development Commission should be in a position to respond if the operation is found to be commercial under licence by the company involved. It should consider the lead-in time if a situation like that in the North Sea will arise, where there was no planning at the correct time.  The commission should consider where onshore developments <Col N="1479" /> would take place as a consequence of a major find if it is deemed to be commercial.  A position should not arise where the company suddenly discovers there is a vast reservoir of gas which can be taken ashore, but the necessary local plans have not been made.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission should lead planning for such operations.  The money provided for it is a pittance in terms of what is required, but it is a start.  The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, can legitimately tell the commission that it will receive £2 million this year and £5 million next year but it must prove what it can do.  Lofty principles can be churned out of any floppy disc but the commission should be asked to identify the real action and its leadership role in driving economic expansion in the seven western counties.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Doherty's contribution, a European Union national who lives on an island came to see me some time ago.  An ISDN telephone was supplied to him for his business and he told me that he has the best of both worlds. He can do all his programming and setting work from home on the island.  Instead of having to go to Europe three times a month, he now only has to go every three months because he can do all his work from his house.</P>
    <P>Every local authority or commission should acquire 200 or 300 acres of land in each county and create a digital park as its central focus.  It should have prezoned areas for industrial development, light or heavy, so firms coming to Ireland from Silicone Valley or elsewhere do not have to wait two years for planning permission only to discover that somebody else may object to it, when they can go to Holland, Scotland or elsewhere in Europe and receive planning permission within three weeks.  It would be worth following such a policy of pre-planning for industry to move people out of Dublin to work in less congested areas.  It would be of assistance if the Minister of State could promote in America greenfield sites pre-zoned for industrial use, including light industry, software and digital parks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and offer the Minister of State my full support.  I hope the Bill will be a success and that the principles set out in relation to investment will be followed by a Government decision on Objective One status which would allow the commission and the Department to prove their worth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister of State on the enthusiastic way he has pursued the matter since taking office. The people whom he met recently in Lisdoonvarna were impressed by his knowledge of the issues involved.  It is his intention to introduce speedily the necessary incentives to resolve the problems being experienced in the west.  I also compliment Deputy Donal Carey who made a strong case for the inclusion of County Clare within the remit of the commission when Minister <Col N="1480" /> of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. Because of the social and economic problems being experienced, especially in the western part of the county, which to date have evaded all solutions, it should benefit enormously from its inclusion.  The Minister of State indicated that the county will be represented on the board of the commission.  This should ensure the associated benefits will be spread more evenly.</P>
      <P>There is an ageing population in the northern and western parts of the county where many people live on their own in isolated areas.  The population of townlands such as Gleninagh declined by over 33 per cent in the period 1971 to 1991.  The population of Carron in the Burren, one of the most attractive areas in the country, declined by over 30 per cent in the same period. The dependency ratio in some electoral divisions is 20 per cent above the national average.  This has major implications in terms of population structure.  The numbers leaving the land, small holdings in particular, continue to increase. Because of the economic situation more and more are seeking employment in agri-tourism or alternative enterprises while continuing to farm part time.  The commission should consider urgently how this trend can be reversed.  The industrial development agencies, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Leader companies have concentrated on attracting outside investment and the creation of small enterprises at the expense of the development of agri-tourism and agri-business to which little, if any, attention has been paid.</P>
      <P>The population of towns such as Kilrush has also declined.  Large numbers of young people have left and many buildings, some associated with the flour milling industry, lie derelict.  The urban renewal scheme should be utilised to attract substantial investment.  The scheme has had a major impact on the economic and social life of Ennis where it has been operational for a number of years.  Ennis is thriving as a result.  The decentralisation of Government offices has also had an impact.  An extension of the scheme could result in the revitalisation of Kilrush which in turn would have an impact on the areas mentioned. For the local elections seats have been lost from Loop Head to Galway Bay because of depopulation. Kilrush Chamber of Commerce and others have been pressing for over a year to have urban renewal status extended to certain areas to attract the necessary investment to revitalise the town. Tourism has had a major impact through the development of marina and leisure facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years Bord Fáilte has been strongly criticised for not paying more attention to remote areas.  The resorts had been the backbone of the tourism business.  Tourism has increased dramatically in recent years but at the same time the resorts have gone into decline.  I welcome the resort renewal scheme in so far as it applies to Kilkee and Lahinch.  Two major hotel complexes are under way in Kilkee at a total cost of approximately £16 million &mdash; £8 million to replace the <Col N="1481" /> old Atlantic Hotel and another £8 million for a new hotel on the Kilrush Road.  These are major developments by any standards and they would not be under way were it not for the resort renewal scheme.  Not only do I wish to see that scheme continued but I would like it to be extended to other towns such as Lisdoonvarna, which has campaigned strongly for it and Scariff which currently does not even have a hotel.</P>
    <P>We were surprised that Clare did not qualify for benefit under the hotels scheme announced some time ago where certain areas were deemed eligible for hotel development incentives.  Some areas with no hotels have a large tourism business. Scariff is the angling centre of the lake district of east Clare, a very attractive area on Lough Derg with excellent lakes for angling and coarse fishing.  It is inexplicable that such areas were not included because it might have resulted in an increase in tourism.  The agriculture industry will not sustain the population in these areas.  In fact, there will be a continuing decline and for that reason it is vitally important that resorts like Lahinch and Kilkee continue in the resort renewal scheme and the scheme is extended to some other areas.  It is equally important that the urban renewal scheme discussions currently under way in Brussels are expedited so that towns like Kilrush can be included before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There has been enormous interest in these issues from local voluntary organisations, chambers of commerce, etc., which are currently seeking assistance from Government.  This commission will help enormously if it puts its weight behind these campaigns.  The Government can play a major part in this and it would be unwise for the Department of Finance to take the view that it will lose some minor revenues by giving incentives to areas which are struggling to survive and where there are derelict buildings, vacant factories, locked up houses, mass emigration and unemployment as well as other problems which need to be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the necessity to provide infrastructural facilities in some towns and villages.  It is appalling that at a time when the tourism business is expanding, with people willing to invest heavily in it, villages like Quilty still do not have a basic sewerage system.  I have suggested to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that it might be possible to frame an arrangement whereby companies could invest in the provision of these services if proper incentives were put in place for them.  When the Government had a problem in recent years in relation to the provision of accommodation for the decentralisation programme, a scheme was devised by the Commissioners of Public Works where suitable buildings were designed, built and financed by local builders and financial companies. Excellent offices were built in Ennis and Limerick under that scheme and similar prototypes could be put in place for the provision of sewerage services in small villages like Quilty, which has a thriving tourism business.  With a little <Col N="1482" /> imagination on the part of the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Finance, builders and financiers might be willing to provide these services on the same basis as the Government offices were built under the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>I have made a submission to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and he should give it favourable consideration because otherwise facilities such as sewerage facilities for small villages will not be provided during our lifetime. They can be provided easily and in a way that will give employment as well as provide the basic facilities needed.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this organisation does not duplicate the work of other organisations.  It is essential that the organisation sets out clearly its own co-ordinating role to bring together the various organisations.  At the moment, one organisation does not appear to know what the other is doing. With so many organisations such as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, county enterprise boards, Leader programmes, enterprise committees of one kind or another and partnership companies, it is vital that there will not be any overlapping or duplication among these organisations.</P>
    <P>The members of the new board have an opportunity to ensure that the various strands are drawn together and that there will be concerted action to deal with trouble spots in these areas.  I have mentioned areas in which there has been an enormous decline in population but other areas are thriving such as the town of Ennis.  It is vital that the commission directs its attention to problem areas and puts effective policies in place to deal with them.</P>
    <P>On the section which gives power to set up subcommittees to deal with various issues, it would be a mistake if this body were to set up a series of subcommittees because the impact of the organisation might be lost.  I strongly urge the body not to divide the organisation into too many units.  Much action is expected from this body and we do not want to see it as simply another talking shop where decisions will be put on the long finger.  It certainly should not waste time and resources studying issues that have been studied inside out.  There are numerous reports and studies at the disposal of the Departments and organisations to enable them avoid duplication of effort and research.</P>
    <P>We want to see speedy action taken to deal with the trouble spots which are easily identifiable and reverse the trend which has devastated the west.  If action is not taken quickly, we will see a series of closures of small villages which will be on a par with what happened in the famine period.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has taken such a keen interest in this area.  I hope that with the help of this new agency he will transform the face of rural Ireland and revitalise the small towns and villages which are crying out for action <Col N="1483" /> to be taken to deal with the decline they have seen over the past 20 to 25 years.</P>

      <P>I am happy to see the Bill before the House.  It took a long time to get here despite the fact that I raised it on the Order of Business every morning.  The Taoiseach assured me in Ballina some weeks ago that my raising the matter on the Order of Business helped to bring the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The reason the Western Development Commission is being set up goes back to the bishops' initiative many years ago and to the &ldquo;Developing the West Together&rdquo; initiative.  There were many meetings in halls during winter nights when people told the bishops and public representatives of problems in their areas.  I am glad Deputy Bruton set up the Western Development Commission when Taoiseach and I am delighted this Government is putting it on a statutory basis.  We welcome these developments.  However, why did it take two years and five months to set this up?  Why did it take seven years and 12 weeks since the bishops' initiative to get this Bill to the Dáil?  The Government is now in office for 16 months and it took that long to get the Bill to the House, though we welcome it now.</P>
      <P>We know it took the threatened resignation of the chief executive of the Western Development Commission to have this Bill introduced.  Many public representatives have highlighted the plight of the west over the years.  I know that Deputies from Dublin and elsewhere will say that Deputies from the west are always crying and looking for something.  Some of them are at it now.  A union delegation has gone to Brussels today to inform the European Commission why we should not have regionalisation of Objective One status.</P>
      <P>Every report that has been sent to Government for the past 20 years has shown what has been happening to the west, but it took the previous Government and this one to recognise serious problems such as depopulation in the west.  Every report has shown that the west has a decreasing population while the population of other parts of the country is decreasing &mdash; that speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our rail service has suffered.  There is an excellent rail line from Dublin to Athlone.  I am not sure where the line stops in Athlone; perhaps it is at the Minister for Public Enterprise's house. However, the line to Westport does not stop at my house, and that causes problems for me. Westerners have always been treated as second class citizens.  I hope the forthcoming budget will allocate funds to upgrade the Athlone to Westport rail line.  Political pressure did not put this item on the agenda.  A serious accident occurred in Knockcroghery in Roscommon some months <Col N="1484" /> ago and we were lucky 20 or 30 people were not killed.  It was a miracle that the accident did not happen on a Friday or Sunday evening.  If it had we would have spent many weeks debating what had happened.  Now the Government and Iarnróid Éireann have been warned and I hope action will be taken on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have to travel to Dublin three or four times a week, and I have no problem getting to Dublin once I reach Longford, as the Longford to Dublin road is perfect.  However, the road from Westport through Charlestown to Longford is a disgrace.  I compliment the Minister of State that at least this commission will be a statutory agency under his control.  We will be able to ask the Minister of State questions about it rather than being told to write to the chief executive.  I hope the Minister of State will answer those questions and that we will not have a situation like that of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>I looked up the <i>Nealon's Guide to the 28th Dáil and Seanad</i> recently to see what party the National Roads Authority represented and how many Dáil Deputies were on the board.  I was amazed to find there was not one representative from that body in the Dáil or on a local authority. Yet that body's recent report stated that no money will be spent on the Longford to Westport road for the next ten years.  The money is to be spent in and around Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is where we are elected to, where we represent the people and where Ministers should be able to answer questions.  It upsets me to see Ministers run off to different parts of the country to make announcements about legislation.  This is the first place for announcements to be made and I hope to see that happen more often.  This is why people say politicians do not count.  We can only blame ourselves because we try to take away every bit of authority we have.</P>
    <P>Regarding employment, the IDA does not really care about regionalisation.  Its work is done once it gets jobs into the country.  However, Mr. Kieran McGowan and the IDA have failed the west, with the exception of Galway city.  Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo have been neglected. Many jobs could have been set up in Erris, Belmullet, Ballina or Killala, but everything was pushed into the cities.</P>
    <P>Every morning on the Order of Business and the radio all we hear about is the gridlock in Dublin, people cannot get to work and they cannot get home.  Who created the gridlock?  Past Governments did because they could not put enough into Dublin.  Where is the 100 metre swimming pool to be put?  In Dublin.  Why can it not be located in Cavan, Mayo or Roscommon?  We should be given a break.  Croke Park and Lansdowne Road are in Dublin, as is everything else, and people wonder why there is gridlock. Presumably for the next ten years all Exchequer money will have to be used to relieve Dublin's gridlock.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour think there is no place other than Dublin.  There are other <Col N="1485" /> places, like Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  These areas need a slice of the national cake they did not get in the past, and they will probably not get it in the future unless Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies from the west get together to tell the Taoiseach of the day, be it Deputy Bruton or Deputy Ahern, that they will not support his Government unless their area gets its fair share.  That day is not far away. The electorate will look for people who will represent them and who will deliver to their constituencies. Regarding State services, a recent report showed that half the primary schools in Achill will have to close because there will be nobody to fill them.</P>
    <P>A union delegation went to Brussels today to discuss Structural Funds.  The west probably does not count because it does not have as many people employed as other areas.  Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Democratic Left Deputies have said that this matter will affect the rest of the country. I was in Brussels with Fine Gael colleagues last week and I was sorry I did not go sooner, as I learned a lot about Objective One status.</P>
    <P>By granting Objective One status to the west, midlands and Border regions two thirds of the funds will be available for those areas.  If we go into a transitional phase one third of the funds will be available for the rest of the country.  It will not affect one area in Dublin or anywhere else.  I know there are black spots in Dublin, Limerick and elsewhere but every report and all statistics show that the west has been neglected and has not received its fair share of Structural Funds.  We are not out with the begging bowl nor are we looking for more than anyone else.  All we ask is for the retention of Objective One status for the west, midlands and Border counties to bring us in line with everyone else.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission is to receive £25 million in funding.  We were told at one stage that the budget would be £100 million. I do not know what has happened to the other £75 million.  However, I do not want to sound negative.  The commission is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government makes its decision on its approach to Objective One status this week because the message from Europe last week was that all applications would be expected to be received six months before a decision is made in March.  It is now D-Day and the Government must make its decision, which is not an easy one. Deputies are under pressure and I am sure the Tánaiste and her party will not want to see much money being given to the west, even though it has lost 10 per cent of its population in the past 40 years while that of the rest of the country has risen by 28 per cent, something which speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Not everything about the west is negative.  It probably has some of the most beautiful country-side in the world.  It also has a wonderful workforce who are prepared to work in diverse areas and who can do what is required of them.  In <Col N="1486" /> Westport, Allergan employs up to 1,000 people. It has now moved its European headquarters to the town.  Baxter in Castlebar employs 600 to 700 people.  Volex is also located there.  We in the west have not been afraid to work and there have been no strikes or other problems in these companies so they are delighted to be located there. We have good facilities; all that is needed is the infrastructure and a little assistance.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Docklands Authority, something about which I never complain, is due to receive £500 million in funding.  We from the west did not say it should not receive such funding, even though the people in the area have been moved out to other parts of Dublin to make way for beautiful hotels and apartments, which will eventually cause more gridlock.  All we want is our fair share and to be given a chance.</P>
    <P>Over the years, those who have represented the area &mdash; bishops, politicians, ordinary people &mdash;&mdash; have been disheartened as they campaigned for the necessary infrastructure to keep young people living in the west.  There is nothing worse than to see busloads of young people on a Sunday evening heading for Galway, Sligo, Dublin and Letterkenny.  The trouble is that, once they go, they do not return.  They are educated to leave our area and that is sad.  Some of them would love to live, work and rear their families there but cannot do so because the jobs and infrastructure are not in place.  Had there been decentralisation at an earlier stage, many Departments and State agencies could have moved to the west but that did not happen because everything had to be in Dublin.</P>
    <P>County councils are similar to central Government in that they want to retain all services in the county town.  Belmullet is 75 miles from Castlebar. If one were to travel twice that distance from Castlebar, one would be in Dublin.  People in Belmullet must travel to Castlebar for hospital services or to renew their car tax.  All State agencies are in Castlebar.  Why does the county council not locate a motor taxation office in Belmullet?  It would create a few jobs in the area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is successful because it is our last chance.  I am delighted the commission will be under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture and Food although I wish it were the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach. An understanding was given to the people of the west many years ago that all State agencies, such as IDA Ireland and the National Roads Authority, would report to the Taoiseach on what they gave to the west, Border and midlands.  It is probable that the Civil Service ensured responsibility for the west was moved from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  If Kieran McGowan or the chairman of the National Roads Authority had to report to the Taoiseach who, in turn, had to report to the House where questions would be asked about what funding was given to roads in the west and what jobs were given to the region, there would be red faces in the Department of <Col N="1487" /> the Taoiseach, IDA Ireland and the National Roads Authority.  These people should be answerable to the House and it is wrong that they are not.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed public representatives will not be allowed on the Western Development Commission and that membership will only last three years.  We do not want the cronies of political parties on the board.  Neither do we want people who have gained good experience resigning their positions after three years.  There should be a structure whereby members resign at different times because they will have gained considerable experience in three years.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Donal Carey on his work as Minister of State with responsibility for western development.  The last Government recognised there was need for such a Minister.  This Government failed to appoint a Deputy from Connacht as a senior Minister, the first time that has happened since the foundation of the State. That speaks for itself.  Neither did it appoint a junior Minister with responsibility for western development who actually comes from the west. No disrespect is meant to the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who, coming from Tipperary, will look after his own little patch.  However, he would not have the same understanding and love of or commitment to the west as someone from the area.  The Government failed in this respect. Furthermore, it moved the commission from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Agriculture and Food and that is bad for the future of the Western Development Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be no more reports on the west.  We do not need the problems of the area restated because the Government and the State agencies know what they are.  I hope the commission will not be a talking shop and that it will deliver jobs to the west and assistance to those who need it to set up in business.  I do not want a situation similar to what is happening with the Leader programme and the county enterprise boards where feasibility studies are carried out and grants given, even for major hotels owned by companies which could buy out the Government, such is the amount of money they have.  We should try to help people who cannot be assisted by other agencies and encourage people to locate in the west.  We all love the region and want to see it develop.  I hope the Bill is successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has its genesis in the Developing the West Together initiative and I commend Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for his efforts.  The widespread support from all parties for this Bill indicates that he was correct to take time to ensure the best possible outcome.  Such support is unusual, particularly in recent days.  The Bill illustrates the commitment of this and previous Governments to the west.  It may have taken longer than it should <Col N="1488" /> have, but it is now happening and it heralds a new era in which I have great confidence.</P>
      <P>Lack of finance has always beset initiatives such as this in the past.  Local authorities and other agencies uttered the mantra of insufficient funding as the reason for lack of development. This problem was illustrated by the many Deputies who highlighted infrastructural deficiencies in areas such as water and sewerage. It would be a pity if this initiative was to falter because of lack of funding.  The amount provided seems generous but it must be remembered that the return on this investment will ensure that it is more than self-financing.  If this initiative generates the momentum of which it is capable, that must be matched by funding.  Funding must not become a brake on progress.</P>
      <P>Despite the negative comments that people have made about the west, there is enormous potential in the region.  We can afford to be more positive about the region than we have been heretofore. This initiative has a potential which has not been realised by its initiators and promoters and I hope that that is how it will develop.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a belated attempt to establish a form of regional development which has always been fundamental to the development of the regions and the economic well-being of the country. There have been rural development pilot schemes, but this integrated approach is long overdue.  It is welcome and I wish it every success.</P>
      <P>An illustration of the need for this initiative is the fact that incomes in the west are about 64 per cent of the European average.  This proves that transfers of European funds have not benefited the area sufficiently, mainly due to the population criteria attached to the disbursement of such funds.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Partnership Board produced a report called The Challenge: A Positive Future Through Action.  I like the inclusion of the word &ldquo;positive&rdquo; in the title of the document and its emphasis on action.  Action is what is required.</P>
      <P>The report identified three main areas of need. First is the need to harness the high level of expertise and support systems which already exist in the west to produce self-sustainable development. This is important as we have too frequently tended to look abroad for the supports necessary to develop the lifestyles to which we aspire.  We have overlooked our indigenous strengths.  One of the successes of this document is that it pin-pointed the importance of building on the existing expertise and support systems in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also highlighted to need to build new partnership models and to create vibrant economic and social development models.  In particular, it focused on the local, county and regional levels.  We have tended to have strong county models involving local authorities and other organisations.  In some instances the local level has also been strong, such as parish and GAA structures.  However, in other areas the local structure has been poor.  The county model <Col N="1489" /> has served to diminish the potential of local community developments.  The report also examined regional structures at which we have always been weakest.  We now find that we must accelerate regional development in order to pursue Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The third requirement highlighted by the development board's report is the need to broaden the investment base.  This is the issue on which we have always concentrated.  We have traditionally looked for foreign investment and frequently overlooked the potential for indigenous development in western communities and other parts of the country.  The commission has a huge job to do if it is to address the threefold challenge posed in The Challenge: A Positive Future Through Action.  The commission can be enormously successful if it approaches its task in the manner suggested by the report.</P>
    <P>Roimh an Toghchán anuraidh bhí mé ar chlár teilifíse &mdash; ar TnaG ag caint ar an ábhar seo. Dúirt mé ar an gclár sin go raibh feirmeoireacht agus talamhaíocht níos tábhachtaí b'fhéidir ná mar a bhí riamh.  Thosaigh an lucht éisteachta agus an lucht féachana ag gáire fúm mar níor chreid siad gur féidir dul chun cinn a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí talmhaíochta.  Creidim féin gur féidir agus creidim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach ar fad go néireoidh linn é sin a dhéanamh.  Bhéinn buartha muna mbeadh an Coimisiún ag tabhairt go leor aire do chúrsaí talmhaíochta agus ag cur brú ar an Roinn ar fud na tíre an talamhaíocht a chur chun cinn chomh mór agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil baol ann go bhfuilimid ag brath ró-mhor ar thurasóireacht.  Níor éirigh linn go dtí seo dul chun cinn eacnamaíochta a dhéanamh ar an mbonn sin.  Ba mhór an trua dá dtarlódh sin mar creidim gurb é an rud is fearr atá ann chun na daoine a choimeád sa bhaile agus ioncam a thabhairt dóibh ná go mbeadh an fheirmeoireacht agus an talamhaíocht i bhfad níos láidre ná mar atá siad faoi láthair.  Creidim gur féidir sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the response of some members of the audience on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday.  There seemed to be an artificial division between the elected representatives, Deputies Moffatt and Kenny, and also among the audience.  One member of the audience appeared to suggest that the need to pursue Objective One status and other initiatives needed in the west was prompted by local development groups and was not initiated or supported by politicians. It would be a pity if that was widely believed to be the case.  My experience of Deputies and councillors in the west is that they have been to the fore in pursuing such initiatives. Unfortunately, when doing so they tended to attract less publicity than the value of what they were saying warranted.</P>
    <P>Almost all speakers have referred to Objective One status and we all realise the importance of this issue.  It is ironic that the three regions mentioned for inclusion include most of the western development area, but exclude County Clare <Col N="1490" /> which is in the mid-west.  It would be extraordinary if County Clare was deemed suitable for inclusion in the Western Development Commission area but not for Objective One status. That is an issue that must be looked at carefully because it has the potential to create difficulties, not only for County Clare, but for a range of activities which the commission may be pursuing as part of its work.</P>
    <P>While GDP in the mid-west region is high relative to the rest of the country, a substantial element of that is from jobs provided by foreign companies who immediately repatriate a huge amount of their profits.  The difference between GDP and GNP is substantial.  Were the latter to be used as the criterion the area would not meet the criteria required.  There is a danger when there is a huge dependence on one or two speciality areas of production, that any downturn in, for instance, the computer area in Limerick, could have a devastating effect on the economy.  It appears, once Objective One status has been established, that whatever downturn an excluded region might suffer, it would subsequently be excluded.  This is a matter that needs to be looked at carefully.  It could also be looked at in terms of an IDA policy of clustering similar type industries in a particular region.  It is not unknown for a type of industry to suffer a severe downturn with consequent, sometimes substantial, job losses in the one region.  From all planning viewpoints that is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the need to address the over population of Dublin and the declining population in the west.  The magnet which attracts people to Dublin is the availability of employment. Unless there is a national policy of regionalisation of jobs, the spread to which many of us aspire, becomes impossible.  As Deputy Seán Doherty and others have said there is no reason towns in the midlands, the west, south and elsewhere ought not to be capable of attracting a great many of the major industries based in Dublin. This would have enormous advantages for the citizens of Dublin who suffer from gridlock, road rage and various other difficulties and would ensure a better quality of life for those who would remain in the capital city.  Those who would be in a position to move to the less cluttered towns of the midlands and west would also enjoy a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution by Deputy Eoin Ryan who is one of the first Dublin Deputies to realise the benefits to Dublin of adopting that approach are at least as great as those for the rest of the country.  Heretofore, the only Dublin Deputy I recall making that point was the Taoiseach. This is a matter we have discussed on a number of occasions and something to which the Taoiseach is strongly committed but for which he has not got credit from many speakers.</P>
    <P>There are many small pilot initiatives.  Mr. Jim Connolly based in Kilbaha, County Clare, has been involved with rural resettlement on a small scale.  This project requires a substantial level of <Col N="1491" /> funding.  I understand, in co-operation with the IFA, he is now operating a new scheme to reoccupy deserted rural dwellings.  This is a small element in a big picture which can be built up with the right policies.  An even greater need than housing, important though it is in Dublin, is to position jobs in the desired location.</P>
    <P>Long before that initiative, Fr. Harry Bohan, was involved in rural housing schemes.  At a time of considerable difficulty, many people expressed scepticism.  Now the vision of developing the local village community and providing housing for people there is very attractive.  Apart from anything else, it would begin to effectively address the huge cost of housing in Dublin by providing houses in areas where it costs less and where the people have the capacity to be net contributors to the community rather than detracting from the quality of life which is the experience in the capital city.</P>
    <P>The commission has enormous potential to tap into the area of technology parks attached to the institutes.  Regardless of the disadvantages the west may experience, it enjoys a considerable number of these in Athlone, Castlebar, Sligo, Letterkenny and Galway University.  The technology park at the University of Limerick, while it had small beginnings and a difficult gestation period, has become a tremendous success and has put the region at the forefront of research and development.</P>
    <P>In all areas of manufacturing industry unless research and development is at the forefront one loses out.  In the past we have erred on the side of spending too little on this.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, on the work he has done in this area.  Ireland's future depends to a huge extent on our capacity to be at the forefront of research and development.  The commission, given its opportunity to base some of its units with the institutes, has an enormous resource which it can tap successfully.</P>
    <P>Last evening I was pleased to meet a group of Iranians, guests of Deputy John Ellis, who had with them a number of personnel from Sligo Institute.  It is obvious there is potential for development and the creation of good quality jobs which we probably would not have dreamt about in the past.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the breadth of the role the commission must take on itself and about the county strategy groups that need to be established to enable the commission to do its job. Some counties have active strategy groups while others have not.  I do not know whether it is intended that the strategy groups feed into the commission at a certain level and co-operate on an ongoing basis.  I pay tribute to former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for his work in this area and to my constituency colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, who did enormous work in the two years he was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.  I do not agree with Deputy Carey that this matter should come under <Col N="1492" /> the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. The Department of Agriculture and Food continues to be the main player in western development and I am happy that Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is in that Department.  Nevertheless, excellent work was done by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the need for improved infrastructure.  I agree with Deputy Ring on the role of the National Roads Authority and the fact that much of the funding received from the EU on the basis of the low income in the west is spent in the east.</P>
    <P>There is potential to develop the railways, particularly the Limerick-Sligo line.  This may not be as expensive as suggested.  We have in the west a plethora of airports which may be detrimental to economic success &mdash; Carrickfin, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Shannon, Farranfore.  The airports in the east are Dublin, Belfast and Waterford.  Cork Airport could be included on either the east or the west.  Both the population and the economic development levels make it difficult for all these airports to be economically successful.  Nevertheless there is potential for co-operation between them which has not been tapped and the commission can play a very constructive role in this regard.  I am also worried about the plethora of bodies that already exist with which the commission will have to deal.  One of the challenges will be to bring these bodies together.  In this regard initiatives in relation to tax incentives, etc., must be directed towards as much of the region as possible and I share Deputy Daly's disappointment at the exclusion of Clare from a number of such incentives.  The commission will find such exclusion was a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an áthas orm cúpla focal a rá i leith an Bhille agus cuirim fáilte roimhe.  In January 1997 the Western Development Commission was established through the good efforts of the then Minister of State, Deputy Carey, with the objective of promoting the economic and social development of the western region.  Unfortunately for the region, there was a change of Government in June 1997 and there has been some foot-dragging since then.  Two years later we are now discussing the necessary legislation to establish the commission on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The proposed Government funding of £2 million this year and £5 million in 1999 and 2000 seems very inadequate.  I was at the original meeting in Labane Hall in south Galway when the idea for developing the west together was initiated.  The spark lit that Sunday afternoon has now become the flame which is the Bill.  The objective at the time, in co-operation with local farm and church leaders, was to come together to demand a self-sustaining economic policy which would allow people continue to live in their areas and raise their families with a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors are working against the west in terms of the provision of jobs.  Remoteness in relation to the east coast and lack of <Col N="1493" /> investment in infrastructure have been serious drawbacks over a number of years.  The lack of commitment by various Governments to an even distribution of the country's wealth and investment of capital in our region has been a major factor in the depopulation of the west over a number of years.  The establishment of the western commission will not change the situation. Rather there must be a change in the Government's attitude and mindset.  The best example of the Government's lack of commitment to the western region is its appalling neglect in not having yet applied for Objective One status for the west and Border and midland counties, the only regions qualifying for such status under EU criteria. A signal from the Government that it will make such an application would be a vote of confidence for those regions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Eoin Ryan that there is tremendous potential for the west.  There are great advantages, as well as the disadvantage of remoteness from the east coast, in the west.  It has a resilient population and a well educated young workforce coming from our universities and regional technical colleges.  We have the ability in a very good environment to attract a workforce to the west.  Deputy Ryan, a Government Deputy from Dublin, made a very interesting point when he said funding or Objective One status for the west can only alleviate the problems building up in our capital city.  If we change our mindset and thinking and provide jobs in the west, the midlands and the Border region, we will stop the population from migrating to the cities, and thus alleviate the pressure on cities such as Dublin in the provision of housing, and provide a better infrastructure to cope with the increasing number of cars, etc.  Such problems will be alleviated if we maintain the population of other regions.  Therefore, Objective One status would be good for Dublin.  A point which seems to be lost on some commentators and politicians is that receipt of Objective One status by the 13 western, midland and Border counties would not disadvantage other regions which are over the 75 per cent GDP qualification level.  The GDP figure for the rest of the country is 92 per cent while the figure for Dublin is 116 per cent.  These areas will qualify for the next highest funding, namely transitional status.  Therefore, it would be to the advantage of the entire country if the Government applied without delay for Objective One status for the qualifying region.  A large delegation of Fine Gael Deputies from the region, accompanied by Mr. Joe McCartin, MEP, met Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in Brussels last week and were astonished when she told them the Government has not yet applied for Objective One status for the region.</P>
    <P>The method by which the EU now measures qualification for Objective One funding is GDP, the cut-off point for which is 75 per cent.  It is clear that Ireland as a unit will not qualify but that the region incorporating the 13 counties will qualify as its GDP is less than 75 per cent.  During <Col N="1494" /> Question Time last week the Taoiseach said various structures will have to be established to get Objective One status for a region.  In the current phase of funding only three member states, namely, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, received funding for the entire country.  The other EU countries got Objective One status for various regions, 85 per cent of Spain, excluding the area around Madrid; the former GDR area of Germany; all regions south of Naples in Italy; a small area on the Belgian border in France; a small region on the Hungarian border in Austria and the highlands and islands of Scotland.  Therefore, the precedent clearly exists under current Structural Funds for obtaining Objective One status for a region.  It did not cause any difficulty for the administrations in the EU countries which received Objective One status for the regions which qualified.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to proceed with the application and I appeal to my colleagues and to Ministers of State from the west to support our application for regional status as we have an excellent case.  Under the current phase of funding £1.5 billion was spent in the 13 western, midland and Border counties while £3.6 billion was spent in the other 13 counties.  Therefore, the western region is getting only half the amount being spent in the other regions.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Shatter is essentially a matter of accounting and, as such, would be dealt with by my officials.  This matter was not raised specifically with me, but taken by finance unit officials of my Department as a normal operational matter.  The matter is covered in a comprehensive way by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report on my Department's 1997 appropriation accounts.</P>
      <P>In summary, my officials were faced with a very difficult situation in relation to a particular reimbursement of £20 million from the UK Department of Health.  The UK authorities initiated a review of the recoupment methodology in 1996. There were unresolved issues associated with this review which made the calculation of the net liability of the UK authorities somewhat uncertain during 1997.  The situation was further compounded arising from the change in the calendar for the public finances in 1997.  These changes resulted in a more streamlined process and the moving forward of the 1997 Supplementary Estimate, the agreeing of the abridged Estimates for 1998 and the bringing forward of the date for the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the new deadlines and having regard to the uncertainty surrounding the UK liability, my officials were unable to agree final figures with their UK colleagues and thereby applied a prudent approach to appropriations-in-aid receipts, projecting a sum lower than the eventual total reimbursement.</P>
      <P>There were few options open to my officials for dealing with this matter.  The figure in respect of the 1997 Supplementary Estimate and the 1998 abridged book were agreed by Government well in advance of knowing the total UK liability.  Following full and careful consideration, and with the objective of dealing with the matter in a fair and transparent manner, it was decided to take this exceptional item into the 1998 accounting period.  In choosing this, my officials were conscious that the funding is, in the first instance, given by the UK authorities to defray the cost of providing services to their citizens.  Therefore, it was imperative for my Department that the £20 million in question was seen to be benefiting the health services.  I am satisfied that the manner in which this was eventually treated fully achieved this objective.</P>
      <P>In the case of this Department's dealings with the Central Bank, my officials spoke to officials there in order to fully understand the process of receiving and clearing such payments.</P>

If the Deputy reads in full the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he will be aware that where there is a disagreement or difference of opinion between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the line Department, advice is usually sought from the Department of Finance. The report states that in cases of disagreement between an accounting officer, the Secretary General and the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to the accounting treatment of transactions, it is customary to obtain the views of the Department of Finance which has overall repsonsibility for public financial procedures. Accordingly, the Comptroller and Auditor General sought the views of the Secretary General of the Department of Finance in relation to the accounting treatment of the receipt and whether it should have been accounted for in the 1997 appropriation account.</P>
      <P>In response to the first issue, the Department of Finance stated that it had not previously been informed or consulted about the matter but, had it been, it would have been obliged to advise that it should have been brought to account promptly in line with the provisions of public financial procedures. In response to the second issue, the Department stated it was conscious the appropriations account is a cash-based record of receipts and payments compared with the Estimate provision in the year in question.  Accordingly, the Department of Finance was not convinced that at that stage a receipt brought to account in January 1998 should have been recorded as an appropriation-in-aid in the appropriation accounts of 1997.  In other words, the Department of Finance was not convinced that the Comptroller and Auditor General's view was the correct one in this case.  The Department of Finance was of the view that it was preferable to deal with the receipt in the context of the 1998 accounts.</P>
      <P>This issue relates to technical adjustments conducted by the finance unit and accounting officer and the Department is satisfied the matter was dealt with properly and in good faith.  The incident related to a particular, once-off difficulty which is unlikely to occur again.  In effect, the £20 million will be available in respect of supplementary funding in the current year.  Members will see this in a transparent manner when we are considering the 1998 Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer and his view of whether accounting procedures have been properly followed should ultimately be complied with. <Col N="1497" /> Does the Minister accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's statement that one of the fundamental principles on which accounting is based is substance, not form?  Does the Minister accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's opinion that the failure to include a sum of £20 million as appropriations-in-aid in 1997 meant the Vote did not reflect the Department's full financial position?  Does the Minister agree that it is in the public and national interest that when Departments account to this House for expenditure and financial inputs, the House should be able to rely on the accounts as being accurate and not be placed in the position where they must second guess whether a particular Department is concealing the existence of funds received by it?  In this case, £20 million was received by the Central Bank on 16 December which the Minister's officials failed to inform the bank to transfer to departmental accounts.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the extent of the problem of the shortage of nursing staff throughout the health services; his views on the underlying reasons for these shortages; and the steps, if any, he is taking to deal with this urgent problem.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 May 1998, a total of 57, 317 nurses were registered with An Bord Altranais. Of these, 47,863 were on the board's live register. The number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased steadily in recent years.  Between 1990 and 31 December 1997, the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in the public health service funded directly by my Department increased from 24,732 to 27, 426, an increase of 2,694 or 11 per cent.</P>
      <P>Over recent years the traditional apprenticeship model of pre-registration nursing education has been replaced by a new diploma-based programme. Nursing students on the new programme are supernumerary to service requirements. The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; student nurses' service contribution is being replaced by an appropriate skill mix of qualified nurses and other grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these changes in arrangements for professional training, there is an underlying trend away from less qualified student nurses to fully qualified staff nurses.  Another factor which <Col N="1498" /> should be taken into account is the increasing trend in recent years among health service employers to facilitate nurses who, for personal reasons, do no wish to commit themselves to full-time work.  There are now nearly 4,000 nurses working in formal job-sharing arrangements, in addition to the significant number who work part-time.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, I have asked my officials to keep the overall issue of the availability of nurses under review and to examine with health service employers whether any special initiatives are required in relation to recruitment. I am aware there is a difficulty in recruiting staff in acute hospitals, care of the elderly service, psychiatric and mental health handicap services. The shortage, however, is not evenly distributed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not unique in having a shortage of nurses.  The United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Many of these countries are experiencing a serious decline in the number of applicants for general nurse training.  While this is not yet the case in Ireland, we must not become complacent about the number of applicants for training as we have a declining school-leaving population who have a greater range of third level courses to choose from than ever before.</P>
    <P>In response to the current difficulties, the Health Service Employers Agency has established a task group to examine the full nature and extent of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.  My Department is awaiting the outcome of those deliberations.  The HSEA will be holding a seminar next week on the question of nursing shortages.  The seminar will provide a very broad overview of the extent of the nursing shortage, the main reasons underlying it and the range of measures being implemented by health service employers to address the issue.</P>
    <P>I might add that last year a new Nursing Policy Division was established in my Department.  Its primary function is to ensure that there is an integrated and strengthened nursing function within my Department at this important stage in the development of nursing.</P>
    <P>In the coming months a number of nurse researchers will be appointed to the division.  One of these researchers will be specifically engaged to research nursing manpower needs for the coming years.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, my Department undertook a concerted campaign to attract more entrants to nurse training.  While the position on general nurse training is still satisfactory, there were difficulties in recruiting students for the psychiatric nursing registration/diploma programme.  A seminar to examine the issues in relation to the recruitment of psychiatric nursing students and to make recommendations on future action will be held on Friday, 23 October.  All agencies involved <Col N="1499" /> in the provision of psychiatric nursing education and training will be represented at this seminar which is being organised by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department is also engaged in discussion with An Bord Altranais on the development of further promotional literature and video materials for use in an ongoing recruitment drive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware the board of management of Tallaght Hospital has had discussions with officers of my Department with regard to the budgetary difficulties facing it. This issue is, in the first instance, a matter for the hospital.  The Deputy will be aware of the determination process which is now in place in making allocations to all health agencies, whereby service plans must be submitted to my Department within approved levels of funding.  The hospital is now saying it has cost more to open the new hospital at Tallaght than was envisaged when it submitted its service plan earlier this year and it has advised my Department of some immediate steps which it is taking to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital's outturn for the month of July 1998, which was its first full month in operation at its new site in Tallaght, showed a significant overrun against budget and the board of management, having been asked to review the figures, <Col N="1503" /> confirmed the hospital's budgetary difficulties on 24 September last.  As Minister, I am extremely concerned at the degree of the projected deficit for 1998 which has been presented and the reasons given for the overrun.</P>
    <P>I was pleased when the board of management set 21 June last as the opening day for the new hospital and every possible support was given by my Department and many of the health agencies in Dublin to support the hospital in achieving this date.  I am particularly appreciative of the enormous effort made by the staff of the hospital at all levels to ensure the smooth and safe transfer of patients to the new hospital and the commencement of services at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>However, it is vital that the hospital now establishes itself on a proper footing at Tallaght.  It is for that reason I have initiated an independent review of the data recently submitted by the board of management.  This review, which will be carried out in the context of the recent merger of the base hospitals and the move to Tallaght, will also examine the arrangements within the organisation for service planning and associated staffing and financial budgets.  The review will also look at the process, systems and practices for reporting and control.  It is expected the review will be completed within three weeks.</P>
    <P>I am trying to work with the hospital's board of management in addressing its current difficulties and I acknowledge the positive attitude taken by the board, which is in full agreement with the review I have initiated.  The board has also confirmed the full co-operation of the hospital in this review and I have agreed that the report and recommendations will be made available by me to the board.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance which I attach to ensuring this newest hospital in the health services is established quickly.  The people of Tallaght and the catchment area have waited too long for this fine facility.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it is critical that problems arising at this time are dealt with as early and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister finally acknowledge that, as I stated to him in this House at the beginning of the year, the financial allocation made by him for Tallaght Hospital for this year fell short by about £20 million?  Will he accept the chickens are now coming home to roost and that any difficulties being experienced by Tallaght Hospital derive from his failure to allocate sufficient funding to ensure the smooth running of the hospital and the transfer of the three hospitals to Tallaght?  Will the Minister tell us the terms of reference given to Deloitte &amp; Touche, which commenced its studies in the hospital last Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  In February 1998 the hospital submitted a budget which was only £900,000 in excess of its termination budget of £53.7 million.  The <Col N="1504" /> hospital was instructed to resubmit its plan within budget.  It is vital to note that this original plan gave no indication whatever of severe funding shortfalls.</P>
      <P>In regard to the terms of reference, the review will be carried out in the context of the recent merger of the base hospitals and the move to the new hospital at Tallaght and in view of the hospitals' projected major deficit and the current financial difficulties of the Adelaide and Meath hospitals, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital.  The terms will be: first, to review the processes, systems and practices for top general management, reporting and control &mdash; for example, strategic planning process, performance measurement process, accountability process, that is, planning, budgeting, measuring, reporting and analysing &mdash; management information and supporting information systems; second, to review arrangements within the organisation for the development and determination of service plans and associated staffing and financial budgets; third, to review the data submitted and prepared under the agenda dated 1 September 1998; fourth, these reviews will require discussions with the top general management of the hospital and a review of all relevant information; fifth, the Department and the board have agreed to this review &mdash; in this context, a small facilitation group made up of selected officers of the board and officers of the Department will facilitate the review; and sixth, the study group will report to the Minister for Health and Children within a period of three weeks and will advise on appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do those terms of reference not apparently direct Deloitte &amp; Touche to consider the appropriateness of the funding allocation by the Minister's Department to the hospital for its first year of opening and the capacity of the hospital to operate at that funding level?  Will the Minister confirm that he does not propose to take steps which could in any way undermine the voluntary nature of this hospital or its charter?  Will he give an assurance to the House that neither he nor any political source close to him, as quoted in last week's <i>The Sunday Times</i>, will make any more public foolish comments that could undermine either public confidence in the hospital or those working in and administering it?</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce new regulations in relation to health warnings on tobacco products; his views on health warnings on all cigarette packets which state the product to be addictive; and the plans, if any, he has to classify nicotine in cigarettes as a drug.</Quest>

      <P>I am currently conducting a review on smoking and health policy.  I set up a group to advise and report to me.  One of the areas being looked at is health warnings on tobacco product packaging.  When the group reports to me I hope to be in a position to announce a number of initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that, under current tobacco legislation, tobacco companies are required to display tar and nicotine levels on cigarette packets.</P>
      <P>With regard to the classification of nicotine, it is already classified here under the Poisons Regulations as a toxic substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the health warnings currently exhibited on tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, do not tell the full story?  Will he urgently consider putting in place legislation requiring all tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, and advertisements to display very prominently that the products are addictive and that they are a drug?  Will the Minister consider, bearing in mind the classification currently referred to him, that there should be a reference to the fact that they are a toxic substance, which is not at present advertised on tobacco packs?</P>
      <P>When will the Minister's Department play a more active role in discouraging young people from becoming hooked on tobacco?  What is it doing to offset the huge financial advantage in the advertising and promotions area which tobacco companies still have within the market generally, despite advertising controls, and which encourages young people to take up cigarettes and become addicted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy to some extent, in that if one were to tell the whole story of the deleterious effects of smoking on cigarette packets we would need very big packets.  Clearly, any public health warning message will never give <Col N="1506" /> the full story.  However, the warning currently on cigarette packets makes it very clear that it is a very dangerous substance in terms of one's personal health.</P>
      <P>The advisory group which I have set up to report on smoking and health policy is, among other matters, looking at the question of health warnings on tobacco products.  Some countries are introducing a warning on cigarette packets advising of the addictive nature of the product. That option can be examined as soon as the advisory group makes its report.  The Deputy has his views on the proactive nature of my work, but I must await the report of the advisory group. When that group returns to me with specific proposals I will be prepared to go ahead with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of private health insurance in this country is regulated by the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the Health Insurance Regulations, 1996.  The legislation provides for &ldquo;open enrolment&rdquo; which obliges insurers to make cover available to persons under the age of 65, regardless of whether they were previously covered; &ldquo;community rating&rdquo; which requires that insurers must charge the same premium for a given level of cover, regardless of a person's age, sex or health status; and &ldquo;lifetime cover&rdquo; which provides that cover made available cannot be cancelled by the <Col N="1507" /> insurer, except in limited exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The position regarding first time private health insurance cover in the State for over 65 year olds, as set down under the legislation, mirrored the circumstances obtaining in the market prior to the enactment of the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>In particular, the present framework reflects the fact that our system is based on community rating.  As there is a correlation between age and the utilisation of hospital services, a community rated system cannot work effectively if individuals wait until they get to an age where they know they are more likely to avail of the benefits provided under health insurance cover before deciding to contribute to the system.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for registered insurers to decide whether to provide cover for a person of or over the age of 65 years who is seeking access to our community-rated private health insurance system for the first time.  Insurers are not prevented from offering cover to persons aged 65 or over. However, if an insurer decides to make available such cover it must do so on the basis of community rating and lifetime cover.  It may be that this is regarded by insurers as a disincentive to giving cover in such cases.</P>
    <P>My Department is exploring all the options relating to our current regulatory framework in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on private health insurance and the specific issue of first time private insurance cover for persons over the age of 65 will be fully considered in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of increased life expectancy, does the Minister agree that the age of 65 is too low a cut-off point for the insurance companies to operate?  Does he accept it is unreasonable and unfair to young insured people to operate a community rating system for those over age 65 who seek health insurance for the first time, but that there is a need within the health insurance context to provide a mechanism that will give an opening to people over 65 who seek health insurance to obtain it at an appropriate rate, in so far as they would need to pay it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if there were an obligation to give automatic cover to people over 65, the VHI would find it difficult to proceed because people would delay entering the scheme until illness became apparent or more foreseeable.  Submissions have been made on the White Paper and we have received inquiries about, for instance, people returning to Ireland on retirement and seeking access to private health insurance, or cases where improved economic circumstances allow a son or daughter to purchase health insurance for a parent then aged over 65.  I would like the White Paper to examine what could be done in those and similar cases; <Col N="1508" /> these are not incentives to defer membership but instances which are becoming more prevalent in present economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation I would like to inform the House that infant mortality relates to deaths in the first year of life.  The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths in the first year of life per 1,000 live births.  Peri-natal mortality relates to late foetal death and death in the early neo-natal stage.  The early neo-natal stage refers to the first week of life.</P>
      <P>The principal causes of infant mortality include prematurity, low birth weight, infections, congenital abnormalities i.e. defects present at birth and sudden infant death syndrome or cot death.  Infant mortality is affected by complex and multiple factors.  It is recognised internationally that one of the major determinants of infant mortality is social and economic circumstances.  Peri-natal deaths are, in the main, due to prematurity and also to congenital abnormalities and infections.  The number of peri-natal deaths in Tralee General Hospital for the year 1994 to date in 1998 is:</P>

    <P>The figures for infant mortality for the Southern Health Board areas of Cork County Borough, County Cork and County Kerry have been examined by the SHB going back to 1987.  From this examination the Cork city area appears to have higher infant mortality rates than County Cork or County Kerry.  However, in 1997 the infant mortality rate for Cork city had dropped to 4.6 per 1,000 which is below the national average of 6.2 per 1,000.  The Cork city area also has higher levels of low birth weight babies &mdash; a risk factor in itself for infant mortality.</P>
    <P>While well developed health services are important, of even greater significance is to address the associated social and economic factors such as poverty, nutrition and smoking all of which contribute to poorer health status and consequently higher infant mortality.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has examined the trends in infant mortality rates and are currently re-investigating the deaths in greater detail.  In particular, the board is examining the cause of each infant death.  The figures produced in the recently published <i>Central Statistics Office Report on Vital Statistics (1994)</i> relate to county and city borough areas.  The health board is currently endeavouring to break down the deaths on a small area basis.  It is also undertaking a study of the factors which influence the peri-natal death rate in its area and is examining the causes of peri-natal deaths in each hospital since 1988.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern that the level of peri-natal deaths in Kerry, in the context of births in Tralee General Hospital, was almost double the national average for some years for which statistics are available?  Can he confirm that is the position and will he indicate what steps his Department intends taking to look into the reason for this and to ensure any steps which are required in the health area will be taken to address this problem?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, the health board is pro-actively investigating all these deaths on an individual basis and working on a smaller area matrix to determine what issues are involved.  There are a number of issues and it is not primarily down to health facilities, it concerns the health status of mothers and foetuses in peri-natal deaths and that of young infants in infant deaths.  It is being taken seriously by the Southern Health Board and an investigation is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there is no reason the position as regards births in Kerry should be different to that in any other part of the country?  Will he confirm that, if additional facilities or consultants are required in Tralee General Hospital, he will make the necessary financial allocations available and give the necessary sanctions?  Is he asking the health board to report back to him on this issue and on the high level of infant mortality in the Cork city area which, for reasons which are not understood at present, substantially exceeded the national average until 1997?</P>

      <P>Registration of birth may have taken place where a baby was born and that could distort the figures as regards the residence of the mother.  One would have to go into the statistics in greater detail but on the face of it this would justify a pro-active inquiry and that is ongoing. Issues like that may be distorting factors and could explain the position, rather than other factors being involved.  We will have to get to the bottom of that.  There is no suggestion in the information available to me from the Southern Health Board that an inadequacy of facility or expertise at the time of birth is the cause of this problem &mdash; wider public health issues may be involved, as well as where the registration took place and the catchment areas for the birth mother in relation to each hospital, which could be outside the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that there is substantial concern about this in Cork and that it is of great importance that the results of the inquiry being conducted by the Southern Health Board are not only made available to him but are published?  Will he confirm that they will be published, that the urgent need for new maternity services in Cork is being and will be met and that any other action necessary <Col N="1512" /> will be taken on foot of the results of the investigation now taking place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the report becomes available, the public should know the reasons.  There is no problem with that.  The reasons for the trends upwards and downwards in the Southern Health Board area are being investigated by the board. As regards infant mortality, the board has gone back to 1987 in its exercise and is trying to break down the deaths to the smallest possible area to enable it to establish the specific cause of death in each case.</P>
      <P>In this context, about 50 per cent of the deaths are due to prematurity.  The board is attempting to identify the deaths associated with the various complex causes and factors, such as social and economic circumstances, as well as the normal ill-health factors.  Towards this end, the small area research unit in Trinity College, Dublin, has developed a deprivation index and the Southern Health Board will use it to try to establish if there is a link between social and economic circumstances and infant mortality rates.</P>
      <P>In relation to peri-natal mortality, the board is also undertaking a study of all the factors which influence the peri-natal death rate and is examining each peri-natal death going back to 1988 to find its cause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 46 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will first make a general statement regarding the measures I am taking to ensure that, where Ireland is concerned, inter-country adoption procedures conform to the highest possible standards. It is internationally recognised that it is by concluding bilateral and multilateral arrangements between states of origin and receiving states that the most effective measures to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place only if they are in the best interests of the children concerned <Col N="1513" /> can be put in place.  The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, 1993, provides a means of achieving this.  The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safe-guards to prevent the abduction or sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  It strives to achieve these objectives by dividing responsibilities with regard to the processing of inter-country adoption between the sending and receiving states by establishing general central authorities to oversee inter-country adoptions in each contracting state and by providing for the accreditation of agencies involved in inter-country adoption.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the importance of bringing the convention into effect in Ireland and I have made the drafting of legislation to enable ratification of the convention a priority.  Specific staff in the newly established child care legislation unit have been assigned to the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws.  At present, our inter-country adoption laws deal mainly with the approval of suitable prospective adopters and the recognition of foreign adoptions.  Among the items which the convention Bill will have to make provision for are: the designation of a central authority with overall responsibility for inter-country adoption; the accreditation of competent bodies such as adoption agencies to undertake certain tasks in relation to arrangements for the inter-country adoption of children and automatic recognition of adoptions made under the convention.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I intend to take a wide ranging approach to the Bill to use this legislative opportunity to tackle a number of issues which have arisen in inter-country adoption since the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991.  Today and in questions tabled last Tuesday, the Deputy raised some of these issues.  Further issues have been identified in the Law Reform Commission's report on the convention.  I would like to make it clear to the House that all aspects of our inter-country adoption law are being reviewed in the context of the Hague Convention Bill and this review will also incorporate procedures for adoption from non-convention countries.</P>
    <P>The ratification of the convention is a priority and consideration of all the relevant issues together will facilitate an integrated and coherent approach to inter-country adoption and one which conforms to the highest possible standards. There are difficulties in trying to deal with specific issues outside of the Hague Convention Bill as the overall structure of our foreign adoption law is based mainly on the recognition of the adoption laws of other states and does not give a direct role to the Adoption Board in the processing of individual adoption applications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> On the issues raised by the Deputy prospective adopters use the services of foreign adoption agencies as there is no state to state channel for processing applications for adoption with the exception of adoptions from China, Romania and Belarus.  The organisations used by prospective adopters range from large American agencies to individual lawyers in the child's state of origin.  It is important to bear in mind that the majority of these organisations maintain no presence in this country and that prospective adopters contact them by means such as the Internet, word of mouth and contacts in the child's state of origin. I have concerns about prospective Irish adopters seeking the assistance of adoption agencies, facilitators, mediators, etc., who are unregulated in this country, as the practice contains potential for abuse.  I have made these concerns clear on previous occasions.  Speaking on this issue in the Seanad on 13 March last and in the Dáil on a number of occasions, I stressed the need for prospective adopters to seek the best available advice prior to embarking on the adoption process and recommended that they contact the adoption agency or one of the support groups for adoptive parents to inform themselves on the reality of the adoption process.</P>
    <P>The possibility of foreign adoption organisations taking advantage of childless couples wishing to adopt abroad was made clear from last night's RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary.  An even more sinister possibility is that of mediators involving themselves in child trafficking under cover of inter-country adoption.  I emphasise, however, that under our present adoption laws, the Adoption Board has no role in the process by which a person or persons who have been declared eligible and suitable by the board to effect a foreign adoption goes on to effect such an adoption: this procedure being conducted in accordance with the law of the state of origin.  As regards foreign adoption agencies which choose to maintain a presence in this country, I understand that the Adoption Board has sought legal advice as to whether their activities are in contravention of certain aspects of the Adoption Act, 1952.  I urge prospective adopters not to engage the services of foreign adoption agencies without first consulting the Adoption Board or one of the support groups for adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>There would be considerable difficulties in trying to deal with this issue prior to the introduction of the Hague Convention Bill.  To be effective, any legislation would have to provide for the regulation of agencies which offer their services outside of Ireland as well as those which offer their services to prospective adopters inside the country.  The Adoption Board would have great difficulty in policing such a system under our present foreign adoption laws which operate mainly on the basis of the recognition of foreign adoptions and where the board does not have a direct role in the processing of individual adoption applications.  I consider that measures to regulate inter-country adoption agencies could be <Col N="1515" /> much more feasibly introduced under the Hague Convention Bill and I will address it in that context. The convention Bill will establish the necessary supporting apparatus to tackle the issue, that is, a central authority with wide powers to oversee the inter-country adoption process and direct state to state co-operation in the processing of individual adoption applications.</P>
    <P>As regards compulsory DNA testing of children and their birth parents, there would be great difficulty in introducing such a system under our present legislation which operates on the basis of the recognition of foreign adoption laws including the manner in which consents to adoption are obtained under those laws.  I see a further difficulty in introducing such a system as part of the Hague Convention Bill as Article 4 of the convention imposes the obligation to obtain the necessary consents to the adoption in the state of origin rather than in the receiving state.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the introduction of DNA testing on a general level would be practical or desirable as it could conflict with the law of the state of origin and undermine the co-operation between the central authorities for the successful implementation of inter-country adoption procedures. Co-operation between the central authorities of sending and receiving states and the restriction of mediation in the adoption process of accredited agencies offers a more feasible means of ensuring that child trafficking does not take place under the cover of inter-country adoption.</P>
    <P>Irish residents have adopted from Guatemala under the Adoption Act, 1952, but due to the incompatibility of Irish and Guatemalan law the Adoption Board has appointed an authorised person in that country to ensure the valid consent of the adoption has been obtained.  This person recently carried out DNA tests in two cases where he was not satisfied about the identity of the person claiming to be the natural mother.  The tests showed that the person claiming to be the natural mother was in fact the mother in both cases.</P>
    <P>Ireland signed the Hague Convention on 19 June 1996.  I regard ratification of the convention as a priority.  I secured the appointment of six additional staff for the new child care legislation unit in my Department to process work on this and a number of other Bills.  Work on the legislation has commenced and it is intended to hold the consultative process with the relevant interests shortly.  I am fully aware of the urgency of the Bill and will bring it before the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.  He will agree that foreign adoptions, which are largely unregulated, can be abused by unscrupulous persons as was seen on Prime Time last night.  Horrific cases were described where vulnerable parents were completely let down and many fraudulent practices <Col N="1516" /> were in evidence.  The Taoiseach indicated it would be the middle of 1999 before the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention would be ready. Will the Minister of State consider introducing the legislation sooner?  This is a matter of great urgency given that it appears to be impossible to regulate those who abuse the system.  I urge him to bring this legislation forward given that there is extra staff in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the legislation will be brought forward in the shortest possible timescale.  However, it is complex legislation and involves a wide range of legislative proposals.  I am using the legislation to incorporate other aspects of foreign adoptions and I must be realistic, as the Taoiseach has been, with the House.  We must undertake a consultative process, prepare the heads of the Bill and then draft it.  The legislation and contacts on it are the highest priority of the new unit.  Every effort will be made to bring the legislation before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The 1991 legislation was introduced in a hurry to deal with the Romanian situation that pertained at the time.  Nobody recognised then that such developments in, and problems with, inter-country adoptions would occur.  I have taken every opportunity in both Houses and through press statements to warn people about a number of operators that carry out mediation, etc.  regarding adoptions.  People should not deal with any agency without going through the Adoption Board.  They leave themselves in a vulnerable position if they do so.</P>
      <P>We have concluded agreements with Belarus, Romania and China over the past 12 months and there are ample opportunities to adopt children from those countries, especially Romania.  We ask people to use recognised agencies and the Adoption Board because, otherwise, they are liable to face the difficulties seen in last night's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the Minister of State has got a great deal of mileage out of his involvement in the adoption issue since he took up office, will he accept that his answer is a disappointment?  It will take until mid-1999 at the earliest to prepare this complex legislation.  It will then be debated and follow the normal process after which the process of setting up structures will begin.  Does the Minister recognise that the length of time involved will be much longer than six to nine months and that in the meantime people in a vulnerable position can be exploited?  Will he consider isolating legislation to deal with this?  The legislation the Minister has in mind is more wide-ranging than simply dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will he consider a state to state arrangement with Russia?  It appears that 12 families have already adopted Russian children.  Will he consider embarking on a route whereby such adoptions would be legitimised?  I am surprised that <Col N="1517" /> the Adoption Board is the body taking legal advice.  Does the Attorney-General have a role?  Will the Minister of State seek his advice given that he is extremely expert regarding possible breaches of the Adoption Act, 1991, and other measures?</P>
    <P>Democratic Left will introduce a Bill during this session, without any great preparation, to deal with the trafficking of asylum seekers and criminalise employers who might take them on. The adoption issue concerns babies and potential parents who are vulnerable, yet the Minister of State is asking them to wait years to deal with this outrageous situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy displays an inordinate lack of understanding about this problem in suggesting that there is a way of separating this issue. The only way to deal with this problem is through ratification of the Hague Convention because it ties in all the other countries.  I resent the Deputy's statement that I am getting mileage out of this issue.  One of the first problems I was presented with when I took up office was that Ireland did not have an agreement with any country regarding adoptions and a free for all was in place.  People were trying to adopt for years from Romania and China.  The first requirement was that there would be inter-country agreements between ourselves and the Romanians and Chinese. I set out to do that and it has been successful.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion regarding Russia is a possibility and we are looking at it.  Russia is not a signatory to the UN convention and that may cause a problem.  With regard to legal advice, the Adoption Board must give licences to adoption societies and, consequently, the board is the State's regulatory arm in this sector.  We are trying to see if there is any way under the 1952 legislation to prohibit the operation of agencies such as those seen on last night's television programme. The best form of prohibition is for people to understand that they should not deal with agencies which are not recommended by the Adoption Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that while we await the legislation, operators such as Brendan Moloney, who was highlighted in last night's programme, will remain unregulated.  Will the Minister confirm if there is any way in which agencies operating outside the country can be regulated in the meantime?  Those agencies may be allowed to continue operating without any regulation until the necessary legislation is implemented.  The report of the Law Reform Commission outlines comparative measures in countries such as Britain and France which have ratified the convention. It might be possible to speed up the introduction of the legislation by examining the measures used in those neighbouring counties. We cannot afford to wait until the necessary legislation is introduced to regulate this type of operation, <Col N="1518" /> particularly in view of what we saw on television last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The time involved will be much shorter than the time it normally takes to introduce legislation.  We are talking about a matter of months.  Members who have been involved in the preparation of legislation will know it takes a number of months for the parliamentary draftsman to prepare legislation.  I do not want to give a promise here on which I cannot deliver.  We will move as quickly as we can on this.  In the meantime we cannot regulate those agencies because the 1991 legislation gave recognition only to adoptions from Romania.  It was limited legislation which was rushed through the House.  It was introduced by Deputy Shatter and was substantially rewritten.  There is not an easy solution to this.  We have to introduce new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the 1991 Act applies generally to the recognition of adoptions and does not specifically mention Romania or anywhere else?  He might confirm that in so far as it was rewritten, most of the problems that derived from that legislation derive from the rewriting undertaken by his colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon who was then Minister for Health.  Will he clarify if the adoption legislation will be given priority in the context of legislative drafting over the previously promised prioritised legislation to provide a social services inspectorate, which seems to have dropped from sight?  It would be of help to the House to know which legislation will be published first?</P>

The Minister of State told this House in or about this time last year that he was prioritising the legislation on a social services inspectorate.  Why should we believe him when he tells us that he is prioritising this legislation?  Will he confirm whether he is saying he might publish a Bill on this some time in the middle of the next summer?  Will we see it next autumn or, in view of how he has forgotten what he said about a social services inspectorate, will he tell us when Second Stage debate of the proposed adoption legislation will be taken?</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Shatter want to hear the facts?  An additional 17 members of staff have been recruited in the child care section of the Department of Health and Children.  The staff has increased from ten to 27.  Ten staff were expected to wave the magic wand that Deputy Shatter has waved since he got into that seat 12 months ago and which he is waving again today.

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that his performance in the House to date confirms that he does not have the capacity to do as he stated?  In the context of the national strategy, will the Minister of State identify the page in the <Col N="1522" /> Government's published programme of proposed legislation on which the Bill to provide a statutory basis for the social services inspectorate appears?  On what page does it appear in the programme circulated by the Government Whip?</P>

      <P>I find the questions on the social services inspectorate amusing.  During the number of years when Deputy Shatter's party was in Government it made promises about the inspectorate, but it did not provide the resources, staff or planning for it.  It promised it but did nothing about it.  Since then I have provided the resources and staff and we have advertised the posts.  Interviews are being held at present.  The money is available and the social services inspectorate will be up and running shortly.  I do not know what more the Deputy wants.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, when Deputy Currie occupied his position steps were taken towards providing legislation for a social services inspectorate.  I ask the Minister of State to come clean with the House and to acknowledge that it is no longer part of Government policy to provide a statutory basis for a social services inspectorate.  Will he further acknowledge that the reason for dropping that plan is to ensure there is not an inspectorate which might be critical of the Minister of State or his Department in relation to children's issues?  The Minister of State wants an inspectorate with an administrative base so that, effectively, whatever it examines will be controlled by him and his Department.</P>

      <P>The commitment still stands.  I took over a child care section with ten staff.

My first task was to set up a new legislative unit to examine several important Bills.  It was necessary to secure staff for the unit and the total has been increased from ten to 27.  This is a significant increase in addition to the six staff in the social services inspectorate.  The unit is dealing with two major Bills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that after almost 18 months in Government, he is damaging his credibility by still blaming the Opposition?  It is time he stood on his record.  I commend the Minister of State for accepting that he has responsibility to produce the strategy for children.  When this issue was debated previously he did not accept that responsibility.  If we are confused it is because the Minister of State is saying that, on the one hand, he will do something that he said previously he would not do and, on the other, he will not do something he promised to do previously.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State gave a short reply on the strategy.  He has not given any detail as to how he intends to approach the formulation of an integrated strategy.  If it is to be serious, will he accept there is a requirement on him not only to deal with legal draftsmen but to create units in his Department and the other relevant Departments which are dedicated to drawing up a strategy which will deal with the current shambles in relation to child care in areas including accommodation, hospital waiting lists and secure units?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that it requires management to produce a meaningful strategy that will bring about progress in an area which everybody recognises is in chaos?  A good management approach from the top is required. The Minister of State is late in reaching this matter and the Government was foolish in terms of how it defined his role in the first place, but he is now stumbling towards an approach to a strategy. What is the Minister of State's approach to a strategy on children because his reply did not outline how he will tackle the major issue in his brief?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the Government on the allegations in <i>Magill</i> today that the Revenue Commissioners turned a blind eye to tax fraud in relation to DIRT and bogus non-resident accounts.  The content of this story is not new. The Minister for Finance gave a detailed reply to a question on this case from Deputy Rabbitte on 28 April.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1986 the DIRT system has collected £2.5 billion for the State.  It is an important mechanism for revenue collection and it is important that it operates correctly.  Financial institutions are required to deduct tax at source from deposit interest earned by individuals tax resident in Ireland.  The normal rate of deduction is the standard income tax rate but a lower rate applies in the case of special savings accounts.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1986 deposit interest was paid gross in the case of banks &mdash; building societies had special arrangements &mdash; which were required to notify the Revenue Commissioners where the interest in an account exceeded £50.  From 1986 banks and building societies were treated in the same way, deducting tax from the interest paid to residents, and the obligation to notify the Revenue Commissioners of deposit interest was done away with.</P>
      <P>DIRT does not apply where the account holder is non-resident and makes a formal declaration to that effect to the financial institution.  The law requires that the declaration should contain, <i>inter alia</i>, the name, address and country of tax residence of the person entitled to the deposit interest.  The financial institution has a duty under the legislation to satisfy itself that a deposit is not exempt from DIRT before it pays interest gross.</P>
      <P>The <i>Magill</i> report that there was a sizeable number of bogus accounts in one or more of the main banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s gives rise to considerable and justifiable concerns.  As the Minister pointed out in April, the Government shares these concerns.  It is against tax evasion and is determined to ensure it is dealt with as firmly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pursuit of tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who must deal with these on a confidential basis.  On various occasions the Revenue Commissioners have discovered individual cases where false non-residence declarations had been made by individuals for the purpose of evading tax on deposit interest.  In all these cases the Revenue Commissioners advise me that they took action as regards the taxpayers involved by recovering any underpaid tax and interest and penalties, as appropriate.  The Revenue Commissioners also raised the matter generally with certain institutions concerned in the early 1990s and I am advised were given assurances that steps had been taken to ensure compliance with the legislative requirements.  The Central Bank was aware of the matter at the time and of the steps <Col N="1528" /> being taken, including those of the Revenue Commissioners, to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>Before the initial media reports of historic non-compliance in this area earlier this year the Revenue Commissioners had commenced a review of the position generally.  Their work includes an examination of ongoing controls, procedures and liabilities and, where considered necessary, involves an examination of liabilities in past years.  The review covers all financial institutions and is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are reported in the <i>Magill</i> article as confirming that the alleged irregularities are being investigated and that they will take all appropriate action.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners reiterated this on radio today.  He indicated that the new information which became available in April and in the <i>Magill</i> article is being taken on board in these investigations and that the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to reopen tax liability for earlier years, as required, in the light of new information.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of tax collection is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who act independently in such issues.  The Government does not and has not got involved in the Revenue Commissioners' action in this matter.  The role of the Minister is to ensure the Revenue Commissioners have the resources to act in these matters and the necessary powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked the Revenue Commissioners and his Department to look at whether new powers are needed for the Revenue Commissioners in tackling tax evasion.  This review is wide-ranging and includes the question of the extent of the Revenue Commissioners' access to bank accounts.  As is the case in other countries, the Revenue Commissioners do not have unfettered access to bank accounts.  This question raises the issue of where the balance should be struck.</P>
    <P>The powers available to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to tax evasion were last added to significantly in 1992.  These new powers included provision of third party returns to the Revenue Commissioners on an automatic basis; reporting by domestic institutions which act as intermediaries in the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents; provision of information on dealings by related parties such as suppliers; extended inspection powers in relation to certain tax records and accounts, and attachment of amounts owed by third parties to a defaulting taxpayer.  These were added to further in 1993 and 1995 when reporting arrangements and other duties were imposed on certain company advisers.  The outcome of the latest review of the Revenue Commissioners' powers will be examined in light of the report of the Moriarty tribunal so that whatever measures are considered necessary in this area can be taken.</P>
    <P>On the question of bank regulation, in response to public concerns raised in connection with allegations about certain activities of particular <Col N="1529" /> banks, the Minister for Finance established a working group with a mandate to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  During the working group's deliberations, which are ongoing, the question of a single regulator for the financial services sector emerged.  This issue is under examination.  This involves consideration of such issues as status, structure and functions.  It is anticipated that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance will jointly submit a memorandum on the subject for consideration by the Government in the near future. At that stage the Government will decide how to take this matter forward.  The issue of legislation will only be decided upon when the Government has made a substantive decision regarding the proposal to establish a single regulator.</P>

      <P>It is scandalous that Allied Irish Bank made a deal with the Revenue Commissioners in 1991 to write off a tax liability of approximately £86 million owed to the State for DIRT.  There is strong documentary evidence that this deal was done on the basis that there would be no publicity and no prosecutions for tax evasion and that once the deal was done a line would be drawn under any tax liabilities up to that time owed by Allied Irish Bank on non-resident accounts.  What makes this even more scandalous is that the deal was done with a financial institution which consistently announces enormous annual profits and which could well afford to pay the taxes due.  The fury and frustration of PAYE taxpayers when they hear about golden deals done for the golden circles by the Revenue Commissioners is understandable.</P>
      <P>There are a number of questions which must be answered by the Government, the Revenue Commissioners and Allied Irish Banks.  I demand that the Government find the answers to the questions raised here today and those already raised in the <i>Magill</i> article and elsewhere.  It is interesting to note that the current Government, made up of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, is the same coalition that was in power in 1991 when this major tax evasion write-off was agreed.  It will not be good enough for the Government to wash their hands of this scandal by indicating it is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners, who are independent, and for Allied Irish Banks.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, was Minister for Finance for some of this time in 1991 and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was a Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put the following questions although I know the time available later for asking questions will be short and I probably will not get answers to all of them.  Will the Government give a full and frank explanation of all the circumstances surrounding the deal done between the Revenue Commissioners and Allied Irish Banks?  What steps are being taken to recoup the money written off in 1991?  Will the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1530" /> be in a position to re-examine the deal done and charge Allied Irish Banks for the taxes due of approximately £86 million?  Was the deal done with Allied Irish Banks the only deal done at that time or were other financial institutions favoured with these special write-off facilities?  By what authority did the senior inspector of the Revenue Commissioners offer the deal to AIB in 1991, and why did the Revenue Commissioners not use the powers available to them under section 37 of the 1986 Finance Act to examine the declarations of non-resident status account holders?  Have the Revenue Commissioners identified any further liabilities for DIRT since the deal was struck in 1991?  How many illegal non-resident accounts have been identified?  Have any prosecutions been taken against any personnel in AIB or any other financial institutions for non-compliance with the Finance Act, 1986, which required and obliged the financial institutions to return DIRT to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of those holding interest accruing accounts?  What political consultation, if any, took place with the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach in 1991 about this major write-off of tax due to the State?  Was the Government of the day informed, particularly in any pre-budgetary discussions, about the extent of DIRT being collected and the extent of DIRT being foregone as a result of the illegal use of non-residential accounts?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the information now in the public arena that serious tax evasion was taking place in at least one financial institution but more than likely in a number of financial institutions almost from the beginning of the collection of DIRT in 1987.  DIRT was introduced in 1986 by the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  The Government changed in early 1987 and it appears from all evidence that once DIRT became a liability for people with savings accounts, the bank and other financial institutions discussed with their clients ways in which taxes could be avoided.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance is not a crime but tax evasion is and it is now clear that financial institutions were offering to clients the opportunity to move their money off-shore for the purposes of evading taxes.  It appears that a client with money who did not wish to pay taxes was offered an opportunity to open an account overseas using an accommodation address.  We know from the <i>Magill</i> article that in 1991, following a request from the Revenue Commissioners, AIB conducted an investigation into its own non-resident accounts and found that out of a total of 87,660 non-resident accounts containing almost £1 billion, approximately 60 per cent, or 53,000 accounts, were bogus.  Clearly AIB was breaking the law in having 53,000 bogus accounts in their banks because before opening a non-resident account a special form had to be completed registering the customer's declaration of non-resident status.  In 1991, AIB's investigation showed that 17,000 of the 53,000 accounts did not even have such a declaration and that the declaration in regard to the <Col N="1531" /> remainder of those accounts was equally fraudulent.</P>
    <P>The ordinary PAYE taxpayer and indeed many self employed taxpayers know only too well how diligent and persistent the tax authorities can be if they do not send in their VAT returns on time or if they have not fully complied with their tax liability.  Threatening letters will arrive on their doorsteps.  This morning one PAYE taxpayer received a letter demanding the immediate payment of a small liability of £250 immediately with the dire threat of action being taken if it was not paid.  How can the taxpayer have faith in a system when such small liabilities are followed up with vigour while the bigger and more profitable companies, such as AIB in this instance, can work out cosy deals.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners and all other institutions publish annual reports.  Why was the Revenue Commissioners' annual report of 1991 so coy in its chapter heading &ldquo;Deterring Evasion&rdquo; when it knew it was already in correspondence with AIB about a serious breach of the 1986 Finance Act?  Why in its annual report did it not refer to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners were in the process of writing off £86 million worth of tax on the basis of a nod, a wink and silence?  At the same time in 1991, the Revenue Commissioners were indicating to AIB that detection of offences arising after June 1991 would give rise to prosecution.  How can the Revenue Commissioners have this <i>a la carte</i> system of deciding on tax liabilities and who will be punished?  Why did the 1991 AIB report not refer to the settlement being worked out with the Revenue Commissioners?  Why was there not a reference to a letter from Jimmy O'Mahony, Group Taxation Manager, to Anthony Spollan, Group Internal Auditor, on 28 February 1991, which stated &ldquo;we are being offered a way out of a very difficult situation which I believe will meet the needs of both the Revenue and the other financial institutions without it being publicised &mdash; this being very much in the interest of the bank&rdquo;. What about the ordinary taxpayer?</P>
    <P>What is the point of launching annual reports at glossy PR occasions announcing profits if those reports hide what really is going on?  The role of the Central Bank is central in the way our financial institutions operate and it is now clear that the Central Bank does not have the powers or is not a suitable vehicle for controlling and ensuring the legal operation of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>In March this year, the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Michael Noonan, proposed the setting up of an independent banking inspectorate. He brought that proposal to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  In July of this year that committee concluded that current legislation and regulations are inadequate to supervise the commercial banking sector effectively and recommended the establishment of an independent financial services authority which would have the effect of restoring public confidence <Col N="1532" /> and guarantee that financial institutions would be properly and comprehensively supervised.</P>
    <P>Today on the Order of Business, the Tánaiste told us that she and the Minister for Finance were examining a proposal.  In view of the fact that the credibility of our financial institutions is central to the way we do our business and attract investment to the country, it is not sufficient for the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance to continue to have discussions about this matter.  I want a commitment from the Government that an independent financial services authority will be set up as a matter of urgency.  Fine Gael will co-operate in whatever procedures are required to take such legislation through this House as we proposed in March of this year.</P>
    <P>The tax evasion that occurred in 1991, on the scale of at least £86 million, could not have come about without the connivance of a number of people and institutions &mdash; individual account holders who lied about their non-resident status; Allied Irish Banks which allowed people who were not non-resident to open non-resident accounts and then knowingly did a deal with the Revenue Commissioners to avoid paying tax; the Revenue Commissioners who worked out a deal whereby taxpayers in general would be at a loss of many millions of pounds of due tax; the Central Bank which was aware of the possibility of abuse of non-resident accounts and did not take the necessary action to prevent this happening in the financial institutions; and the acquiescence of the Government in 1991-2 which was either unaware of the abuse of non-resident account systems or was aware and did nothing about it thereby allowing the loss of tax revenue to the country.</P>
    <P>This is a bad day for the ordinary taxpayers who have worked hard and paid their taxes to make this country as successful as it is now.  The Government owes it to compliant taxpayers to make all the information about this situation known, to ensure that taxes due are collected and to take prosecutions if people have behaved illegally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's revelations confirm what we have known for some time, that the firmament of Irish banking in the 1980s and early 1990s was rotten to the core.  Some months ago we learned that one of the associated banks was ripping off its customers.  Now we find out that at least one other associated bank was ripping off the Revenue Commissioners as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two questions at the core of this matter. Did Allied Irish Banks make full disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners before the so-called settlement was reached in 1991?  If not, the settlement cannot be allowed to stand and must be revisited by the Revenue Commissioners.  If, on the other hand, the bank disclosed the facts to the Revenue Commissioners then we are entitled to hear from the Revenue Commissioners why such an incredibly lenient settlement was reached. <Col N="1533" /> What is most shocking about these revelations is the sheer scale of the abuse.  The <i>Magill</i> article asserts that in 1991 AIB harboured some 87,000 non-resident accounts, of which at least 53,000 were bogus.  It is alleged that these bogus accounts contained some £600 million.  <i>Magill</i> contains extracts from alleged internal memos and extracts from a report of the internal audit department of the bank.  We need to know if this documentation is accurate, and we are entitled to be told by the bank whether the extracts set out in <i>Magill</i> reflect the true position.</P>
    <P>What struck me most about those extracts, if one accepts that they are accurate, was the cosiness of their tone.  All Members know small businessmen who have been subjected to Revenue audits.  Those businessmen are quaking for weeks before those audits and sometimes for weeks, months or even years afterwards.  There is no sense of that from this correspondence; there is no sense of people quaking in their boots or fearing for their jobs.  They seem to be relaxed in the knowledge that they will be accommodated.</P>
    <P>If the extracts are true then the implications are very serious because the information confirms beyond any reasonable doubt that individual officers and managers of AIB, if not the system, were engaged in systematically ripping off the Revenue Commissioners.  In a sense we already knew.  We also knew that this practice was widespread throughout the bank network and that it continued for a period of at least five years. However, we need to know more and we must insist on being told more.  We need to know that the chapter is closed and we need to know just how it was closed.  A full account must be given for that period.</P>
    <P>Tax settlements and tax amnesties are nothing new, but the conditions are crystal clear.  The person or company looking to make the settlement must make all the facts known to the Revenue Commissioners.  If they are looking for mercy then they must come out with their hands up.  To borrow a religious metaphor, if you look for absolution then you must make full contrition.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners made it clear on radio today that the Revenue Commissioners were investigating new information which had come to their attention.  The implications of this statement are unambiguous. If the Revenue Commissioners were not given the full facts then the so called settlement was based on misinformation, very likely on fraud, and cannot be allowed to stand.  If that is so then the Revenue Commissioners must apply the full rigour of the law to putting the matter to right. This means that arrears and penalties must be pursued and that those who withheld information, if information was withheld, must be called to account.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understate the anger of PAYE workers and ordinary taxpayers when stories such as this come to light.  PAYE taxpayers have each and every penny of chargeable tax deducted at source.  Small businesses are frequently hounded <Col N="1534" /> for relatively small amounts of money, as Deputy Owen said.  Yet Allied Irish Banks plc, one of the most profitable companies in the State, a company which will make close to £1 billion pounds in profits this year is allowed to make a settlement which will save it tens of millions of pounds. This sends out a shocking and unacceptable message. It says quite simply that there is one law for the big guy &mdash; in this case, the very big guy &mdash;&mdash; and one law for the small guy.  It falls to us as the democratically elected representatives of the Irish people to say that this is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Of course we have a responsibility to ensure the stability of the banking system, but we have a greater and more important duty to ensure that law and the rule of law is applied fairly and equitably to all our citizens.  We cannot fail in that duty because if we do we bring the law, and particularly taxation law, into disrepute with all the predictable consequences which flow from that.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time in recent months that issues of this kind have been discussed in the House.  We have had a sequence of controversies relating to bank charges, interest rate loading, money laundering, Irish registered non-resident companies and bogus non-resident bank accounts.  What this says about our banking system is beyond doubt.  The system &mdash; and not just AIB or National Irish Bank &mdash; was thoroughly corrupt.  We need to be brutally honest and say that this could not have happened if a significant number of people were not prepared to use and abuse the system for their own dishonest purposes.</P>
    <P>These revelations also tell us something else. They tell us that the system of control and supervision simply did not work.  In particular they tell us that the Central Bank cannot be asked to perform contradictory functions.  The Central Bank is concerned only with the prudential supervision of the banking system, as its governor has told us many times.  It is not concerned to ensure that banks comply with tax law, much less the interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>We have known all of this for some time.  In April of this year the Minister for Finance asked the banking section of his Department to make proposals as to how the role of the Central Bank could be clarified and as to how the interests of consumers could be safeguarded.  The report was to be submitted within weeks.  We were later told that the report was expected by the end of July. The Taoiseach said me yesterday that he expected to have proposals soon.  It is quite clear that as soon as the glare of publicity was directed elsewhere the question quickly slipped down the Government's list of priorities.</P>
    <P>We all know what has to be done.  An independent financial services authority should be set up without delay.  This authority should have the power to regulate and supervise all the financial institutions in the State, be they banks, building societies, insurance companies, investment intermediaries or anyone else involved in similar business. There is no end of international precedents <Col N="1535" /> for such an authority and the Minister knows that; there is no excuse for further delay.  All Members know what has to be done and the Minister should set about doing it.</P>
    <P>However, a financial services authority is not enough in itself.  There are a whole range of other measures which need to be taken.  Banks should be obliged to furnish the Revenue Commissioners with a list of non-resident accounts and the names in which they are held.  The banks should be obliged to provide a list of special savings accounts and the names in which they are held.  The Revenue Commissioners should be entitled to access to bank accounts if they have good reason to believe that an individual or company is not paying their proper share of tax.  All Irish registered non-resident companies should be required to register with the Revenue Commissioners, even in cases where they are not active in providing goods or services in the State.</P>
    <P>AIB is one of the most profitable Irish companies and it has been for many years.  On the one occasion in recent years when it did run into trouble it was bailed out by the taxpayer.  That makes it all the more shocking that it deliberately connived in ripping off the taxpayer.  It is worth remembering why this was done.  AIB did not assist tax evasion for the sake of it but to gain market share, to make greater profits and because it evidently believed that that needed to be done in order to compete in an increasingly competitive business.</P>
    <P>All Members know that the financial services business will become even more competitive in future years.  If that happens, if there are more players in the market and if the profit margins are reduced as they likely will be, then we must be absolutely sure that the shoddy and illegal practices which have come to light over recent months are a thing of the past.  We must be sure that this sorry chapter is well and truly over and we must give ourselves the means, the institutional structures and the power of law to ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not rehearse the arguments of my colleagues; the information is in <i>Magill.</i> Coming on top of other disclosures it has done serious damage to confidence in the tax collection system.  Why did we have to wait to read it in <i>Magill</i>?  The now retired chairman of the Revenue Commissioners was before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Committee of Public Accounts in recent months and we received none of this information.  It is right that the Revenue Commissioners are independent and that the tax affairs of each citizen are confidential.  However, the Revenue Commissioners cannot use confidentiality as a shield behind which to conceal deficiencies and lapses in the efficacy of the tax collection system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember making statements in the House ten years ago concerning tax evasion on a huge scale in the beef industry.  I was able, on the basis <Col N="1536" /> of documentary evidence, to make these allegations before the beef tribunal.  The largest corporate tax evasion scam in the history of the State was unveiled.  However, when the report of the tribunal was published, the chairman devoted most of the chapter on tax evasion to disputing an allegation I made when I asked if the Revenue Commissioners turned a blind eye.  It was only at the end that he established that there was the largest corporate tax evasion scam in the history of industrial Ireland.</P>
    <P>I did not mean then to imply any dishonesty on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, nor do I now, as I ask the question again.  Was there no benchmark in that case?  How could a company claiming to be one of the largest in the country make tax returns more suitable to a corner shop?  How, in the case of the largest company in the country, can there be tax evasion on this huge scale and the Revenue Commissioners not know about it?  The new chairman, whom I wish well in office, declared today that the tax affairs of any client are confidential.  The Committee of Public Accounts today decided that he should come before it next Tuesday.  If the new chairman of the Revenue Commissioners says he cannot comment on the AIB case because it is confidential, there will be no point in having the meeting.  His predecessor came before the committee after the <i>Irish Independent</i> initially revealed and Charlie Bird and George Lee elaborated on similar incidents in National Irish Bank and we received a similar answer.  This poses the question: <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>&mdash; who will guard the guards?  If we are to have confidence in the efficacy of the tax collection system, the chairman will have to come before the relevant committee on a matter of such huge public interest and explain how it happened.</P>
    <P>No one alleges the Revenue Commissioners were complicit in it, but if AIB had 56,000 bogus non-resident accounts, it is certain that Bank of Ireland matched it bogus account for bogus account.  If the remainder of the commercial banks and financial institutions are included, more than a quarter of the tax paying population was involved in tax evasion practices.  There were 14,251 bogus non-resident clients in Tralee, which amounts to £187 million, and the only people who did not know about it were the Revenue Commissioners. Hundreds of thousands of people were on the streets of towns and villages in the late 1970s and early 1980s because they said they were being brutalised by a penal tax code and that others were not paying their fair share.  They did not know how right they were.  Apparently all one had to do was have a word with the bank manager, give him the name of a cousin in the Bronx and one need not have paid any tax.</P>
    <P>This goes to the heart of confidence in the democratic system.  If people do not pay their taxes in the belief that they are fairly levied and for the equitable running of society, there cannot be a democratic society.  This threatens the basis of the system.  We cannot deal with some of the <Col N="1537" /> questions in this short debate because it does not do justice to a subject of this magnitude.  I agree with a great deal of what the Minister said.  The House will have to return to this matter to consider all aspects of it.</P>

      <P>I asked the Tánaiste this morning whether the Government would now speed up the publication of the Fraud Offences Bill, given that we are confronted almost weekly with new revelations about financial scandals, tax evasion and fraud.  The Tánaiste said she shared my concern but that the Government would not take special legislative steps to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>This reaction does not inspire confidence.  It confirms public cynicism about the relationship between Government and big business, that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor and that there is no real justice and equality in the State.  Worst of all, it is a provocation to those many honest taxpayers and PAYE workers.  It says they are fools to have thought ethics demanded that everyone pay their fair share and shoulder the burden for schools, hospitals and education, which are essential services in a civilised society, and that, all along, they have been laughed at by a certain sector in society which has been mollycoddled by the financial institutions and banks and by certain parties in the State.</P>
      <P>There has been no urgency about tackling the problem of tax evasion and fraud because the banks and political parties enjoy an extremely cosy relationship.  The Government claimed this was a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Surely we, as public representatives, must keep a close eye on them and on the Central Bank.  Are these institutions accountable to anyone?  Why did the Revenue Commissioners not take action against Charles Haughey for many years?  Why were NIB, Guinness Mahon and AIB allowed to proceed with fraudulent schemes for years?</P>
      <P>We have been told by no less a person than the Minister for Finance that any interference with the unethical rights of the privileged would cause a flight of capital and endanger the economy. Therefore, the law cannot be enforced, law breakers cannot be punished and justice cannot be done.  Law breakers are in a more powerful position than those who obey the law.  Those who break the law call the shots.  That is not the basis on which to run a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message it sends out is clear: one can cheat, swindle, steal and break the law because ethics are for suckers.  If one is rich enough, one can get away with it and be lauded in our society. Witness Larry Goodman swanning around the ploughing championships and being asked for his opinions on the state of the economy.  It is sickening. <Col N="1538" /> This morning, I spoke to a widow whose pension is being taxed and she is very angry.</P>
    <P>It is time to call a halt.  It is payback time, and the only way honest taxpayers can be repaid is by punishing those in the Revenue Commissioners who ignored this problem and those in the financial institutions who facilitated tax evasion and hold to account those politicians who have the power to introduce stricter legislation.  Only then will justice be seen to have been done and can we begin to restore the faith of ordinary people in society and in the political system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> A few months back, a Government Minister was charged in the Dáil with receiving £30,000 from business interests.  The House was full on that occasion with the serried ranks of Ministers and Deputies. Today, we ask questions about taxpayers being robbed blind of a massive £80 million and only a single Member is present on the Government side.  Unconsciously, a message is sent out to tax evaders that the issue does not concern the Government.</P>
      <P>The scandalous deal made by the Revenue Commissioners was preceded by the 1987 tax amnesty of the Fianna Fáil Government, and it foreshadowed the 1993 tax amnesty of the Lab-our-Fianna Fáil Government, when hundreds of millions of pounds owed by tax evaders were written off.  It is no surprise that the Revenue Commissioners make deals of this nature when their political masters show them the way.  In the past few weeks, decent compliant PAYE taxpayers, who took a principled stand in boycotting an unjust water tax, had their names splashed all over <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> for arrears of a mere £210. Allied Irish Banks walks away with £80 million of taxpayers' funds and what is the story?  &mdash;<i>omerta</i>, the Mafia code of silence.  It is time these institutions were taken from the hands of this unaccountable, greedy minority and put into public ownership so they can be used for social purposes for the good of the people, not to enrich a few faceless individuals who are a law unto themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the revelations last March-April in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, did the Minister for Finance have discussions with the then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners?  What information did the Minister receive?  What did he know about what went on?  What action did he take to ensure that the taxes foregone in 1991 were collected by the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for making an important contribution to this debate.  As far as the Government is concerned, every effort will be made to root out, condemn and bring to book those who have been involved in any tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> I have answered the questions asked which are within my remit.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Owen's question, at that time there was contact with the Revenue Commissioners. The Department and the Minister were assured that the Revenue Commissioners were fully investigating the matters.  As I have stated, the Revenue Commissioners had already initiated investigations when the article was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in April.  This was reiterated by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners today.</P>
    <P>It is important to put this in context.  Earlier today the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners said: &ldquo;What I am saying is that the disclosures made in the <i>Irish Independent</i> earlier this year was information which we previously had not got&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An ongoing investigation is being conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, not only into the institution mentioned in <i>Magill</i>, but also into the full range of banking institutions.  Serious and definitive questions are being raised with those institutions and answers are being sought.  The full extent of the picture is not yet clear.  Whatever emerges in the context of possible settlements will be made public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the Minister for Finance had discussions in March when this story appeared, before which the commissioners had additional information to show that what they did in 1991 should not have been done.  Is the Minister of State saying that the Minister for Finance has known about this for a minimum of six to eight months?  What did he do?  Why did he not go public and indicate the Government's intent that back taxes would be collected from this institution?  Why was this kept hidden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to put a spin on what I said.  I did not say that the Minister was engaged in discussions.  I said that the Revenue Commissioners informed the Minister, on foot of a reply that he gave to Deputy Rabbitte in the House which was on the basis of the article, that a full investigation was and had been under way by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister was satisfied that all possible action was being taken by the Revenue Commissioners, the body charged with that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very interesting.  We are routinely told that the Revenue Commissioners do not discuss the affairs of individual taxpayers with the Minister.  The Minister makes a virtue of this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear.  I did not say in my reply to Deputy Owen that the Minister <Col N="1540" /> discussed the individual case to which the Deputy has referred with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What did he discuss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To be absolutely clear, the Revenue Commissioners had already initiated investigations prior to the article being published.  I believe the article appeared in April.  On foot of the article, there was further checking with the Revenue Commissioners who assured the Minister that the investigations were inclusive of the matters raised.  There was no specific discussion between the Minister on any single detail of that case.  It was on the general principle of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that, in the course of a conversation, presumably between the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister, the words &ldquo;Allied Irish Banks&rdquo; or the names of individual taxpayers or companies were not mentioned?  Let us be realistic.  If the chairman was talking about an ongoing investigation surely he gave some information to the Minister about what that investigation was looking into.  If he did we are entitled to know.  The Minister of State must appreciate the annoyance and anger in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>So much of this was known to people on the Government side of the House.  We have been deceived.  We have not been told the full facts.  More was known for some time to people on that side of the House and to the Revenue Commissioners.  Were the Minister of State or the Government aware of any other ongoing investigations, settlements or abuses of this kind?  Can we at least have a clear answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to deal with that question. I assure the House that the Deputy is absolutely incorrect to infer that the Government, myself or the Cabinet were aware for some time of the details of this matter.  The Government has been aware of what the Minister for Finance stated some time ago, that there was an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners into these matters.  No report has been made to the Government. These investigations are ongoing by the Revenue Commissioners and no conclusions have been reached.  I spoke to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners today so that I could be clear that what I was going to say to the House was accurate.  I have informed the House of what he told me &mdash; there are ongoing investigations which include the institution mentioned and a range of other institutions going back to that time to see if there are other matters concerning other institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that information would be made public after further discussions.  What information will be made <Col N="1541" /> public?  Will the Minister of State accept that there is no accountability on the part of the Revenue Commissioners because of the confidentiality clause?  Will he also accept that, despite the efforts of the Public Accounts Committee, we have been unable to secure accountability because of the confidentiality clause?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that we cannot get accountability from the Revenue Commissioners because of the confidentiality clause?  Because of that fact we do not know whether they were complicit in any way. Would he also accept that, because of the deficiencies of the compellability provisions, it will not be possible to bring the financial institutions to account?  In light of this fact, will the Government consider a further tribunal to investigate this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When I said that information would be made public, I meant that any settlement agreed in any of these cases will be made public.  This was a reference to the previous cases in 1991 not being in the public domain.  I was making it clear that these will be made public under the law.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's second point with regard to the Revenue Commissioners.  We have to be clear that the Revenue Commissioners work on the basis on independence.  That underpins how we operate our system in Irish tax law. Almost all of those who have contributed to this debate have served in Government in recent years and have been party to substantially improving the regulatory system and Finance Acts.  The Revenue Commissioners, as constituted, are independent and must be allowed carry out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the answer given to me by the Minister for Finance on 28 April.  I may have said that that was prompted by a story in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, but I should have referred to Liam Collins of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as being the author.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clear up the question of the amnesty?  Can we be sure the 1993 amnesty was not applied in this case?  One presumes the institution concerned was satisfied it had entered into an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners and that there was no need to avail of the amnesty.  What is the Minister of State's knowledge of this matter?  Is he aware of the views of the Comptroller and Auditor General on this issue?  For example, is he aware that in his 1997 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed concern about what he called the &ldquo;settlement culture&rdquo; prevailing in the Revenue Commissioners?  In the light of the biggest write-off ever this year in the history of tax collection, which some of us were prepared to take at face <Col N="1542" /> value, on the basis of acknowledging bankruptcies and liquidations and writing them off in advance, that settlement culture could be a matter of concern.  Is the Minister of State aware of similar investigations by the Revenue Commissioners into practices in other financial institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The deep concern about this issue is shared by all of us as demonstrated by actions taken in financial matters in recent years.  On the specific question of the amnesty, I do not have that information.  I do not know the tax arrangements made in any individual case, nor would I be privy to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State think it is a fair question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be questions to be asked but I am not in a position to get that information because that is a matter of confidentiality between the Revenue and the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the implications of the question and the reason it is asked.  I am simply saying I do not have that information.  Given that Deputy Rabbitte is a member of both committees and since the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners will be coming before the Committee of Public Accounts next week I am sure he will have an opportunity to raise the matter with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he agree that under the accountable system the Minister should have the answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree on this fundamental point.  I do not think that politicians should be directly involved in the affairs of individual taxpayers in the way implied by the Deputy.  That would be a dangerous cross-over in terms of good practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that tax evasion is endemic in our society given that even political parties operated the famous pick-me-up system?  What does the Minister of State think of the statement by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who said this would precipitate a crisis if we were to come down hard on tax evasion and that we would then have a flight of capital?  Will he assure the House that the working group, to which he referred, will speed up its work and report back to the House as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe tax evasion is endemic in Irish society and there is no evidence to suggest that is the case.  There has been an <Col N="1543" /> increasing number of prosecutions by the Revenue Commissioners.  The work done by all Members in recent years on Finance Acts, tax law and the various instruments put in place has substantially improved the position.  There is a good working culture in that whole area.  There will always be those who try to abuse the system which is a very good one.  Deputy Gormley suggested there is a complicit arrangement between the Government and big business, but that is not the case.</P>

      <P>We could not have a more open Government.  The Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, increased substantially the powers of the Revenue Commissioners some years ago and was criticised for doing so.  The legislation was described as draconian.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past few days we have witnessed the tragic deaths of two young people in Cork city.  The plague of stealing cars and driving them at great speed has resurfaced in the north side of Dublin.  Every night thousands of my constituents have to endure mayhem. Recently six to eight cars were used to endanger the lives of many citizens.  For a long period law and order appears to have broken down completely. This is in an area where several people suffered fatalities in recent years.  Less than two years ago on Raheny Road an elderly lady died as a result of an horrific accident, which was traumatic for her family and the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> I have raised this matter frequently with the Taoiseach.  While he was walking around the Great Wall of China recently my constituents were engaged in a long march with a view to solving this horrendous problem.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994, which my party was instrumental in helping to enact, allowed the Garda to stop and seize any car driven by an unauthorised driver.  Why is this legislation not used, if necessary, with stingers, subsidiary vehicles and so on.  If further legislation is required, that is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.  Stringent penalties are necessary for those who are prepared to drive a half tonne weight vehicle in a way which has no regard for human life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts being made by the local gardaí in the J and R districts of my constituency but they do not have sufficient resources.  My constituency which has a population equivalent to Limerick city has only one third of the number of gardaí in that city.  Will the Minister consider allocating an extra 50 officers to the Raheny and Coolock stations, specifically to help curb this problem?  In recent months the Garda Commissioner has had a strong media presence.  It is essential that, if he is serious about his plans for policing, he invests resources in areas which require them.  Many citizens believe there is a policy of containment in certain deprived areas of this type of very ugly crime rather than it being dealt with on the public highway and preventing movement into estates where citizens are especially vulnerable.  We may have to again examine the concept of a police force for Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been a longstanding failure on the part of the local authority in providing necessary community facilities.  However, the Minister is probably aware &mdash; the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste certainly are &mdash; that the community of Darndale and Belcamp in my constituency has made an outstanding effort to get a new village centre at a cost of £5 million.  We are £700,000 short of the amount required and despite repeated requests to the Taoiseach and the Minister, and despite a budget surplus of £100 million this year, it does not seem that the Government will make up the shortfall.  The relevance of this is that one of the central areas on the north side where the mayhem is happening is the site of the current very debilitated and poorly presented shopping centre area in the Darndale-Belcamp parish.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to convey to the Taoiseach the urgent necessity for him, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and the agencies involved to try to put into the area the necessary resources for youth and recreation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, years ago Dublin Corporation in the many areas to which I have referred did not put in a proper system of security for residents or youth and other facilities.  In recent years there has been some improvement in this regard, but <Col N="1545" /> we still need much more autonomy and local empowerment.</P>
    <P>I represent up to 60,000 very angry people in five or six parishes from Coolock to Raheny and Kilbarrack who are outraged that this dastardly crime has returned to haunt them.  They are particularly worried that in the weeks leading up to Halloween, which is sometimes an occasion for this type of mayhem, &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; will again destroy their lives and perhaps remove somebody completely from the family circle.  I ask the Minister to take whatever urgent action is necessary to address the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for giving me the opportunity to set out the Garda response to the anti-social criminal activity known as &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; in north-side Dublin and throughout the State.  Despite improvements in the overall crime situation, the problem of &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; is still a serious one in some communities.  It is one manifestation of the disorderly and criminal tendencies of a small minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds where disadvantage of various kinds is a factor.  Disadvantage is not an excuse but it points to the need for a broad based inter-agency approach to the problem involving the Garda, local authorities, State services and local community groups.  So far as the Garda Síochána is concerned I have been assured that the commissioner is determined to continue to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that gardaí have the power and resources to deal with the problem and that I will continue to support the commissioner's campaign against so-called joyriding.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that higher visibility patrols using four-wheel drive vehicles are in operation and regular checkpoints are carried out.  I am also informed that the Garda air support unit has been used successfully on a number of occasions to detect and apprehend offenders.  Gardaí also have the vehicle stopping device known as the stinger, although it is not automatically used in every case of &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;. The safety of the general public is the primary concern and an assessment must be made in each instance by a senior ranking garda as to whether it is safe to use the stinger in terms of not endangering innocent parties.  In addition, under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, gardaí have the power to stop and seize vehicles they believe to be driven by drivers who, by reason of their age, are ineligible to hold a driving licence or insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their ongoing campaign against &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;, the Garda Síochána is deeply conscious of the need to secure the support of the public in the worst affected areas.  This is why as well as apprehending offenders gardaí are and will continue to meet with community groups who are angered by the activities of unruly criminal elements.  I support and fund programmes which are community <Col N="1546" /> based and which are designed to draw young people away from crime, including &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;. Two such schemes are the juvenile diversion project for Priorswood/Darndale and the working to enhance Blanchardstown project on Dublin's north side.  Through the combined efforts of local agencies, these projects aim at identifying the young people at risk and assessing intervention programmes to service their needs; promoting productive and creative use of the target groups leisure time with a view to enabling their integration into main stream youth activity groups and liaising closely with parents, schools, other agencies and the community in general.  The programmes are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting and otherwise, counselling, informal group work, education, group family and after care programmes; anti-vandalism / pro-environment programmes and other activities deemed appropriate.  My Department continues to support and fund such schemes.  The aim of these projects is to prevent crime and to direct young people from becoming involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour and to improve the quality of life for young people.</P>
    <P>Incidents of &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; as outlined by the Deputy will continue because, despite the efforts of the Garda, parents and community groups, there are still young people who act irresponsibly and steal cars with the added risk to themselves and the general public.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular areas referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have introduced special patrols in several areas of north-side Dublin and have prepared suitable plans aimed at reversing the rise in the unauthorised taking of vehicles.  In addition, a number of gardaí have received instruction in the use and operation of the stinger stopping device to which I referred earlier and which has been used as deemed appropriate.  I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that gardaí have met Dublin Corporation with a view to introducing additional vehicle restriction measures in the Darndale area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure the House that the Garda will not let up in its continuing campaign against &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; and will continue to work with local communities, local authorities and State services so that all possible steps are taken to deter so-called joyriding.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, I have grave reservations about the fact that less than an hour ago three Ministers from the Department of Health and Children were in the House and that not one of them will answer a major issue in relation to health care, namely, the waiting lists for acute hospital services.  I do not wish to be disrespectful to the Minister of State, Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> Molloy, but it shows the level of disregard in the Department and it is shameful that no Health Minister will come to the House to reply to this extremely vital issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise the scandal of the increased numbers on hospital waiting lists.  In June 1997 tackling waiting lists was seen as a key priority commitment by the Government, yet there are now almost 35,000 waiting for treatment.  There are well over 6,000 people waiting for orthopaedic treatment, for example, hip replacement operations.  Children as well as adults are on waiting lists.  People are waiting so long for treatment that some will die for want of it.  Already 110 people waiting for heart by-pass operations have died.</P>
    <P>One per cent of the population is on a hospital waiting list, an incredible feature of society.  It is a devastating reality for the people concerned, particularly at a time when the economy is booming and the Exchequer is awash with money.  This week alone, one consultant doctor in St. Vincent's Hospital had three patients with cancer of the pancreas and two with cancer of the liver but could not get any of them admitted for surgery. One of the patients has been awaiting treatment since July.  The tumours from which these people suffer do not go away; the cancer grows and spreads and, without treatment, the life expectancy of these patients will be severely shortened.  At a time of plenty, they cannot get treatment.  That would not have been the case 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>We know from the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled that 41 beds were closed in St. Vincent's Hospital this year for an average of eight weeks.  That works out at approximately 300 bed nights. I am not singling out St. Vincent's for any particular reason; it is a random example selected to put some kind of human shape on the statistics.  The extent of bed closures is frightening, particularly in view of the fact that the leaked report from the review group has cited hospital capacity as an obstacle to treatment for those who need it.  Over the summer, more than 750 acute beds were closed in hospitals, not for maintenance or refurbishment but purely for budgetary reasons.  This highlights more than anything the necessity for immediate investment to deal with the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the leaked findings of the report commissioned by the Minister.  It is regrettable that, in spite of all the media coverage, the report is still being withheld.  As a first step to show his serious intent, I suggest the Minister publish this report immediately.  We are all aware that the Minister alone cannot tackle the waiting lists.  The service providers &mdash; the medical profession, hospitals and health boards &mdash; all have a part to play.  By delaying publication of the report, the Minister is sending out the message that he is not really serious about tackling the lists and that this is not really a serious issue.  That people will continue to suffer and die is a serious <Col N="1548" /> issue which demands a response from him.  Otherwise, the public might suspect that the Minister and his Department have succumbed to some kind of political sleeping sickness of their own.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the fact that £800 million will be available to the Government in the forthcoming budget?  How will investment be allocated to deal with the acute hospital waiting lists which are growing daily as a result of Government inaction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this Adjournment Debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  In response to the comments made by Deputy McManus earlier, it was common practice in the Government in which she participated for colleague Ministers to deal with Adjournment matters when it was not possible for them to be present in the House.  I am surprised by her comments as I witnessed this practice being adhered to by the Deputy's own party when it was in Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is fully aware of Deputies' concerns regarding public waiting lists.  However, a number of important points must be made to place this issue in context. Waiting lists are an international problem; they are not specific to Ireland alone.  In common with many other countries, we must tackle waiting lists as an ongoing issue.  The Minister strongly believes we must not lose sight of the importance of waiting times as opposed to waiting lists.  A patient could be on a very short waiting list for a particular specialty but might have to wait a lengthy period before being treated.  On the other hand, a patient may be seen quickly, even though the waiting list on which they appear may be relatively long.  It is, therefore, the length of time a patient must wait on which the Minister is focusing his energies rather than concentrating solely on the absolute number of patients on the lists.</P>
      <P>There were some positive developments in relation to waiting times in the figures for June of this year.  In a number of specialties, the length of time patients had to wait for treatment decreased.  For example, waiting times for adults requiring treatment in cardiac surgery, general surgery and urology fell between March and June of this year.  Similarly, there were improvements in waiting times for children in cardiac surgery and ear, nose and throat procedures.  Since taking office, the Government has been committed to addressing both waiting lists and waiting times. This year, the Minister allocated £12 million for waiting list work, some 50 per cent more than the previous Government allocated in 1997.  He also ensured that the funds were issued to hospitals at the beginning of the year rather than in the middle of the year as had happened previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April of this year, the Minister established a review group on the waiting list initiative.  He asked the group to examine both the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times and how <Col N="1549" /> best the problems in these areas might be addressed.  He received the review group's report in August and has assessed its recommendations. A key message from the report is that there are no quick-fix solutions to addressing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The contents of the report have been the subject of consultation by the Minister and his Department with the Department of Finance in the ongoing discussions on the Estimates for 1999.  The Minister is confident that the co-ordinated, focused approach recommended by the review group will be successful.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment to addressing waiting lists and waiting times.  We will introduce initiatives in the short, medium and long term for this purpose but there are no simple solutions to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tubbercurry is a thriving and developing town in urgent need of a modern, state of the art fire fighting facility.  The existing fire station is only a garage and a purpose built fire station is required to serve Tubbercurry and its large catchment area.  The existing fire station was built in the early 1950s, more than 40 years ago.  The fire engine at the time was a Landrover type vehicle which served its purpose quite well. However, times have changed and Tubbercurry now has a modern fire fighting engine which must be reversed into the existing station leaving only two inches' clearance from the roof and very little clearance from the sides and the door.</P>
      <P>There are no facilities to clean hoses and ladders, repair essential equipment, such as breathing apparatus, dry clothes or even make a cup of tea.  All maintenance work has to be carried out outdoors.  Fire drills must be carried out 25 miles away in Sligo town.  No facilities are available to watch videos or attend lectures on up-to-date fire fighting practices.  Water drills must be carried out ten miles away and the local NCF co-op is used for ladder drills.  Toilet facilities are shared with local county council employees and no shower or drying facilities are available.  Because of the location of the existing building, there is great difficulty entering and exiting it.  It must be remembered that every exit from a fire station is, of its nature, an emergency exit.</P>
      <P>The town of Tubbercurry has grown considerably in recent years.  There is a hotel, a hostel, a number of restaurants, several bed and breakfast premises, a number of factories which contain highly flammable material, public houses and a large number of shops, churches, schools and so on.  This is a thriving town with a large catchment area taking in the villages of Bellaghy, Curry, Aclare, Cloonacool, Coolaney, Ballinacarrow and many more villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who operate this fire service have provided an outstanding service over the years, but the conditions in which they work have deteriorated in recent times.  They serve a large area of south Sligo and beyond.  They often have <Col N="1550" /> to travel long distances during hot spells &mdash;&mdash; though not this year &mdash; to deal with forest fires on mountains and other inaccessible areas.  They have returned from such calls of duty exhausted and wet but the station lacks proper facilities and has no place for drying.</P>
    <P>I now call on the Minister to make funding available as a matter of priority for a new purpose built fire station in Tubbercurry.  I would appreciate it if the funds could be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The need for a new fire station in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, is accepted by the Department. Approval in principle for the proposed new fire station issued to Sligo County Council in January 1993.  Since then, the plans for the project at Tubbercurry were revised by the council and the revised plans were submitted to the Department in June 1996.  These were approved in November 1996 and contract documents and a cost plan were subsequently submitted by the county council to the Department on 11 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The next stage in the development of this project is the invitation of tenders for the work. However, having regard to the capital available for the fire services capital programme and the current level of demands and commitments under the programme, I cannot say at this stage when it may be allowed to proceed to tender stage.</P>
      <P>The capital provisions for the fire services programme nationally in 1998 is £5.033 million, the highest annual allocation since 1991.  This provision reflects the continuing commitment of successive Governments to capital investment in the fire service.  Since 1980 and up to and including 1998, over £93.5 million has been invested by the State in the fire services capital programme.  This has resulted in major improvements in the fire services on a comprehensive basis, such as the provision of new and refurbished fire stations, the purchase of modern fire appliances and equipment, improved training facilities and better mobilisation and communications systems.  The improvements that have been made in fire service infrastructure are there for all to see.</P>
      <P>County Sligo has benefited well from these improvements.  Of the four fire stations in the county, new stations were completed at Sligo in 1982 and at Enniscrone as recently at 1996.  A sum of £1.2 million was committed for these works and, in addition, over £500,000 capital has been made available for appliances and equipment for the brigades in Sligo.  Indeed, only in February last, the Department approved the purchase of a new fire appliance for the fire service in Sligo which will cost almost £140,000 and is due to be delivered shortly.  Also, last August, the council's proposal to seek tenders for the new mobilising alerter system for its fire service was approved.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have, therefore, been achieved already, and I can assure Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Brennan that the Department is fully aware of the fire service needs in Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to take this very pressing and urgent matter.  I would like also to acknowledge his personal efforts to resolve this serious problem but, regrettably, they are not enough.</P>
      <P>The reason I urgently sought this debate was to put on record the very serious dilemma faced by many of my constituents in Cavan and Monaghan who are in pig production.  I am not talking about commercial enterprises but small family farms.  I have had visits from a number of those people.  While I do not want to overstate the case, they are in a serious situation.  While some of them feel they are on the verge of a nervous breakdown, others feel suicidal.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem in Donegal, and as Deputy McGinley is in the House I would like to give him a minute of my time.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State is <i>au fait</i> with the pigmeat industry and the collapse in the market. About five years ago at a two day seminar at Ballyhaise Agricultural College farmers were advised to get into pig production as an alternative enterprise.  They were told we could push production here to four million units per annum and that there was ample scope for developing a good alternative enterprise to their current family farm business.  With this in mind these people expanded; they pumped in their profits and they involved themselves in small borrowings to set up units of 200 to 250 sows.  Their costs are running at 95p per kilogram &mdash; those are Teagasc's figures, the people who advised them &mdash; but they are getting a price of 72p per kilogram; they are losing 23p per kilogram.  On the average weight of pig sold at slaughter they are losing £17.25. One farmer and his wife who sell an average of 110 pigs per week are losing £1,725 per week, or almost £8,000 per month.  That is substantial money to be losing on top of what they are borrowing. Over the past number of months they have found themselves with debts in excess of £40,000.  They are bewildered.  They are running out of money.  Their children are suffering. Another farmer with an average throughput of 140 pigs per week is losing £2,415 per week, and has to beg people to take his pigs.  He is losing over £10,000 per month and has massive debts. These people always prided themselves on paying their way, on building their businesses and owing nothing yet here they find themselves, through no fault of their own, in a shocking morass of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear for their future.  Urgent action is needed. The Minister should give a subvention to units of up to 200 sows.  ICOS should be asked to come in.  These are family farms, and that is what the co-operative movement is all about.  The Minister <Col N="1552" /> of State, as the person responsible, will have to seek more from the Government and the Minister for Finance to help these people until the market comes right.  That will happen, but these people will not be around if we wait much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Boylan for giving me a minute of his valuable time.  I support the eloquent case he has put to the Minister of State.  All I would like to add is that if the situation is serious in Cavan, Monaghan and the Border areas, it is even more serious in Donegal. There is a crisis there among pig farmers.  A number of weeks ago the Minister of State went to Letterkenny and got first-hand information but matters have deteriorated on a weekly basis since then.  The pig farmers in Donegal are at their wits end because they cannot sell their pigs due to a number of factors; any pigs they sell do not command the prices made by pig producers in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The situation is critical.  The Minister of State is an expert in this field and I appeal to him, as my colleague, Deputy Boylan, has already done, to do something, even if he has to produce a rabbit from a hat.  We must safeguard the future of these people who invested so much over the years in this particular type of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Boylan and McGinley for raising this matter.  I have also spoken privately to them and others about this major problem which is affecting farming.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the crisis, I would like to put on record that Council Directive No. 91/630/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Welfare of Pigs) Regulations, 1995.  As a result, Ireland is fully complying with EU rules on pig welfare, particularly in the discharge by my Department of regular inspections of pig units under the rules.  I am acutely aware of the welfare aspect to the current difficulties in the pig sector and I am keeping it under review.</P>
      <P>The current difficulties in the pig industry stem from an oversupply of pigmeat in the EU as a whole.  The oversupply has resulted from increased production in many member states, including Ireland, following high market prices last year and previously.  The high prices were brought about by a shortage of pig supplies on the market, following the slaughter of over ten million pigs as a result of outbreaks of classical swine fever in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had the problems of BSE in 1996, when there was a downturn in beef consumption and an increase in pork consumption, which has now levelled off, creating further difficulties for the industry.  Many of the problems have been brought about by unplanned production arising from the issues I outlined.  There has been a <Col N="1553" /> downturn in the world market.  We had a large market for pork in the Pacific Rim, specifically Japan and Korea, but there is little or no market there at present due to their economic problems. We are well aware of the huge storage of pork in many countries awaiting the opening of that market.</P>
    <P>The disease is now almost eliminated, and production in the affected member states has been brought back to pre-disease levels.  The result is that the EU is currently 108 per cent self-sufficient in pigmeat.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of measures to alleviate the difficulties facing pig producers.  In May I sought and secured from the Commission export refunds for pigmeat.  In August, following further requests from me, the Commission increased the refunds and introduced refunds for pigmeat products which previously did not attract a refund.</P>
    <P>In September, Ireland, together with other member states, pressed for the introduction of an aids for private storage scheme.  I am happy to say the Commission responded positively and introduced an APS scheme with effect from 28 September.  The scheme allows for EU funding for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat for up to a period of six months.  On exit from storage, the pigmeat must be exported from the Community and, depending on the product involved, will attract in addition a refund on export.  I am confident that these measures will have the desired effect of improving pigmeat market prices which, in turn, will benefit the income of producers.</P>
    <P>The market in Ireland has been exacerbated by a fire in a pig processing plant last June in Northern Ireland.  This plant was taking about 5,000 pigs per week for slaughter from southern producers. The fire caused problems in the slaughtering of pigs in the South, in that a backlog of <Col N="1554" /> pigs awaiting slaughter built up.  To deal with this, arrangements were put in place, following agreement between my Department, the IFA and the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors, to slaughter pigs on a Saturday or on overtime during the week.  The backlog has now been greatly reduced.  The problem of overhang of pigs on the market should be further lessened with the recent purchase of the Unipork plant in Northern Ireland by the company whose premises were destroyed by fire.</P>
    <P>The slaughtering facilities in the South will be further helped by the recent announcement that the McCarren plant in Cavan is expected to reopen shortly.  In that regard, my Department has been approached by a company which intends to lease the plant.  The company is headed by some pig producers and they have asked the Department to carry out a veterinary inspection of the premises with a view to giving the necessary approval for activities to be resumed at the plant.  This request was made two days ago and arrangements are in place to have this inspection carried out next Monday.</P>
    <P>If the inspection meets the Department's standards, approval to operate the plant will be given. Once the plant resumes activities, it will have a major positive impact on pig producers in the Border region regarding pig slaughterings.</P>
    <P>At the September Council of Agriculture Ministers I again requested the Commission to increase export refunds, particularly for the Russian market which continues to be difficult.  I am keeping the market under review and I will continue to press the Commission to ensure that EU pigmeat traders can compete on world markets and, thus, ensure that primary producers can earn a reasonable return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,300 hospital consultants in the public sector.  The question of appointing more hospital consultants is linked to the bigger issue of medical manpower in the hospital system The number of new hospital consultant posts approved in 1998 is 52.  The number of consultant posts has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last ten years.  There is a need for a more fundamental review of the medical staffing in public hospitals.  That is why I have established a major new initiative on medical manpower.</P>
      <P>The focus of the medical manpower initiative in the general hospital sector concerns addressing the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in this country and the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of medical manpower is now required.  At present there are approximately two junior doctors for every consultant employed. Non-consultant hospital doctors regard career prospects as poor and a large number emigrate. Young doctors tend to leave at the point where they have just acquired the skills and expertise and are ready to make a real contribution to Irish hospitals.</P>
      <P>Women doctors also leave the system and we need to examine the reasons that this is happening so that solutions can be found to facilitate the optimum use of their skills and develop training structures to accommodate their needs.</P>
      <P>Other areas which require attention are the different needs of larger and smaller hospitals, combining other disciplines with medical staffing, for example, general practitioners and nurses and coping with the demographic changes which have occurred in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I have, therefore, established a forum on medical manpower which in association with the various medical interests will address longer term contracts for non-consultant hospital doctors, a system of structured rotations that include training in the larger teaching hospitals as well as small general hospitals, revised arrangements for medical training and the need to take into account the requirements of women, institutional structural reform to allocate clear responsibility for ensuring the quality of training in Irish hospitals, centralising responsibility for medical manpower to include responsibility for all medical manpower, the need for another career grade of doctor who would have additional responsibility for delivering a quality hospital service and the need to place more fully trained doctors in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>The forum which has met three times is examining areas such as the adequacy of medical cover in the hospital system and the ratio of doctors in Ireland compared with other EU states and I do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of the forum by commenting on these specific issues at this time. I am hopeful however that what emerges beings to resolve the medical manpower problems in the Irish context and will take into account the special needs of our public hospital system.</P>

    <P>I am advised by the board that the need for a community hospital in Tralee has been identified.

These developments range from the provision of community support services to the establishment of a day hospital and rehabilitation unit at Tralee General Hospital. The Southern Health Board's priorities for the improvement of services for older people in County Kerry will be the subject of detailed discussions with my Department and will be advanced as resources permit.  In this regard I should point out that I have provided additional capital funding of the order of £3.25 million to the Southern Health Board in 1998 for the improvement of facilities for older people, including <Col N="1557" /> the upgrading of a community hospital in Dingle and the provision of day care facilities also in Dingle.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need to develop the home help service which provides a key support service for dependent people in their homes.  Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation and development of the home help service in Ireland by the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be published shortly.  I intend to give its recommendations full consideration with a view to early implementation subject to the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>I fully adhere to the principle that where a child requires care outside their own family, in particular if they require care for long periods, they should, as a general rule be cared for in another family.  Arising from that, it is Government policy to promote foster care as the best means for caring for children outside the home and health boards are fully in agreement with this approach.</P>
      <P>In this regard I am in the process of establishing a working group to review all aspects of foster care.  The group will include representatives from the health boards, the Irish Foster Care Association and officials from the Department of Health and Children.  I will be announcing the membership of this working group very shortly.  I will also be announcing a number of new initiatives aimed at enhancing foster care services.</P>
      <P>Deputies may wish to note that on 5 June this year I increased the foster care allowances from £57.75 per week to £60.25 per week for foster children under 12, and from £64.70 per week to £73.75 per week for children over the age of 12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 68 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  It should also be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependents without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review the medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  My Department has sought the views of health board chief executive officers as to how the commitment might be implemented and the implications, financial and otherwise of their proposals.  My Department is currently examining the chief executive officers' response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> The estimated cost of extending medical card eligibility to those over the age of 65 is in the region of £30 million.  However, this figure does not take account of the costs involved in the drugs refund scheme, DRS, attributable to people over 65 who do not currently have a medical card. This cost would have to be offset against the above figure.  Since repayments on the DRS are based on expenditure by individuals or families and do not relate to the age of a person it is not possible to give an exact figure for the costs for those over 65 but it is estimated to be in the region of £4 million.  Similarly costs of other health and social services which may be made available without charge to medical card holders are not included in the estimate above.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future of the general medical service developments will aim to ensure that both the general practitioner and community pharmacy services are better organised and supported in fulfilling a more integrated role within the overall health care system in order to deliver a service which provides health and social gains consistent with the principles, set out in the health strategy, of equity, quality of service and accountability.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 23, 48, 58 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The promotion of breastfeeding continues to be a priority for my Department and the need to increase its incidence is referred to in the national breastfeeding strategy, the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and the health promotion strategy.</P>
      <P>The National Breastfeeding Policy for Ireland, published in 1994, recognised that the immediate support of health professionals is essential to achieving an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding. The encouragement and advice of this group is critical as they help expectant mothers form opinions both during pregnancy and immediately after birth.  For these reasons, the health promotion unit of my Department provided funding in the first instance for the production of a training pack for health professionals which was developed in conjunction with the Centre for Health Promotion Studies in University College Galway and An Bord Altranais.  This pack provides health professionals with the necessary expertise to encourage and assist mothers with breastfeeding and has been widely disseminated.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign lead by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, has recently been established in Ireland.  Participation in this initiative was also recommended in the National Breastfeeding Policy for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the &ldquo;Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative&rdquo; supports informed parental choice through the provision of appropriate and accurate information and discussions.  I am confident that the introduction of the initiative will <Col N="1561" /> contribute to increasing the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>
    <P>I should add that the health promotion unit of my Department also continues to support a number of voluntary organisations involved in encouraging mothers to breastfeed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 33, 38, 47, 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I received the report of the Commission on Nursing on 16 September last.</P>
      <P>The aim of the report of the Commission on Nursing, A Blueprint for the Future, is to develop the profession of nursing.  Its recommendations are designed to free the profession from controls, practices and attitudes that have held nursing and midwifery in check, and which have prevented it achieving its full potential in the health services and in society.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the commission's vision for enhancing the role of nurses and midwives, and I welcome the blueprint for the development of the profession.  I want to assure the House that the commission's report will be acted upon.  This is a very important report, which has been compiled following a most comprehensive examination of the issues of concern to the profession and the most extensive consultation process ever undertaken in the area of nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many of you will be aware, at the launch of the report I announced details of the specific measures I am taking as an immediate response <Col N="1563" /> to the commission's report.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my commitment to bringing about the fundamental institutional and structural reforms recommended by the commission. I emphasise that the implementation of the report will be done on a partnership basis. Accordingly, I will be issuing invitations to the trade unions to work with my Department, the Health Services Employers Agency and the health boards and voluntary agencies on the implementation of this report on an ongoing basis over a period of years.  The actual implementation process will of necessity take several years to complete and a huge amount of work will have to be carried out if all of the 200 recommendations are to be implemented in a streamlined and effective manner.  The commission itself was critical of the haste with which the pre-registration diploma programme was put in place and has signalled that any further developments should be carried out over a period of years to ensure that any new programmes are put in place with the minimum of disruption.  This is the first occasion on which the implementation of a major report like this is being dealt with by way of a partnership model.  I am sure that the good will necessary from all sides will be forthcoming to ensure that this type of implementation process will come to be regarded as a new and better way of doing things in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the report, I gave a commitment to immediately introduce six measures in response to the commission's recommendations. These six measures are as follows: the introduction of new legislation to amend the Nurses Act, 1985; the establishment of a representative forum to prepare the ground for moving pre-registration nursing education and training to a four-year degree programme in time for the 2002 intake of nursing students; the establishment of a National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery; the establishment of a nursing and midwifery planning and development unit in each of the eight health boards; the strengthening of the nursing policy division in the Department of Health and Children through the appointment of additional nursing staff on a contract basis; and the greater involvement of nurses in the management of the health services.</P>
    <P>As regards the recommendations of the commission relating to pay matters, the position is that health services management have been invited to attend the Labour Court on Wednesday, 28 October 1998 and I can confirm that they will be in attendance.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that the report of the Commission on Nursing be read by all nurses and midwives throughout the country.  It is crucially important that they fully understand the context in which the commission reached its conclusions, and the impact that the implementation of its recommendations will have on the future direction of their profession and the development of their role in the health services.  The commission's <Col N="1564" /> report is all about tackling the underlying problems affecting the profession, rather than just the symptoms of those problems.  With the objective of ensuring that the general body of nurses and midwives is given an opportunity to study the commission's report, I have arranged for a copy of the report along with a copy of my address to the Commission on Nursing outlining my programme of action for the implementation of its report, to be sent to every practising nurse and midwife in the public health sector.  I understand that delivery of the reports from the printers is scheduled to begin in a few days time.</P>

      <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 which is based on Information from the National Intellectual Disability Database provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places during the period 1997-2001.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the revenue cost of providing the required services will be in the region of £63.5 million over the period.  The Government's commitment to meeting this cost is clearly set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I have also put in place a major £30 million four year national capital programme, commencing this year, to provide the volume and quality of facilities required to provide these new services and which will run in tandem with the implementation of the needs outlined in the Assessment of Need.  I recently provided further capital funding of £5 million on top of the £30 million national capital programme.  This allocation brings the amount of additional funding allocated by me in the last 12 months to £25 million.  This compares with £12 million allocated under the previous administration in 1997, the first year of the assessment of need.</P>
      <P>My Department, the health boards and the voluntary sector are working in partnership using the existing consultative structures in the field of mental handicap to maximise the benefit of this capital programme, together with funding from other sources which may be available to the services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not collect information in relation to numbers of postponed elective procedures or appointments.</P>
      <P>The level of elective activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available.  This forms a central part of the service planning process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, and which is also engaged in by other agencies not at this stage covered by the Act, including the two, Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals, referred to specifically by Deputy Callely.  In 1998, for the first time, hospitals were advised of their funding allocation under the waiting list initiative at the beginning of the year.  This has enabled improved planning of elective activity for the year as agencies can take account, from the outset, of both projected core activity and activity to be performed under the waiting list initiative in the target specialities.</P>
      <P>In achieving activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local hospital management within an overall budgetary management strategy.  These temporary closures also facilitate annual leave and refurbishment works.  It is important, therefore, that they are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the 12 month period.  In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals for the first six months of this year was almost 4 per cent up on the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that the number of overnight beds in the system at any given time does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day care and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to June 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the <Col N="1566" /> same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day activity is 9.78 per cent.  This significant increase in day work clearly underlines the fact that a temporary reduction in bed numbers in any given location will not necessarily correlate to a similar reduction in activity in terms of total bed days used.</P>
    <P>It has to be understood also that the unpredictable nature of activity generated by emergency admissions means that cancellations of elective procedures are inevitable from time to time in any event as the system tries to cope with unexpected peaks.  As part of the service planning process, it is a matter for agencies to attempt to take account of these peaks and troughs when planning their elective activity levels and temporary bed closures over a 12 month period.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who need a level of care and attention which is substantially greater than that normally required by a child of the same age.  The scheme was introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 in 1973 and operates under section 61 of the 1970 Health Act.  At present the DCA is not payable in respect of children under two years of age as children of that age usually require constant care and attention in any event.</P>
      <P>However, I have received numerous representations in support of a proposal to extend the DCA to cover children under the age of two.  The proposal is under detailed consideration and review by my Department and I expect this review to be completed this month.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the review of the carer's allowance report recently published by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs which makes reference to the DCA scheme.</P>

      <P>The re-location of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater Hospital campus has been under consideration for some time by the religious orders who own the two hospitals concerned.  My Department supports the transfer of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater campus because of the need to improve the quality of paediatric hospital accommodation and the potential benefits to both hospitals of shared infrastructural support and complementary clinical services.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I approved the appointment of the design team for the Mater Hospital development.  Its initial task will be the preparation of a development control plan, DCP, for the entire Mater site, including the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, followed by Phase I of the Mater development.  The relocation of the Children's Hospital is included in Phase II of the development.</P>
      <P>However, in the interim, it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard.  For this reason, my Department recently approved funding of £2 million for the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department and the provision of a new 20 bedded ward at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  Work is well advanced on the planning of this development.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that I have also approved the following funding in 1998 for the Children's Hospital, Temple Street:</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, serves as the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease.  According to figures recently submitted to the Department the hospital currently has 13 patients waiting between three to six months, 56 patients waiting over six months for cardiac surgery and 47 patients waiting over six months for cardiology.</P>
      <P>With regard to waiting times emergency cases are attended to immediately and the average waiting time for routine cases is up to 18 months for cardiac surgery and three months for cardiology.</P>
      <P>Under the 1997 Cardiac Surgery Waiting List Initiative a sum of £500,000 was allocated to the hospital for the purpose of alleviating the waiting list pressures.  The hospital's proposal, agreed with my Department, was to utilise this additional funding to provide the following: increased cardiology out-patient department activity with additional echocardiographs and electrocardiographs; the provision of four additional ICU beds; an additional training programme for ICU nurses; and 18 cardiac procedures to be purchased on a contract basis in the UK.</P>
      <P>This year under the same initiative an increased allocation of £878,550 was made to the hospital.  This provided for additional staff, the purchase of 30 additional cardiac procedures in the UK and the continuation of the ICU nurse training course.</P>
      <P>The development of enhanced paediatric cardiac surgery facilities is at an advanced stage.  This development includes the provision of additional theatres and associated facilities and I recently granted approval to the hospital board to advertise for a design team for the development.  In addition, the appointment of a consultant cardiologist and a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon has been approved by my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal These measures will alleviate the pressures currently being experienced in the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the individual case referred to by the Deputy and I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to the family on their very sad loss.  I assure the Deputy, however, that I have been in touch with the hospital to determine the circumstances of the case and I have been given every assurance that the waiting time for surgery was not a contributory factor in the most unfortunate death of the child.</P>

      <P>One of the most pertinent findings of the review group which examined the McColgan case was that if such a case was to present itself today, the response of the NorthWestern Health Board would have been more efficient in protecting the children.  Major changes which have occurred include the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the investment of £2.6 million in the development of the board's family support and child protection services in the period 1993-98.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a social services inspectorate is a priority for my Department, and the chief inspector will be appointed by the end of the year.  The inspectorate will be invaluable to the ongoing review of standards of child protection services in all health boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 32 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons on waiting lists at the end of June 1998, the latest date for which figures are available is 34,331.  The corresponding figure for June 1997 was 30,453.</P>
      <P>I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998 which represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding made available by the previous Government in 1997.  This funding was made available in January 1998 with the allocation to health agencies thus enabling them to co-ordinate their waiting list initiative activity with their normal activity over the full year.  This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  In addition, in December 1997 my Department issued a policy circular which put in place the following arrangements relating to the waiting list initiative.  Agencies were notified in their determination of net expenditure of the level of funding available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gave agencies early notice of the money available and enabled them to plan their activity accordingly.  Agencies were asked to specify targets for waiting list activity in their service plans during the year.  It is the responsibility of the chief executive officer/hospital manager to ensure that <Col N="1571" /> the targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary.  There will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention.  Agencies were requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with the funding agency.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise the effectiveness of the waiting list initiative, I established a review group consisting of clinicians and managers to consider: the net effect of the current waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting times; any incentive effects of the waiting list initiative on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists; and the adequacy of existing information systems to permit routine evaluation of the waiting list initiative.  I received the report of the review group in August and the contents of the report have been the subject of consultation and discussion by me and my Department with the Department of Finance in the context of the ongoing discussion on the estimates for 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 39, 52 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Viagra is now available on prescription in this country.  However, because of the absence of any <Col N="1573" /> experience in Europe of the demand for the drug by patients or the prescribing patterns of doctors, and because of the issues surrounding the control of the drug, which have been extensively reported in the media, it is difficult at this stage to come to any conclusions on whether Viagra should be available on the general medical services scheme or the community drugs schemes.  An expert group has therefore been established to examine this matter in detail.  Pending the outcome of the group's deliberations, Viagra will not be included in the general medical services scheme or reimbursable under the community drugs schemes. The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, was informed of my decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>The expert group, under the chairmanship of my Department's chief medical officer, Dr Jim Kiely, draws on expertise in urology, endocrinology, pharmacology and general practice.  Its members are Professor John Fitzpatrick, professor of surgery; Mr Eamonn Kiely, consultant urologist; Professor John Feely, professor of pharmacology; Dr Richard Firth, endocrinologist; Dr Ailis Ni Riain, general practitioner; Dr. Patiick O'Meara, general practitioner and Dr. Chris McNamara, general practitioner adviser to my Department.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group are to monitor the demand for Viagra and the prescribing pattern of doctors; to assess the effectiveness of the drug and to recommend a prescribing protocol and controls which will ensure that patients with genuine medical need can obtain the drug under the general medical services scheme or the community drugs schemes as appropriate and protect against misuse.</P>
    <P>The group is being asked to report within three months and to make an interim report at that stage if it is not in a position to make final recommendations.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if it is permissible for a consultant to charge private fees for insured patients where a private bed in public hospital is not available and the person is accommodated in a public bed and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, a private patient being admitted to a public hospital as an elective admission shall not be accommodated in a designated public bed. However, a private patient being admitted to hospital as an emergency admission shall be accommodated in a designated public bed if, and only for such time as, a designated private bed is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a <Col N="1574" /> person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  The current charge of £25 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained up to a maximum of £250 is applicable to both public and private patients.  In addition, private and semi-private maintenance charges are applicable to private patients accommodated in designated private beds.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time.  The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Where a patient chooses to be a private patient, then he-she is liable for consultant fees even when, for reasons of lack of availability of a private bed, he-she has to, as an emergency admission, occupy a public bed.</P>
    <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant by obtaining a private bed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that the public patient waiting list figures furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis do not distinguish between medical card holders and other public patients.  Priority for treatment for public patients is determined on the basis of clinical need.  Regarding the numbers waiting for cardiac surgery at the end of June, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1142 adults and 69 children on the public cardiac surgery waiting list.  A breakdown of this list is contained in the following Table 1.  The Deputy will note from the following Table 2 that the end of June 1998 waiting list total compares favourably with the figures for the same period last year, showing a reduction of 24 per cent for adults awaiting surgery and 32 per cent for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in January of this year I announced the development of a national cardiovascular strategy aimed at achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  The proposals are built around three key initiatives as follows: the establishment of a national strategy to <Col N="1575" /> improve cardiovascular health; the provision of additional public cardiac surgery facilities for adults and children to tackle the backlog of patients awaiting surgery and to guarantee public hospital patients access to cardiac surgery within an average waiting period of six months of being placed on the waiting list; and the development of a heart-lung transplant programme for patients with cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases in the medium term.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists.  I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present.  Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG.  This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent.  I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to <Col N="1576" /> an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced a major package of investment in cardiac services totalling £4.9 million This investment is made up of two elements, £2.3 million to reduce waiting lists for cardiac surgery patients under the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and £2.6 million to meet the 1998 cost of improvements in cardiac care infrastructure to support the forthcoming cardiovascular health strategy outlined above.  These initiatives included an allocation of £787,500 in respect of additional cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology procedures at Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to the interim measures to reduce the public cardiac surgery waiting list, the 1998 initiative target is to provide appropriate treatment for an additional 265 adults and an additional 30 children.  My Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures in both the public and private sectors and the treatment of suitable patients with medical cardiac therapies.  I am confident that these measures will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the national cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>

      <P>Some tasks regularly undertaken by nurses are inappropriate to that category of staff outside their core nursing duties and can be effectively undertaken by other grades as the best use of available resources.  Many of these duties, such as portering and domestic tasks, have been identified as non-nursing duties.  The use of nurses for non-professional, non-therapeutic duties does not make optimal use of trained personnel and is not cost-effective.</P>
      <P>This issue has been addressed by the Commission on Nursing in its recently published report which states &ldquo;The interim report of the Commission had identified the concerns of many nurses and midwives at the number of non-nursing or midwifery tasks which they were required to perform.  It was suggested that the performance of such tasks did not make the best use of the professional nursing and midwifery workforce. The Commission supports this view and recommends that health service providers, nursing and midwifery management and nursing organisations examine opportunities for the increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of non-nursing tasks&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on the chief executive officer of each health agency to identify manpower requirements and to direct staffing resources to areas of priority while ensuring that the duties assigned to each grade of staff are appropriate to that grade. <Col N="1577" /> My Department will be holding discussions with all relevant parties on the implementation of the Commission on Nursing's recommendations on the performance of non-nursing duties by other personnel.  Decisions in relation to the qualifications and training of non-nursing personnel will also form part of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The total number of homeless according to the local authority homeless assessment carried out in March 1996 is 2,501.  This figure is regarded as a conservative estimate by organisations providing services for the homeless, but I am not in a position to comment on this.  The number of out of home young people is not included.  The nature and extent of the problem of homeless young people varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Because of the transient nature of the problem and the transient lifestyle of some young people it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless young people throughout Ireland.  However, it is recognised that the problem is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region.  On average 12 young people per night present to the social work service operating outside normal office hours and the Eastern Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year.  Asylum seekers are not categorised as homeless but are receiving assistance with accommodation.  Currently the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has over 6,000 applications for asylum on hands and the majority of these would be receiving assistance with accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards have responsibility for promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and for the provision of child care and family support services. <Col N="1580" /> The provision of suitable accommodation for children who are homeless is one of the services concerned.  In the period 1993 to 1997 an additional £43.5 million on an annualised basis was invested in the development of child care and family support services, including services for the young homeless.  Accommodation for homeless adults is normally provided by local authorities, although some health boards are involved, on behalf of the relevant local authority, in arranging emergency accommodation.  Many homeless adults have health related problems, such as those connected with drugs, AIDS, alcoholism or mental health and would be involved in programmes, provided by the health boards, targeted at these problems.  It is not possible to isolate the cost, applicable to homeless adults, of these services.</P>

      <P>I fully acknowledge the major commitment which carers make to supporting dependent people in their homes.  The responsibility of the health services in relation to carers lies in the provision of community support services and particularly respite care.  Since the Government has been in office, we have more than doubled the amount of capital funding available for services for older people which will allow additional respite and day care facilities to be put in place throughout the country.  The importance of the home help, paramedical and community nursing service as well as specific support for carers have been identified as priorities and it is my intention to make progress in these areas as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, gives powers to the health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes.  The Act also introduced a new system of nursing home subventions, so that dependent people most in need of nursing care would have access to such care.  The scheme is intended to assist persons in meeting <Col N="1581" /> the costs of nursing home care, but it is not intended to meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>I might add that since coming into office, the Government has provided additional resources to health boards to increase the number of nursing home subventions and to provide more assistance to people who are experiencing difficulties in covering their nursing homes fees.  The question of increasing the level of subvention will be considered in light of the availability of resources and other priorities in respect of the development of services for older people.</P>

However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week.  The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs.  A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment effective from 1 January 1997.  The first stage of the mechanism was introduced on 1 July 1995 and the complete four stage mechanism, to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation, has been in place since 1 January 1997. NCHDs are not required to work 48 hours without a break as this would be unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has considered the statement to which the Deputy refers.  The Review Group on <Col N="1582" /> Primary Childhood Immunisation, in its report produced in 1994, considered that the general practitioner was ideally placed to deliver this service and should be the principal health professional involved in its delivery.  Since 1996 the primary childhood immunisation programme has been administered through general practice. Under the agreement through which general practitioners contract to undertake childhood immunisations, they are required to take an appropriate patient history, provide pre-immunisation advice and information and examine the child.  The formal consent of the child's parent or guardian must also be obtained.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council's publication, A Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour and Fitness to Practise, indicates that every effort should be made by a doctor to ensure that a patient understands the nature and purpose of planned medical interventions.  The guide does not specify how or what information is to be given but rather places an onus on the doctor to ensure that the patient or, in the case of childhood immunisation, the parent or guardian, understands the issue.  The guide acknowledges that whether or not a patient is sufficiently informed to consent to medical treatment may be difficult to resolve.</P>
      <P>Immunisation of children is not compulsory and it is open to a parent who does not wish to have his or her child immunised, or who wishes to have time to consider the matter further, not to proceed with the immunisation.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's publication, Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland, contains detailed information for doctors on immunisation, contraindications to the administration of vaccines and their possible side-effects.  This booklet is currently being reviewed by the college's immunisation advisory committee.  My Department has produced an information leaflet which is widely available and contains information for parents on the importance of immunisation and how they can go about having their child immunised.</P>

      <P>The condition known as post polio syndrome or the late effects of polio &mdash; LEP &mdash; can strike up to 30 years after the person originally contracted polio.  It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of people who contracted polio in Ireland between the 1940's and the late 1960's &mdash; representing about 4,200 individuals &mdash; either have or will get the condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, <Col N="1583" /> 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he/she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for those who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1977, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. Additional funding of £100,000 was subsequently provided in May 1977 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew.  Total additional funding of £200,000 has been provided in this year's allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board to meet the full year cost of this enhanced service.

      <P>The current contract on offer to hospital consultants is effective from 1 January 1998 and was agreed following lengthy negotiations with the medical organisations.  Under the terms of the contract, hospital consultants sign an individual contract with hospitals or health boards and agree how the commitment is to be discharged, having regard to the nature of the service to be provided to the public hospital system.  Hospital consultants are engaged to provide at least 11 three hour <Col N="1587" /> sessions to the public hospital system each week and are also required to be on-call outside normal working hours to deal with emergencies as appropriate. Consultants are paid a basic salary together with additional payments for being on-call and also for being called out to deal with emergency cases.

      <P>Statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, London, indicate that 5,336 women resident in Ireland had legal abortions carried out in England and Wales in 1997.  The latest quarterly figures available are in respect of the quarter ended on 31 March 1998 and these indicate that 1,458 women resident in Ireland had legal abortions carried out in England and Wales.</P>

Other certificates relating for example to driving licences, insurance and assurance policies and certain certificates relating to social welfare schemes which are not included in the GMS contract would be subject to a fee by GPs.</P>

      <P>The provision of services at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  In line with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, the board is obliged to produce a service plan for <Col N="1589" /> the year based on the board's notified non-capital determination, which is £211,045 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>It is the board's responsibility to provide services within that allocation and to develop monthly expenditure plans and ongoing monitoring arrangements within that context.  I am aware from the South-Eastern Health Board that activity in the board's general hospitals, including Waterford Regional Hospital, for the first six months of this year is well up on the same period last year and that this is giving rise to budgetary concerns.  In line with the provision of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, however, it is a matter for the health board management to take whatever budgetary measures are required to ensure that net expenditure is contained within approved levels by the year end.</P>

      <P>Pay rates and employment conditions for the catering sector in the Dublin city/Dún Laoghaire area are being developed at present through negotiation between employer and worker representatives under the aegis of the Dublin city/Dún Laoghaire joint labour committee &mdash;&mdash; JLC.  It is envisaged that, upon completion of these negotiations &mdash; possibly by the end of 1998 &mdash; the Labour Court will confirm the agreed pay and conditions through the making of an ERO, thereby giving statutory effect in the Dublin city/Dún Laoghaire area to the pay/conditions negotiated in the JLC.</P>
      <P>The existing catering ERO is enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department and I am satisfied that enforcement, in due course, of a new ERO for the catering sector in Dublin city/Dún Laoghaire will not warrant any increase in staffing allocations to the inspectorate.  Accordingly, I have no plans to increase the inspectorate's current strength.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate, in its enforcement activity in relation to the existing catering ERO, carried out 632 inspections in the period 1 January to 30 September 1998.  In this period 100 breaches of the ERO in the matter of pay/holiday entitlements were identified, resulting in the collection of arrears due to affected workers of £35,565.  The comparable figures for the full year 1997 were &mdash; 1,014 inspections, 138 breaches identified and arrears collected of £66,090.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 April 1995, shortly after the notification of the proposed disallowances by the European Commission in respect of beef storage and multiple tendering, the Government established a group to examine the question of recoverability of the proposed disallowances.  The terms of reference required the group to examine all options of recoverability of disallowances with a view to having proposals ready for implementation when the final decision would be made by the Commission.  The group consisted of senior officials from the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Finance and the Office of Attorney General.  A senior counsel served as independent legal adviser to the group.  The then Attorney General, had ruled himself out of having any involvement with the group or with its findings, given that he had represented the Goodman Group at the Beef Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Following the formal disallowance decision in March 1996, the group reported to the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food.  The legal advice obtained by the group, and endorsed by it, was that the disallowances levied on Ireland did not of themselves give an entitlement to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to recover any part of the disallowances from companies which may have featured in the case made against Ireland by the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> The group examined the options of imposing a general levy on the beef industry or a levy on those companies against which there was evidence of wrong doing during the period &mdash; 1990-92 &mdash; in respect of which the disallowances were made.  It concluded that neither option would be legally sustainable.  This conclusion drew on a European Court judgment on an Italian case &mdash;&mdash; Frutticoltori &mdash; case C &mdash; 197/91 judgment 25/3/93 &mdash; which had rejected a proposal from the Italian Government to impose a levy on the fruit and vegetable industry following a disallowance imposed on Italy.  The other major option considered was for specific recoveries based on proven irregularities.  In this respect, the group concluded that any proceedings must be based on a recognised cause of action in Irish law and be proven in accordance with the applicable rules of evidence in civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>Arising from that principle, the group noted that proceedings had issued against AIBP for the recovery of damages in respect of irregularities found at AIBP Rathkeale.  Further proceedings were then in preparation for issue against AIBP in respect of irregularities at Shannon Meats. Both proceedings have yet to come to a court hearing.  Some £1.8 million is being sought in recoveries in respect of these cases.  Allegations had been presented to the Beef Tribunal about the non-declaration of de-boning yields which, under the Regulations, are the property of the Intervention Agency.  This matter has been the subject of a recent Government discussion arising out of which it was decided to serve summonses on AIBP.  These summonses were served on Tuesday afternoon.  As these proceedings are pending, I would not like to say anything which might prejudice their outcome.</P>

      <P>In the light of the outcome of the Supreme Court case in 1992, my Department requested the health boards to examine their records in an effort to establish the extent to which they contained information on the use of Trivax vaccine from batch 3741, which was the batch cited in the case.  The boards' records did not enable the extent of usage of the batch to be established at that time.  Information later obtained from the manufacturer indicates that the batch of this number was produced in 1968 and that it was dispensed into nine transit jars.  Three of these jars were not sold as Trivax.  The remaining six jars were filled into single and ten-dose containers for distribution in various countries, including Ireland and in the course of this various identifying lot numbers were assigned.  On receipt of the information in regard to these, my Department wrote to the health boards, asking them to re-examine their records in detail in an effort to ascertain the extent of use of these lot numbers during the 1968-70 period in the areas over which they have jurisdiction.  It must be recognised that immunisation records, where they exist for the period in question, may not be complete and that it may prove difficult, if not impossible, to identify the vaccine lot administered in any particular case.</P>
      <P>To date, responses have been received from the Mid-Western Health Board and in respect of part of the Western Health Board which indicate that vaccine from the lots in question was administered in 184 cases.  The records available to my Department at present indicate that only one of the applicants to the expert group which considered cases of alleged vaccine damage had received vaccine derived from the batch in question. This applicant was the individual in respect of whom the Supreme Court later found that the manufacturer of the Trivax vaccine was liable for his brain damage.  The Trivax batch in question had passed the mandatory tests carried out by virtue of the licence held under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  Information on the outcome of certain guidance testing conducted at the time was presented in the court during this case. The tests in question were undertaken in conjunction with the World Health Organisation for the purposes of developing better and more sensitive tests for the future.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure the availability of secure accommodation for a small <Col N="1595" /> number of very unmanageable children, I have given the Eastern Health Board approval to proceed with the development of the unit at St. Ita's, Portrane, referred to in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.

      <P>In the meantime, I was pleased to make a grant of £300,000 available to the Eastern Health Board to provide additional accommodation as a step down facility.  This is part of the development of an appropriate response to the needs of these children but it will also have the effect of freeing up more quickly beds within the two high support units.

      <P>All health boards provide drug prevention and treatment facilities, and, in addition grant aid organisations which provide such services to drug misusers.  The objectives of the health boards' response to the drug problem are based on two key elements: reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes; and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug free lifestyle.</P>
      <P>There is no exact figure for the number of drug abusers.  However, data from the Health Research Board's annual reports on treated drug misuse in Ireland gives a good indication of the extent of the problem.  The most recent figures available are for the years 1995 and 1996, which are as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> In addition to the above figures there would be a number of people abusing drugs who have never come into contact with treatment service providers.</P>
    <P>Services are generally provided to drug misusers on an out-patient basis.  The Eastern Health Board area, where the vast majority of opiate misusers reside has eight drug treatment centres and 21 satellite clinics.  In addition, over 100 general practitioners and 100 pharmacists are involved in providing methadone treatment to opiate misusers in their own local area.  There is a continuous demand for additional treatment facilities in the board and it continues to expand its services to meet this demand.  The number of treatment places in 1997 increased from 1,861 to 2,776, that is 915 new treatment places were provided in that period.  As services develop in local areas, however, more people come forward to access these services, so it is impossible to say when waiting lists can actually be eliminated. However, the board will continue to expand its services with the objective of providing prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare services to everyone who needs such services.  In other health boards drug misuse treatment is mainly provided by general practitioners or through hospital services.  The emphasis is on providing treatment in the person's own local area where support can be given by local counselling and community based agencies to the drug misuser and family members.  I am aware that some drug misusers are treated in facilities abroad. However, the contribution to be made by such facilities to dealing with the overall problem would not be significant.</P>
    <P>With regard to drug prevention, the health promotion unit in my Department implements a wide range of initiatives aimed at creating a greater awareness of the problems of drug misuse and preventing young people from turning to drug misuse in the first instance.  It has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science on the development and dissemination of a substance abuse prevention programme in schools.  It has also produced a mass media campaign, with the message &ldquo;drugs destroy lives, not just of users but people close to them too&rdquo;, a drug education video, a youth support work-pack, a community-based drug awareness programme, a leadership training programme for primary prevention of drug misuse, and a range of resource materials for parents, teachers, young people and those who work in the field of drug abuse prevention.  Regional health boards are also engaged in a wide variety of health promotion activities.</P>
    <P>In January this year the Taoiseach announced that the Government had decided on a programme for young people at risk.  A total sum of £30 million is being provided over the next three years to support the development of projects in disadvantaged areas and £20 million of this sum will be targeted at the areas worst affected by the heroin problem.</P>

This involves the provision of a wide range of health services, such as respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, Towards an Independent Future, co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been set up in each of the health boards. The voluntary agencies providing services in the sector are represented on these committees.  The priorities for the allocation of available additional funding for the development of services, including personal assistance services, are decided by the boards in consultation with the co-ordinating committees. This year £3 million has been provided for the development of these services.</P>

      <P>The current regulatory controls governing the sale and supply of medicinal products are set out in the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which replaced earlier regulations dating back to 1975.  These regulations, which reflect European Community requirements on the control of medicines, require that medicinal products placed on the market in Ireland, must be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board.  However, before the board will grant such an authorisation, it must first be satisfied that the product meets criteria laid down by the European Community to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.  The regulations, which are directed towards ensuring the health and safety of consumers, do not make any distinction between conventional pharmaceutical products and so-called alternative medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless and until a medicinal product is authorised in accordance with the regulations, neither the effectiveness nor mode of action of the product will have been established in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory framework, the primary objective of which is to ensure that all medicinal products which are made available <Col N="1598" /> to the public are demonstrably safe, efficacious and of good quality.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the procedures which are in place for the appointment of consultants for public hospitals.  Currently some public patients are experiencing long waiting times for in-patient procedures and, since coming into office, I have taken a series of measures aimed at reducing both waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists.  In January 1998, I allocated a total of £12 million for the waiting list initiative and this represented an increase of 50 per cent over the £8 million allocation made available by the previous Government for 1997.  The fact that this funding was allocated in January, rather than later in the year as heretofore, enabled hospitals and health boards to plan and implement waiting list work over the entire year.</P>
      <P>However, in order to reduce waiting times and waiting lists significantly and to maintain these at an appropriate level, it is necessary firstly to identify and then tackle their underlying causes. Towards this end, I have undertaken this first analysis of the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times by the establishment of a Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative whose report I received in August.  The contents of the report have been the subject of consultation and discussion by me and my Department with the Department of Finance in the context of the ongoing discussion on the Estimates for 1999.</P>

Under the regulations pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.  On receipt of notification the health board will arrange for an inspection of the service to be carried <Col N="1599" /> out by an authorised person.  It is estimated that there could be up to 5,000 facilities nationally.  The most recent information available from the health boards show that 2,563 notifications have been received and 808 inspections carried out.  A number of advisory visits and follow up visits have also taken place.  All inspections are due to be completed by the end of June 1999.</P>
      <P>Part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the introduction of a statutory scheme for the registration and inspection by health board's of children's residential centres operated by voluntary bodies.  The statutory obligations are set out in the Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996.  Information available from the health boards shows that the estimated number of facilities to be inspected is 42; the number inspected to date is 17 and the number registered is 11.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> You will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  Officials from this Department have been in regular contact with members of the Cystic Fibrosis Association and in particular with the association's chief executive, keeping them updated on progress in implementing this programme. It might, however, be useful for me to outline for you the various steps being taken to follow through on this commitment and ensure the introduction as soon as practicable of this new and highly complex service.</P>
    <P>An expert group was set up, comprising key personnel from the Mater and St Vincent's Hospitals, Dublin and officials from this Department to examine the existing level of service for Irish patients.</P>
    <P>The group has undertaken a detailed examination of heart-lung transplant services in the UK to establish whether the existing service can be improved in any way for Irish patients, while our own programme is being established.  The group has held discussions with four UK centres in recent months in this regard with a view to establishing a contractual arrangement with one of the centres for the treatment of Irish patients.  This work is at an advanced stage and I anticipate it will hopefully be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In terms of advancing the local arrangements required to establish an Irish based programme, I announced in recent months, as part of the launch of a National Strategy on Cardiovascular Health, that the Mater Hospital has been designated as the surgical site in Ireland for heart and lung transplants.  The Mater Hospital will provide this service, in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, which as you know is the major centre in Ireland for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  The Mater Hospital, at the Department's request, is co-ordinating and preparing a detailed examination of the infrastructural and service issues involved in developing the programme.  It is anticipated that a full submission will be available to the Department in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>A critical factor in the establishment of a successful programme in Ireland will be the training of the surgical, medical, nursing and support staff who will operate the unit.  It will be necessary to ensure that staff are equipped with the skills necessary to achieve results for the programme which are at least on a par with the best international standards.  It has been estimated that an initial training programme, linked with the UK, and lasting approximately two years will be required to ensure that staff are properly trained.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the establishment of a heart-lung transplant unit is being treated as a top priority and the importance attaching to the project has been emphasised to all parties involved.  My Department will continue to work with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and other interested groups in <Col N="1603" /> implementing the new heart-lung transplant programme.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 proposes a range of measures designed to improve the formation and training of drivers.

      <P>Many driving instructors are currently enrolled under the voluntary driver instructor register which is financially supported by my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation.  My Department has offered to provide additional financial assistance to the driver instructor register to enable it to attain an appropriate quality certification so as to further enhance confidence in it.</P>

      <P>No urban district council has been established since the foundation of the State, due in part to defects in the outdated <Col N="1604" /> legislation which applies.  The immediate legislative priority was to put in place the new local government funding system for 1999 and onwards.  The Local Government Act, 1998, enacted on 29 May, 1998, provides for this and other improvements.  I intend to bring forward further comprehensive legislation, which will modernise local government law generally, for publication to mark the centenary of local government.  Preparation of this legislation has commenced and it will, <i>inter alia</i>, contain a modern statutory framework for local authority structures. Any proposals for the establishment of new town authorities must be considered in the context of this legislation.</P>

This includes any matters relating to standards of accommodation, planning permission, registration of landlords, housing regulations and fire safety.  If, however a health board feels that a premises where a rent supplement is being paid is not up to an acceptable fire-safety standard, then the matter is brought to the attention of the local authority.</P>

      <P>Significant progress was made in the 1998 budget towards achieving and exceeding the target rates set by the commission.  The budget, in addition to providing for a general increase of £3 per week, provided for an increase of £5 per week for all pensioners.  As a result, payments to over 797,900 recipients (93.5 per cent) are about or above the minimum CSW rates and payments to a further 57,000 recipients (6.5 per cent) of supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance are still about 3 per cent below the target rate.</P>
      <P>The question of further increases in social welfare payments will be considered by Government in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to, the commitments contained in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

    <P>The figures relate to the year in which the application for reunification was made and not when status was granted.</P>
    <P>To obtain data on applications relating to persons who received status prior to 1996 would involve a disproportionate commitment of resources.  My Department has recently put in place arrangements which record the number of applications according to year on an ongoing basis for all persons with refugee status.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme is currently under review by my Department.  When the review is completed, which I expect will be towards the end of 1998, details of the revised schemes will be widely publicised and it will be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new schemes.  New application forms will be drawn up following the completion of the review.</P>
      <P>Details of the funding to be made available under the programme in 1999 will not be known until the Estimates are announced.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the third level student support schemes were extended, subject to certain exceptions, to include full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a <Col N="1608" /> university or third-level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU member state.  One of the exceptions is courses in colleges of further and higher education other than courses which are at Higher National Diploma level or higher.</P>
      <P>My Department has made inquiries in this case and I understand that the course referred to by the Deputy is not at Higher National Diploma level or higher and as such, does not come within the scope of the third level student support schemes.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science has assigned a representative to the education subcommittee of each area-based partnership under the Operational Programme 1994-99.</P>
      <P>I advised the Fatima task force in April of the name of my Department's representative in the case of the Canal Communities Partnership which includes the Fatima Mansions area in its remit.  I have also indicated to the task force that, while the particular departmental representative will not be available to it as a permanent member, he will be available to it for advice and consultation when its members are discussing educational matters. It is felt that this arrangement is adequate to keep the Department of Education and Science fully informed of the educational needs of the area.</P>
