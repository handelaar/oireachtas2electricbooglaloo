      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that it has been the practice for some time for the Government Chief Whip to issue, through the Government Information Services, at the start of each Dáil session, a press release setting out the Bills the Government proposes to publish in that session.  The press release also includes a list of all promised Government legislation.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is the practice for Ministers to issue, through their departmental press officers, press releases announcing proposals for legislation. When the text of a Bill is approved by Government it is usual for a press release on the Bill to issue through the Government Information Services.  These various press releases are augmented by media briefings and interviews by the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>Further public awareness of Bills as they pass through the Oireachtas is created by media coverage of the debates on the legislation.  These measures are in addition to the various constitutional and statutory requirements concerning legislation which must be complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the point made by the Deputy in his question and there is scope for improvement in how we, not just as a Government but as a Parliament, communicate to the public the legislative and other work we are doing.  To this end I have asked the Government Information Service, in conjunction with departmental press officers, to review arrangements for issuing information concerning legislation to ensure that it is disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that it is particularly targeted at those who are likely to be affected by it.  I also see a role for the Joint Committee on Broadcasting and Parliamentary Information in this matter and, as Chairman of that committee, I will raise the matter at its next meeting.  I look forward to the support and input of all sides of the House in putting in place the procedures and systems necessary to <Col N="3" /> ensure that the valuable legislative work of Parliament is communicated effectively to the public at large.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister of State agree that what happens here is largely unknown to the public and yet it has a vital bearing on the lives of people in terms of their rights and responsibilities?  For example as the Minister of State said, from the Government's list of promised legislation 22 Bills were enacted since the Government came into office, 11 more have been promised and yet there is a general lack of awareness from the point of view of the public.  Many people feel they have no stake in what is going on.  This is clear from the dwindling voting returns where the turnout for the by-elections in Limerick and Dublin was 50 per cent, the general election 62 per cent, the British-Irish Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty 60 per cent.  Given that four or five out of every ten people believe that what is happening here is of no relevance to them, there is need to address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised by Deputy Higgins are broader than merely communicating the message of what we do.  He has touched on something that is much more complex an issue, that is respect for parliament and what it does. From the point of view of legislation we have a legislation committee which is made up of senior officials &mdash; the Attorney General, people from the Draftspersons Office, my office, the Taoiseach's Office and so on &mdash; who meet on a weekly basis.  We try through that committee to give advance notice of the legislation coming through the system.  We are committed to ensuring, when it comes to future press releases that we become more accurate.  If legislation is unlikely to be available until l999 we will make sure that is stated clearly in the press release so that expectations are not heightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a Broadcasting and Parliamentary Information Committee.  The public relations officer of the House will report to that committee and has the job of communicating to the public details of the legislation we are planning to take. At our last meeting we discussed whether official notices might be placed in newspapers to list the legislation to be taken.  I am certain the public is aware of the major Bills that come before the House.  It is the smaller items which may not be so glamorous but which are important that may be overlooked.  I have in mind the plethora of directives from Brussels and other legislation which would never excite the public interest but nevertheless is important.  There may be a case for placing in the newspapers an official notice of the list of legislation to be taken and the legislation that has been passed.  The revamped Oireachtas committees will help a great deal in that area.  We now have committees that shadow <Col N="4" /> each Department and they give rise to more public knowledge about what is going on here.</P>

      <i>Note:</i> It should be noted that, overall, approximately 7 per cent of trade is unclassified by commodity.  The unclassified trade consists mainly of intra-EU estimates, including estimates for traders below the import survey threshold of £100,000.</P>
    <P>The figures show that in l992 imports of tobacco and tobacco products were valued at £46.1 million. Last year that figure had increased to £51 million, an 8 per cent increase in the value of those imports.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree we must do something to reduce the demand for tobacco which has a serious effect on the health of our nation?  Almost 20 per cent of hospital beds are now taken up by people suffering from tobacco related illnesses.  The tobacco industry spends large sums of money on advertising campaigns aimed at young people because their older customers are dying.  Does the Government have any plans to reduce the demand for tobacco?</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases awaiting an appeal hearing in his Department, as of 1 May 1998, for livestock schemes, REP schemes and other schemes; the approximate length of time to have an appeal heard; and the overall result of these appeals over the past 12 months up to 1 May 1998.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's headage and premia appeals unit deals with appeals against decisions under the arable aid, livestock, headage and premia schemes.  The unit holds an oral hearing if it is satisfied the case cannot be decided on the basis of the written evidence. The headage and premia appeals unit had 474 cases awaiting examination on 18 May 1998. The approximate length of time to have an appeal concluded is seven months.</P>
      <P>The total number of cases received over the past 12 months to May 1998 was 590 of which 387 were concluded.  They were dealt with as follows: successful &mdash; 26 per cent or 99 cases; unsuccessful &mdash; 63 per cent or 247 cases; and decisions revised by local office following receipt of appeal &mdash; 11 per cent or 41 cases.</P>
      <P>The number of cases awaiting a hearing by my Department's REPS appeals committee as at 1 May 1998 was 238.  Of these cases, 42 have since been heard by the committee.  The remaining cases are awaiting results of on-farm inspections. There is the minimum of delay in hearing the appeal once the inspection report has been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can take four to five months on average from <Col N="6" /> the date of formal receipt of the appeal to the hearing by the REPS appeals committee.  Over the past 12 months the appeals committee dealt with 190 cases.  The penalty was upheld in 93 cases and overturned or reduced in 97 cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that his Department is adopting a get tough policy.  I am not making a case for people who do not adhere to the rules but in regard to the genuine cases handled in the Department.  Am I correct in saying that the Minister recently removed the flexibility for compassion which can be shown by his experienced staff?  There is concern that, if farmers make the slightest mistake, they will be severely punished.  It is my understanding that a directive has been sent to livestock offices to the effect that such flexibility has been removed.</P>
      <P>In so far as appeals are concerned, does the Minister of State agree that there is something unfair about the system in that it is the Department which adjudicates on its own actions?  There is nothing independent about the appeals procedure. I am not saying there is anything wrong with the people involved but the public perception is that the Department judges itself and that those in farming are excluded from the appeals procedure.  That is seen as very unfair.  Furthermore, it is unjust that a decision on an appeal should take between six and 12 months.  There is something wrong with the system if that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that there should be a better appeals system.  Many problems arise from people not replying on time or because of a dispute over a case.  An oral hearing will take a little longer.  However, I accept appeals should not take as long as suggested by the Deputy.  Nonetheless, of the 1,079 cases which were appealed, 369 were decided in favour of the applicant.  That is a substantial number which reflects the appeals unit's openness to change where it is needed.</P>
      <P>The unit is governed by regulation and it must be carefully monitored in that it is not our money which is being dispensed.  The censure of the Commissioner or the Court of Auditors must be avoided to protect the Exchequer against disallowances of EU funds.  As the Deputy is aware from the time his party was in Government, the audit can be conducted in a haphazard fashion with files being chosen at random and, if there is something wrong with one of them, the Department and the taxpayer being fined by disallowance from certain funds.  We must exercise caution.</P>
      <P>Some people have flagrantly disobeyed the rules governing REPS, a scheme of benefit to farmers and which can improve the nature and atmosphere of the countryside.  It can also continue to give an additional income to farmers.  I want to see abuses ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff in the appeals unit are flexible and such instructions as the Deputy mentioned have <Col N="7" /> not been issued.  Any warnings given to people to correct matters are given on the basis of instructions issued by departmental planners.  In many cases, such corrections were not carried out but, in other cases, the high incidence of successful appeal cases &mdash; 361 out of 1,079 &mdash; shows the flexibility which exists in the unit.</P>

      <Quest>if he has considered in detail the provisions of the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992; if so, the mechanism, if any, he will put in place to adjudicate upon claims relating to vesting orders and dissolution of trusts, particularly in relation to cow parks which were formerly carried out by lay commissioners; if he will give an assurance that a tribunal will be set up to deal with these quasi-judicial matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992, provides in section 4 for the transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the continuing powers and functions of the Land Commission and of the lay commissioners. The Act further provides that the Minister for Agriculture and Food may exercise any of these powers and functions, including those referred to by the Deputy, or delegate their exercise to officers of the Department.</P>
      <P>Outline arrangements have already been made for the framework within which the transferred powers and functions, including the quasi-judicial functions of the lay commissioners, can be exercised within the Department when the Act is commenced.  I do not see the need for the setting up of a tribunal in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act was signed into law on 11 November 1992.  I wish to place on record my disapproval of the dissolution of the Land Commission and the failure to replace it with any other land agency.  We are reaping the whirlwind of the failure to do so.</P>
      <P>It has been almost six years since the passing of the Act, and I am aware there were legal interventions which I will not deal with in any detail. However, we should have introduced a land authority in place of the Land Commission.  This was warranted and is even more warranted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14.3 of the Land Commission Act gave the Minister power to bring the authority into operation on such a day as he appointed by order. The Minister says he has an outline proposal but is he still unsure of how to handle these matters? He may exercise all the powers and functions of the commissioners but does he intend that a civil <Col N="8" /> servant will preside in open court and hear objections and adjudicate on claims, on vesting orders and the dissolution of trusts as has been the practice with the Land Commission?  Will this be done behind closed doors or will the Minister set up a tribunal to deal with these matters.  These are quasi-judicial matters and have been dealt with as such.  It is important that we know the outline because farmers are asking this question.  What is the outline?  Who will look after these matters? Will it be someone such as a retired High Court judge?  Will hearings take place in an open forum?  What representation will people have? These are important questions, particularly as they relate to trusts, cow parks and such matters. They arise at local authority level and we need answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is exaggerating the quasi-judicial nature of the issue.  I dread to think that we will need another tribunal.  However, I appreciate his concern for the retired legal profession. In 1994, the Attorney General decided that it was proper to transfer powers to a civil servant, either at assistant principal or higher executive officer grade.  Civil servants will carry out the functions.  The Deputy will appreciate that all such matters are much more open these days.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the position in relation to the non-payment of headage, REP scheme and other grants to women who were farm owners and managers in their own right before they were married; the Department policy on farm women holding herd numbers separate to their husbands or partners; and his views on whether women should be allowed to farm in their own right and be eligible for the full range of grants if they meet the eligibility requirements laid down for all participants in schemes.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policies on equality are adhered to in all measures undertaken and all programmes, schemes and services of the Department of Agriculture and Food, including headage, REP scheme and TB and brucellosis eradication scheme grants.  These payments are equally available to men and women, thus ensuring that there is no discrimination on the grounds of gender.  The Department makes payments to all eligible applicants who comply with the terms and conditions governing the schemes regardless of their gender or marital status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where two or more applicants are associated, for example father-son or husband-wife-partner, the Department must be satisfied that their farming enterprises are operated as separate, individual economic units before grants can be paid. Where there is evidence that this is not the case they are treated as a joint application and their <Col N="9" /> herds as one herd for the purposes of payment of grants.  The EU Commission has indicated conditions and requirements with regard to the creation of new holdings in the context of premia payments.  Likewise, there is no sex discrimination in the allocation of herd numbers.  A father-son management team is required to meet the same criteria as a husband-wife-partner team when they propose to split an enterprise and create two separate units.  Women should have the same entitlement to grants and premia and the different programmes operated by the Department if they meet the eligibility requirements laid down for all other participants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is huge discrimination against farm women.  A fortnight ago an officer from the Department interviewed a husband whose wife was a farmer in her own right before she married.  She married a man who had a farm and they continued to run their businesses separately.  The official asked the husband if he helped his wife on her farm and if they shared machinery.  The next question could have been what did they say to each other in the bedroom.  It is outrageous. While the Minister may smile, the questions are contained in the document which has been issued by the Department to investigating staff.  Officials of other Departments would not ask a couple if they owned two guesthouses before they were married.  No one would ask them if they were helping each other and shared kitchen utensils. We have reached the stage where there is discrimination against farm women.  This must be viewed in a poor light.  I disagree with the Minister in that I regard it as blatant discrimination.</P>

      <P>There is no discrimination.  If an individual case is brought to my attention, I will have it examined.  Gender should play no part. Women are well able to farm in their own right and they should be assisted in every way possible. If they enter into an arrangement by partnership or marriage, this should have no bearing on their eligibility under the various schemes.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister is unaware of this problem as several cases have been brought to the attention of the Department. Couples are asked to submit tax returns dating back to 1992 to ascertain if the units are being managed separately or as a combined unit.  To obtain a herd number one has to meet three important requirements &mdash; one has to own or lease land, to own cattle and have proper handling facilities.  There must be no intermixing of stock.  Even those who meet all these conditions have had callers from the Department.  The Minister is sidestepping the issue.  Many women are of the view that they are not wanted in agriculture. That would be a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, if the Deputy says so.  Article 2.2 of Commission Regulation 3887/92 required member states to take the measures necessary to avoid the conversion of existing holdings or the creation of new holdings after 30 June 1992 as it leads to the improper avoidance of the provision relating to individual limits on eligibility for premia or set-aside requirements under the scheme.  I agree with the Deputy that once it is clear there is no intermixing of herds, there should be no difficulty.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate a table detailing grant assistance by county under the scheme of assistance for weather related crop losses in 1997 in the Official Report.  The scheme was introduced following an on-farm assessment by Teagasc of unharvestable crops and associated losses on some farms in the worst affected areas of the country.  The scheme was targeted at growers whose main source of income was from arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed, and whose crop losses seriously threatened the viability of their farms.  While fodder crops and other such losses did not come within the primary scope of the scheme, I am having these applications reassessed in the case of individual applicants who meet the general criteria of the scheme and who have incurred significant hardship</P>

      <P>I thought I would have got the list this morning setting out where the money was spent before this question came before us.  I am sure it will make interesting reading.  How much money was allocated to Wexford, Cork and other counties along the south coast?  I am disappointed I did not get the answer to my question.  I will have to wait until tomorrow to get that information which I should have now.</P>
      <P>A number of farmers in Mayo submitted applications under this scheme.  The second highest number of applications came from County Mayo. Those applicants received letters from the Minister last week stating they did not qualify for the scheme.  Has the Minister approached the Minister for Finance to seek extra funding?  Why were those farmers from County Mayo excluded from the scheme?  A farmer from County Mayo who is at the loss of £1,000 is comparable to a farmer from the south coast who is at the loss of £5,000.</P>

      <P>I do not have responsibility for giving out replies, but I understand they cannot be circulated until the end of Question Time.  If the Deputy wishes to check any aspect of this matter, I will be glad to let him have a copy of the tabular statement.  There is a problem with this scheme in that it does not provide for any allocation for crop damage or damage to farming enterprises as a result of bad weather.  All we can do is try to make savings in the Department and allocate a relatively small amount of money in that regard. Farming organisations should consider setting up some type of insurance operation to address this type of problem because inevitably every year there is flood damage, frost damage or damage caused by storms or something else.  We have to look for savings in the Department and such savings are inadequate to meet the various applications for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with the applications from Mayo is that those applicants did not suffer the same extent of damage to their arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed as that suffered by those in the grain producing areas of Wexford, Waterford and the southern part of the country and horticulture growers in north Dublin.  I asked my Department officials to re-examine all the cases involved, particularly those in the Bangor Erris area, to ascertain if hardship is demonstrated and where applicants come within the <Col N="12" /> general criteria of the scheme, we will see if we can help them out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Has all of the £1.3 million been allocated to applicants or is some of that money still in the Department?  Has the Minister approached the Minister for Finance to seek extra funding? Has he had meetings with his backbenchers on this because they have made many announcements to the effect that their constituents will be paid, but they have now had to pull back from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligible applicants who met the scheme criteria have been given an allocation from the £1.3 million.  That sum has not been fully exhausted, although it has been virtually exhausted. I have approached the Minister for Finance to seek additional funds as, I am sure, have many of my colleagues in relation to many shortfalls in their areas.  I have regular meetings, at least once a week at parliamentary party level, with my backbenchers.  If a backbencher from any party seeks a meeting with a Minister, I am sure the Minister is pleased to have a chat with them, as Ministers do on a fairly regular basis.  I hope the Department officials examining applications from farmers in the Deputy's constituency will be in a position to make recommendations shortly.  I also hope we will be able to find some resources to alleviate some of the hardship they have suffered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since July 1997 a salmonella control programme for pigs has <Col N="13" /> been in place in pig slaughter plants for which my Department has regulatory responsibility.  The programme is comprehensive and covers herd management and hygiene at all stages of production from the farm to slaughter and processing.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the greatest risk of salmonella poisoning arises from the handling of the product at the post retail stage.  It is thus essential that every precaution is taken to ensure proper cooking and to avoid cross contamination of all meats, including pig meat, at that stage.</P>
      <P>As regards the food poisoning outbreak referred to by the Deputy, investigations by the Eastern Health Board are continuing as to its cause.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that, from the consumers' view, the outbreak in Dundrum was extremely disturbing, particularly in view of the statement by the chief executive officer of the Food Safety Authority that somebody could have died as a result of it.  Can the Minister tell the House the extent of salmonella infection in pigs, the number of herds infected, the benefits or otherwise of the programme mentioned by him and whether it has made any difference to the incidence of infection?  In view of the dangers which exist, particularly as many in the retail sector are not conscious of the extent of salmonella infection in pigs, does the Minister acknowledge the need for a far greater effort in advising, informing and ensuring controls are in place at production and all other stages?  Will he inform the House of the improvements he intends to make in relation to work being done by the Department in advising farmers and producers?</P>

      <P>The control programme was put in place in 1997 and major progress has been made in this context.  I am not in a position to inform the Deputy of the number of herds infected, but it is a bare minimum or practically nil.  Given the procedures and controls in place, we are satisfied major progress has been made and that we compare favourably with our competitors in others EU member states.  The case in Dundrum referred to by the Deputy is still under investigation and I will be made aware of the results as soon as they are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the problem is practically non-existent while at the same time he is unable to say how many herds are infected by salmonella.  Most people will find this statement extraordinary and will not believe it because it is not based on facts.  How can the Minister make such a statement if he does not know the extent of the problem?  Will the Minister clarify precisely what he means by his statement? Have there been any preliminary findings regarding the extent of this problem which is of real concern to consumers and producers?  Some strains of salmonella are creating disease in pigs which has direct implications for producers.  I ask <Col N="14" /> the Minister to give a more comprehensive reply and to state exactly what he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated there is ongoing monitoring of all herds and testing at all points of slaughtering.  I do not have the number of infected herds available to me, but I understand it is a bare minimum.  Being in the export market we must be very vigilant.  The fears expressed by the Deputy are not real as we have to compete with countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries which are major exporters.  We must be on the ball and have a pure product.  The infection causing the problem is salmonella typhimurium.  The procedure at processing stage is that pigs from infected herds are the last to be slaughtered.  All herds, infected or otherwise, are being monitored on a regular basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify what exactly is meant by &lsquo;bare minimum&rsquo;?  More than 100 people were seriously affected by the salmonella outbreak in the Dublin area and there was a risk of death.  Nobody's fears are unfounded in this.  I would like the Minister to give a scientific explanation of what is meant by &lsquo;bare minimum&rsquo;.</P>

Although there was an isolated incident in Dublin, I understand there are no further difficulties.  We must be vigilant about this issue.  Sweden is now salmonella free and Denmark is heading in that direction.</P>

The new residues report on pig meat was one of the great success stories in the food industry in the past year.  Arising from various monitoring procedures, all residues have been more or less removed from pork.  I hope the new health authority will be in a position to announce that kind of information as it is what consumers want to hear.

The rates of payment vary depending on the size of holding and the stage of organic status reached.</P>
      <P>The annual additional rates are as follows: Applicants with more than three hectares of useable agricultural area would receive 150 ecus per hectare in conversion status for a maximum of 40 hectares and 75 ecus per hectare for full organic status for a maximum of 40 hectares.  Applicants farming up to three hectares with at least one hectare under fruit or vegetables would receive 200 ecus per hectare in conversion status up to a maximum of three hectares and 100 ecus per hectare for full organic status up to a maximum of three hectares.  To date, some £1.2 million has been paid to 348 farmers under the organic measure.  Funding is also available from my Department under a scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-9.  One of the measures under this scheme provides financial assistance to farmers, groups, companies or co-operatives for the provision of facilities for grading, packing, storing and distribution of organic produce.  Grant aid is at the rate of 50 per cent subject to a maximum investment of £70,000. Since 1994, £124,292 has been paid to 13 organic operators by my Department under this element of the scheme.  Further payments will be made under the scheme for the remainder of 1998 and for 1999.</P>
      <P>The measures have encouraged more farmers to convert to organic farming practices and assisted the marketing of organic produce.  It is likely the demand for organically produced food will continue to grow and I am confident that, with the supports available, our producers will be well placed to meet the increasing demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that every aid which can be given to organic farming should be given. The system appears to be working well with regard to livestock but the Minister of State might consider a system of financial aid for organic arable farming because organic farms are unable to provide sufficient winter feed, be it cereals or silage, for cattle.  This matter has probably been brought to the Minister of State's attention on more than one occasion.  Is it proposed to make a change in the system to redress that imbalance? The organic farmers are happy with the amount <Col N="16" /> of Exchequer aid in terms of headage payments but there is a problem in the arable sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a problem in that area.  We intend to propose establishing different structures in the next round of talks to correct the difficulties that have arisen in some of these areas.  We are aware that producers with small holdings, where payments per hectare would not be attractive, must be looked after.  These people are probably more ideally suited to practise organic farming than other, more intensive producers.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently considering a revised programme to deal with some of the problems, such as that outlined by the Deputy, and to bring them within the remit of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Some continental countries have extremely focused policies for organic farming which set targets of 10 per cent and 20 per cent of total land area to be used for organic production. An important aspect of those policies is research and development.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the levels of research and development available to Irish farmers who are interested in organic farming, particularly through Teagasc?  What proportion of Teagasc's budget is allocated for advisory purposes for people involved in organic farming?  What research projects have been undertaken and what conclusions, if any, can be drawn from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Organic farming is a relatively new industry in this country.  Only in recent years has it been taken seriously and organic produce has about 2 per cent of the market at present. However, the market has not been developed.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has been active in this area and runs an organic farm at Johnstown Castle.  A booklet has been produced by Teagasc in Johnstown Castle and it has been more than helpful to organic producers and to people starting in the organic sector.  There are difficulties in organising what is marketed as organic produce in some areas.  Less fertiliser does not mean a product is organic and there is a need to regulate that aspect of the market and to have the IOFGA stamp used more extensively.  There are only three inspectors in the country who are qualified to judge these products and more are necessary.  It is a matter of better organisation and better recognition for organic produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who is interested in organic production should contact Johnstown Castle in County Wexford.  The manager of that farm is most helpful and has produced a booklet on the subject which discusses profits and production in organic farming <i>vis-à-vis</i> commercial farming.  He shows that organic farming can be extremely successful financially.  The Deputy should contact Johnstown Castle for advice on embarking on organic farming. <Col N="17" /></P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements for REPS agreed at the agricultural structures committee of the EU Commission in April last, increased payments will be available in all natural heritage areas, special protection areas and all commonages. This compares with the original proposals submitted to the EU Commission which would have confined the compensation package to lands designated special areas of conservation, special protection areas and overgrazed commonages in designated DEDs.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who will benefit from the increased payments and the extension of these areas will be 15,000 compared with 6,000 under the original proposal.  The payment rates under the new package will be £80 per acre for the first 100 acres, £8 per acre between 101 and 200 acres and £6 per acre between 201 and 300 acres.  These rates represent an increase on the payment levels originally submitted of £77, £6 and £5 respectively for farmers with SAC areas and overgrazed commonages.</P>
      <P>The new payment rates will, however, be confined to the actual areas inside the designated zones with basic REPS payments of £50 per acre continuing to be made, to a maximum of 40 hectares, on other lands.  The EU Commission insisted that the increased payments could only be made on the actual acreage in the areas concerned but agreed that the measure could be extended to include NHAs and all commonages. This effectively increased the target area by some 370,000 acres with a consequent increase in planned expenditure of £30 million over the scheme confined to SACs, SPAs and designated overgrazed commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will mean, for the average existing REPS 80 acre farmer in an NHA, an increase in the annual payment from £4,960 to £6,400.  The maximum NHA payment increases from the current £6,200 per annum to £9,400.  The new arrangements also involve the following key adjustments: the abolition of the ten acre rule for commonage land; the extension of payments to farmers up to a new limit of 300 acres in the designated <Col N="18" /> areas; the introduction of a facility to move the boundaries of natural heritage areas where it is necessary to avoid anomalies and the substantial increase in social welfare allowances for REPS payments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the new arrangements will run for 15 years and will increase the overall value of REPS to £205 million per annum from the year 2000 with payments in 1998 amounting to £145 million, increasing to £178 million in 1999.  The payment levels agreed under the REPS package are based on the average costs of the additional restrictions and farming conditions which will apply in these areas.</P>
    <P>The increased payment rates will more than compensate farmers for any restrictions in these designated areas.  The new payments are also more beneficial to farmers as a result of the substantial increases in social welfare allowances negotiated to take account of the increased payments available to REPS farmers under the new package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>While the new payments will benefit farmers in commonage areas, the constituencies represented by me and by the Minister of State have areas of land, called callows, where farmers have small acreages.  Smallholders such as these, particularly in my constituency and in the west generally, will lose out under the scheme. Does the Minister of State intend to provide extra funding for these farmers?  They will be severely restricted by the regulations but will not get adequate compensation.  There are also implications for farmers who are not in the REP scheme.  There are benefits for farmers within the scheme but many farmers who are not prepared to participate in it will lose out as a result of these regulations.</P>
      <P>Has special consideration been given to farmers on the banks of the River Suck where up to 90 per cent of farms are included in NHAs and SACs?  These compensation payments are inadequate because the majority of farms are completely restricted.  Building slatted sheds and spreading slurry is restricted in these areas and the farmers' livelihoods are under threat.  Will the Minister consider further allocation of funding for compensation in these exceptional cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there may be some problems for some farmers.  However, I do not accept that farmers beside a river are restricted.  Last week silage effluent destroyed a number of miles of river.  Fisheries reports show that declining stock or kill off is an increasing problem in all areas.</P>
      <P>Eighty pounds an acre is a good starting income for the year.  The Deputy is talking about farmers in his constituency who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  The increase is huge and means the exemption of the first £2,000 from assessment.  A further 50 per cent of the balance of REPS payments is disregarded in the case of social welfare recipients.  Someone can receive</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> £3,500, which is equivalent to £70 per week, and still get social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>This increase will help smaller farmers, particularly in the areas to which the Deputy referred. Farming will be more environmentally friendly and stock produced will be more acceptable than under the requirements of commercial farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards SACs in callow areas, what will happen if the present weather continues throughout the summer?  Farmers are restricted to cutting hay in August.  If the rain persists they may not be able to get their hay and fodder for the winter.  Will the Minister guarantee additional compensation for those farmers?  A small number of acres are involved but it is vitally important for fodder reserves in the winter.  Does the Minister intend to reintroduce the control of farmyard pollution grant and if so, when?</P>

However, if such a disastrous situation arises the plight of small farmers will have to be looked at, particularly in SACs which are more restricted than others.  Fodder is an essential part of farming.  I do not see how these regulations will prevent farmers earning any income during the winter period.  I am more optimistic about the weather than Deputy Naughten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to give an answer tonight, if he does not have one now.  I acknowledge that the Minister's reply is factual.  However, if one was not up to date, one would almost believe it was good news for everybody. Surely the Minister has not forgotten the U-turn of his Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on the deal done on behalf of Irish farmers 12 months ago where people with bog in the SACs would be compensated for every acre they had outside it. There was not a word about that.  Those 6,000 farmers came out worst of all.  The Minister let them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That deal was agreed with farming organisations only 12 months ago but the Department did not push it through at European level.  There <Col N="20" /> are huge numbers of farmers in each county with turbary in SACs.  There are several hundred farmers in east County Galway who are at a serious financial loss because of the changes.  That pertains across the country, in small and big numbers, depending on the size of the turbary.  The Minister did not include that in his answer.  I hope he does not expect people to have forgotten about it.</P>

I recently came across a case where a planner did not even walk the farm but completed an application from a map at the kitchen table.  His insurance should be examined because that farmer has lost his grant.  That is why a planner has insurance and it should be looked at in that light.</P>
      <P>Professional planners should give professional advice.  It is difficult when a Departmental inspector finds that ditches which were removed six years ago are included in a map.  There are extraordinary cases where people have moved ditches and filled in ponds in the meantime.  The purpose of the payment is to ensure the preservation of natural habitat.  The attitude of the Department, particularly the inspectorate, is to try to be inclusive rather than exclusive.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made in having the ewe premium calculated with reference to the market price for sheep meat in Britain and Ireland rather than the present EU-wide basis which is totally irrelevant to market prices in Ireland</Quest>
      <QRef>[13469/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic sheep meat Regulation 3013/89 provides for the payment of a premium to bridge the gap between the average EU sheep meat price and a basic price for sheep meat.  This approach, based on the concept of a &ldquo;single income loss&rdquo; across the Community, replaced the regional system which was in force until 1992. The main reason for the change was the advent of the Single Market in 1992 involving the removal of borders between member states which <Col N="22" /> was expected to lead to a greater convergence of prices throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>This convergence has not taken place to the degree expected by the Commission and for this reason I have made a very strong case to have the ewe premium system re-examined.  So far the Commission has not agreed to reopen the method of calculation, but I am continuing to press the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to a re-examination of the method of calculation. It is essential that he continue to put pressure on the Commission to do so.  The Minister is well aware of the problems being experienced by the 10,700 or so farmers in receipt of the EU premium from his Department.  Under the extensification scheme, sheep are included in the livestock count for stocking rate density, but they are not eligible for payment under the scheme.  The EU cannot have its loaf and eat it.  It cannot impose an unworkable measure on sheep farmers. I acknowledge the difficulties being experienced by the Minister in this regard because, as one of the last variable premiums under the EU market support regime, there is bound to be resistance to it.  Does he agree a premium set in absolute terms would be more beneficial?  At present, as the price increases, the premium decreases and <i>vice versa,</i> but that does not benefit sheep farmers.  What steps is the Minister taking to deal with the problem?  Has he raised the matter at Council of Ministers level or secured support from British farmers and the British Minister for Agriculture?  Has he contacted the British Minister for Agriculture about the matter?  The ewe premium should be calculated with reference to the market prices for sheep meat in Britain and Ireland rather than on the EU-wide basis which was introduced under Regulation 3013/89 in 1992 because of the advent of the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of problems with the sheep industry generally.  Unfortunately, sheep meat is not considered in the Santer proposals for Agenda 2000.  In my submission I requested that sheep meat be included in new proposals and that some of the improvements the Deputy sought should be considered.  The proposed reduction in the price of beef and cereals is bound to affect the sheep meat industry.</P>
      <P>We are seeking a top-up of the ewe premium in any member state where the price reduces significantly. During the past three or four years we have had a price reduction relative to other member states.  While the premium increases when the price decreases, we have to operate within a basic EU-wide system which places us at a disadvantage. I have brought this to the attention of the Commission, Commissioner Fischler, his <i>cabinet</i> and to the Council of Ministers.  We are continuing to press that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also established a sheep meat forum to examine other aspects of the matter.  Question No. 31 on the Order Paper addresses the extensification <Col N="23" /> scheme, under which sheep are taken into account for stocking rate density but are not included in the payments.  That is a classic anomaly. I have asked the sheep meat forum to examine those matters and to adopt a concise policy decision.  Essentially, the sheep meat industry will have to improve its quality and its carcase classification, which was agreed at the last sheep meat forum.  The product will have to improve to deal with New Zealand imports.</P>
    <P>When pressed, the Commission suggested the introduction of a flat rate premium, but that would place us at a greater disadvantage.  Under the current system at least the premium increases if the price decreases.  A flat rate premium similar to the special beef premium, which the Commission suggested, would not suit Ireland.  We want to get the best possible deal for our 47,000 or so sheep farmers, most of whom farm in disadvantaged areas.  We want to ensure the industry is viable and that we get the best possible outcome from negotiations in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an age-old question about the balancing of the ewe premium.  The interests of sheep farmers might be best served under the Minister's proposals for the extensification scheme.  If sheep were included in the £80 Santer proposal, the increase for each ewe could be as high as £7 or £8.  I assume that is the line the Minister will take.  Will the new grading system the Minister proposes to introduce this year redress the anomaly whereby farmers in other countries seem to get a better price on the market?  Will it ensure a higher price for quality products?</P>

      <P>The new grading or classification system was agreed unanimously at the recent sheep meat forum and I hope it improves the position with regard to price.  In 1992 Irish prices were 74 per cent of the EU average, in 1993 they were 80 per cent, in 1994 they were 82 per cent, in 1995 they were 82 per cent, in 1996 they were 85 per cent and in 1997 they were 91 per cent. Our prices have been consistently lower than those in the EU.  My main concern, however, relates to the anomaly in the extensification scheme.  Sheep are taken into account for livestock units, but not included in payments under the scheme.  We want the scheme extended to include sheep and I will continue to press for that until we succeed.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Does the Minister of State agree this is a classic case of a project that should be grant aided?  The farmers concerned are very constrained in what they can do because of milk, beef and sheep quotas.  We are talking about diversification into a traditional area which had ceased to exist, seed potatoes, and a new area, the daffodil industry, which is neither natural nor generic to the area.  As small farmers are being enabled to stay on the land under the management of Moyvalley resources, everything possible should be done to encourage this enterprise. Unless it gets the necessary stimulation and encouragement by way of financial assistance, it is unlikely to be able to continue, much less develop.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of North Connaught Farmers and the Moyvalley Association in Crossmolina.  While we support this programme, we received £51 million worth of applications with only £16 million available.  The capacity for potato storage under the food subhead programme was met well in advance of that. The potato sector received far more money than it should have.  However, some other source of funding now available to the west might be looked at with a view to taking a share.</P>

The Minister should reconsider the matter.  He said he might be able to find the money in some other programme. It is worthy of support.  Mayo is a black spot and if any area deserves some employment, that county should receive it.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I am very sympathetic to this project which, I believe, offers a new chance to farmers in that area.  Unfortunately, only £16 million was available and applications totalled £51 million. The potato sector had already received more than its fair share of allocations but other funds may be used to help the project.  In particular, there is a new environment agenda being set up for many young farmers who are more experimental and more adventurous in what they are trying to do.  We will certainly do everything in our power to deal with the issue.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a requirement of Council Regulation 2079/92, under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is implemented, that a person eligible to become a farming transferee, must:</P>
      <P>(a) succeed the transferor/owner as the head of the agricultural holding which must be at least five hectares of utilisable agricultural area and subsequently expand the area of the holding by at least five hectares or 10 per cent, whichever is the greater, or;</P>
      <P>(b) hold either in full ownership or under lease, at least five hectares of agricultural land, which was not the subject of a transfer from the transferor/owner on or after 30 July 1992, and take over at least five hectares or 10 per cent of the land released by the transferor/owner, whichever is the greater, in order to expand the area of his/her holding.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this enlargement provision is a cause of concern among the various farming interests.  Accordingly, I have spoken with Commissioner Fischler in relation to the matter on a number of occasions.  In February this year I formally wrote to the Commissioner to express my concern in relation to this provision.  I requested that, in the context of a replacement measure, the enlargement requirement be dropped in favour of a viability criterion.</P>
      <P>I am glad to report that Commissioner Fischler responded positively to my request.  The new draft regulation on agriculture and rural development proposed by the Commission, which is currently being considered in the appropriate EU fora, replaces the enlargement provision with a viability criterion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I am glad the Commissioner has acceded to his request.  That was the most nonsensical provision ever implemented.  It was one of the problems that arose with a number of EU schemes <Col N="26" /> that have been introduced.  While I know that EU regulations have a direct effect and, for the most part, are directly applicable, nevertheless we should not accept all of them lock, stock and barrel because some are not suited to conditions here.  That was one such provision.  I am glad the Minister has been successful in &mdash; to use an agricultural term &mdash; eradicating it from the farm retirement scheme once and for all.</P>
      <P>EU regulation 2079/92 has a number of other horrendous anomalies.  One of them is that the income derived from and the time devoted to farming activities has to be at least 50 per cent in each case for each of the previous ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important question for farmers and I will persist with it.  At least 50 per cent of the time must be allocated.  In the application of this scheme, would the Minister deem it unfair if a person who was in receipt of a social welfare payment which was £600 over the limit for one particular year in the previous ten years was deemed to be ineligible?  Is it fair that he is thrown out of the scheme because of that? The matter should be looked at in terms of renegotiating regulation 2079/92.  Will the Minister consider advocating some change within his Department?  I know that his departmental officials are concerned about this matter and the Minister is aware of it.</P>
      <P>In the past two months I have met three farmers who have been catapulted out of the scheme because of this anomalous regulation which brings social welfare payments into play.  The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, spoke about excluding the first £2,000 of income.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that the same £2,000 criterion as the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, applied in relation to the REPS payments could be used in relation to any renegotiation of this income barrier, where money is derived from social welfare?  This is a social welfare case and obviously one has to be poor to qualify for receipt of social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm retirement scheme is a good one.  For many years we made attempts to introduce such schemes but none of them worked because of shortcomings.  This particular scheme works and it is being availed of by a sizeable number of people.  However, in the implementation of the scheme a number of shortcomings or anomalies have appeared.  One of those was the enlargement clause, which was absolutely ridiculous.  It was supposed to consolidate holdings but the real effect was to fragment them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>People were buying parcels of land in different parts of the country just for eligibility purposes.  In some cases they could ill afford to do that and it reduced the viability of the whole operation.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly was the off-farm income.  In many parts of the country, including the west, if there is any future at all it has to be in part-time farming.  I also put that matter to the Commissioner when I wrote to him formally.  I told him that all restrictions in regard to off-farm income should be deleted.  Those were the words I used.  I would expect and hope from the discussions with the Commissioner's <i>cabinet</i> that we will make progress in that particular regard as well.</P>
      <P>I expect that the current scheme will end at the end of this year, so there are only a few months left in it.  From 1 January 1999 we hope to have removed those irritants and anomalies from the scheme which, we expect, will then be far more attractive.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Fischler comes from Austria, a country which in many parts has a farming system quite similar to the west of Ireland.  The Commissioner has a deep appreciation of what is involved here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point Deputy Connaughton <Col N="28" /> has made.  We want to make a good scheme which is funded by the EU.  The philosophy of the scheme is to put farms and their management into the hands of younger people, give those who have not had a good cash flow during most of their lifetime a decent pension and to ensure the farming enterprise is viable.  If the farming enterprise is not viable and off farm income is available, it should maintain a family on a farm. That is the objective of our negotiating position.</P>

This service dates from the 1960s when it was decided that the service then being provided to breeders of pedigree Angus cattle in Ireland by a Scottish-based cattle breed society was inadequate.  The future development of the Irish Angus Cattle Society and the need for the service provided by my Department is currently being reviewed.

I understand the reasons help was given to many societies in the 1960s and early 1970s but is it not fair in 1998 that all societies should be treated in the same way given the Department's involvement?  When advertisements are placed in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and other farming papers when shows take place, the address used by the Irish Angus Cattle Society is that of the Department of Agriculture and Food.

The Department of Agriculture and Food has received a copy of the video in question and I condemn the scenes of cruelty depicted in it.</P>

      <P>My Department has been active at national and EU levels to improve the welfare of animals during transport.  This demonstrates that Ireland, in its own right, and the European Union are committed to the better care and welfare of animals over which they exercise jurisdiction during transport within the EU and to third countries, and have demonstrated this commitment by a range of measures introduced over recent years. Improving the care and welfare of livestock and other animals, whether for export or otherwise, is an ongoing process to which Ireland and the other member states of the EU are fully committed.</P>

      <P>Ireland takes great care of animals both domestically and in transporting them. Regulations introduced here in recent years adhere to the best EU animal welfare standards and surpass them in most cases.  I have received a good deal of representations to the effect that Ireland is overly restrictive in the standards and criteria laid down.  Cruelty to animals is unacceptable.  I had the opportunity to visit the Lebanon recently and raised this matter at the highest level.  Also officials from my Department raised the matter at official level in the Lebanon. On the question of the video, the best information available to me is that the animals filmed were not Irish.  However that is neither here nor there, as apparently animals were subjected to cruelty there.

      <P>I watched the video and I would like every other Deputy to watch it.  The cruelty displayed in it was outrageous.  It has been mentioned to me on more than one occasion that no Irish cattle were filmed in that video.  Are the conditions for transporting animals from Ireland the most strict in the world?</P>

      <P>Ireland adheres to all the EU standards and surpasses them in virtually all respects. The intention of the Irish industry is to have the product up to the highest standard.  One cannot have a high standard product if cruel techniques and practices are applied in the delivery of animals from the farm to the factory or the end use. We take the greatest care, ensuring there is adequate feed, water, ventilation and a transport facility that is conducive to the best possible animal welfare practices.  The information available to me is that the animal shown on the video was not Irish and Irish animals were not involved. Nonetheless as an adult community we do not wish to see cruelty in any case.</P>

      <Quest>if he will use his veto in the CAP reform negotiations to protect Irish drystock farmers from the totally unacceptable proposals for a 30 per cent cut in beef market supports.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's proposals for the reform of the beef regime were presented by Commissioner Fischler to the Agriculture Council at its meeting on 31 March l998.  At that meeting, I made it clear that the proposals, as presented, would have a seriously negative impact on Ireland and were, therefore, unacceptable.  I outlined the main areas where Irish agriculture would suffer as a result of the proposals and emphasised I could not accept a price reduction of 30 per cent without adequate compensation for producers and without adequate support arrangements for the market.  I reiterated my general opposition to these proposals at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 25-26 May l998.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on these proposals are at an early stage and I am confident that as they progress significant improvements can be achieved.  I am conscious of the concerns of drystock producers and will spare no effort in seeking to ensure they are taken into account in any final settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister's reply is a positive signal to the drystock producers, particularly those in the midlands.  Will he agree that livestock producers have the lowest income of all farm groups at about £100 per acre, according to Teagasc figures?  Given the way in which the proposals are framed, will he also agree that 65,000 farmers with 20 suckler cows or less, many of whom are based in the west, will receive only a £4 increase per cow and that continental farmers who factory farm bull beef would receive a premium of £176 per cow and a May sileage subsidy of £115 per acre?  Will he agree that the May sileage subsidy and the 1 per cent increase in the milk quota are a direct attack on Ireland's vital national interest?  Is he harnessing support at EU level to ensure the proposals, as formulated, are rejected and that our interests are safeguarded and protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied he will get sufficient support from his Cabinet colleagues, especially the Taoiseach?  There is a need for the Taoiseach to take an active role in the European Union to safeguard Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a proposal for a 30 per cent cut in institutional prices for beef.  Also there are a number of other factors in the Commission's proposals which would be detrimental to Irish farming and to beef farming.  We are seeking support from individual member states. We have bilateral meetings with virtually all member states and will continue to insist that our primary industry, the beef industry, is not negatively affected by these proposals.  The Taoiseach is in Lisbon today and will be in Cardiff at a meeting <Col N="33" /> of heads of Government later.  On each of those occasions he will raise this matter to ensure the best possible outcome.  These negotiations are at an early stage and will continue for the remainder of the year.  I have established consultation groups in beef and other areas to help make a case to me in the most comprehensive way possible.</P>

      <P>On the prevention of corruption Bill, which I understand is to be produced before the end of the year to allow ratification of EU and OECD conventions, will this legislation also modernise existing Irish law on corrupt payments which had its most recent enactment in 1916 in Westminster?  The principal legislation governing corrupt payments in Ireland dates back to 1889. We have not had a revision of legislation on corruption for more than 100 years.  Will this legislation be changed, particularly as affecting the burden of proof imposed on people who have made or received such payments?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j) that one has a particular political opinion or belief and the other does not ('the political opinion ground').&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In discussing this amendment, I will also discuss those relating to the trade union membership ground.  There was extensive discussion of this issue on Committee Stage and I reiterate the view I held then that these additional grounds should be included in the Bill, especially the political opinion ground in the context of the British-Irish Agreement.  Its inclusion would put us in line with Northern Ireland in terms of safeguarding people who might be discriminated against as regards employment because of their political opinions. There should be similar safeguards in legislation here, especially with the introduction of this Bill which it is hoped will safeguard people against discrimination in employment.  There should be no possibility of discrimination on the grounds of either political opinion or of trade union membership. I feel strongly about the trade union ground and there has been evidence recently that employees have been or might be discriminated against because they joined or wished to join a trade union.  Both are extremely important safeguards which should be included in any legislation which aims to guard against discrimination in places of employment or in the seeking of employment.  I propose that both amendments Nos. 1 and 2 should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important ground to be included in a Bill dealing with equality.  The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, 1971, which was updated and expanded in 1989, covers discrimination on the grounds of religious belief and political opinion.  It is important that such grounds be included in the legislation and I would like to hear the reasons for not including them. This issue is relevant, particularly in the current climate, the type of legislation marked in the British-Irish Agreement and the aspirations included in it in the context of treating people of different political opinions and aspirations with respect.  It is important, given the changing political landscape and the cross-Border bodies being established, that legislation ensures people cannot be discriminated against because of their political opinions.  It would be reassuring for many to see <Col N="41" /> it built into our legislation and it is the right way to go, particularly at this time.  Does the Minister of State expect to be able to include it in the legislation? Judging by the amendments tabled, it does not seem she is.  It is important it be included in legislation soon, given the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. One result of this Bill will be the definition of the areas in employment in which it will be illegal to discriminate.  The corollary is that the areas not included will be deemed to be legal for discrimination. Many employers may assume that, if something is not prohibited in this legislation, they may then be free to discriminate on those grounds.  My concern about trade union membership and political opinions is that circumstances could arise where discrimination could occur on those grounds and where the employee affected would not have redress under the Bill.</P>
      <P>A serious anomaly will be created in labour law.  Under dismissals legislation, it is illegal to dismiss someone on grounds of trade union membership or of political opinion.  Under this Bill, it will be legal to discriminate against someone in employment because they are a member of a trade union or because they hold a political opinion which does not find favour with their employer.  It is a serious omission to leave political opinion and trade union membership out of the legislation.  By so doing the Minister of State and the Government are signalling to employers that it will be legal and acceptable to discriminate against people on the grounds of trade union membership or political opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in exploring the options for extending the scope of the legislation along the lines proposed.  The amendments identify trade union membership and political opinion in addition to the nine discriminatory grounds already provided for and are some of the range of options for amendments which could be suggested.  Progress has been achieved on this difficult Bill because the scope, although broad, has remained focused.</P>
      <P>The focus in the Bill has been to give effect to the Government's commitment to enact legislation which would outlaw discrimination on the nine grounds in the Bill: sex, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  In giving effect to that commitment it has been necessary to consider each specific ground and legislate differently in respect of each, while at the same time securing progress towards a single, general, coherent, anti-discrimination Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The addition of new grounds would merit similar research and consultation.  Major issues would fall to be resolved before they could be dealt with in legislation.  I would be concerned about any delay which such preparatory work would entail. Decisions would fall to be taken on a range of complex issues such as: the limits on political <Col N="42" /> activity in some branches of the public service, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána; the extent and nature of exclusions to cater for existing legitimate practices which often operate on a party political basis and the questions relating to trade union membership and freedom of association. Accordingly, I regard the principles for change to the Bill contained in these amendments as matters for another time.  Deputies will be aware from the complexity of the Bill that additions to its scope would involve considerably more drafting work and policy development than the simple amendment of section 6.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the principle in the amendments but I cannot accept them at this stage because we have been trying to proceed with this anti-discrimination measure for a long time.  I do not think I could introduce new grounds at the eleventh hour.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(c) the work is exclusively or mainly performed by persons of the same gender, and where there is no comparator within the meaning of <i>subsection (3)(a)</i> of this section the position of a comparator within the meaning of <i>subsection (3)(a)</i> of this section shall be replaced by a notional comparator,</P>
      <P>(d) a notional comparator shall be a person employed in work of a similar nature to that done by the primary worker and any differences between the work performed and conditions under which it is performed by the primary worker and the notional comparator are of small importance in relation to the work as a whole, or, occur with such irregularity as not to be significant,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been discussed since the beginning of the debate on this Bill in this House and in the Seanad.  It seeks to include the concept of a notional comparator in the legislation.  This would mean that people on low pay who do not have a similar group of the other gender with whom to compare themselves, would be able to have their remuneration considered in the context of comparisons with similar work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that minimum wage legislation will <Col N="43" /> assist in this area.  I hope, we will have such legislation in the near future.  Opposition Members and the Minister of State wish to include the concept of a notional comparator in the Bill.  It seeks to protect workers on low pay who cannot compare their work.  Primarily, these are female workers engaged in work which has no male comparison wage level up to which they can bring their pay.  This is an important concept and I hope the Minister of State can include it in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment addresses the notion of having someone with whom one can compare one's work in equal pay cases or when seeking pay increases.  We have had difficulty including this concept in legislation as it is a complex issue.  It has been discussed over many years in the context of employment equality legislation. This arises because, traditionally, women have often been grouped in low paid employment and because there is a difficulty in obtaining a comparator for tackling discrimination in the areas in question.  I hope this will be less of a problem as the economy improves.  Legislation on a minimum wage and the range of initiatives to tackle low pay will begin to take effect.  However, low pay is still a reality as highlighted by reports from the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to how work in low paid sectors where women predominate can be compared for the purposes of eliminating discrimination. It is difficult to develop a model for this but it is equally obvious that this needs attention. Despite equal pay and opportunities, women predominate in low paid employment.  They are and will increasingly become atypical employees as the labour market changes.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report by the Employment Equality Agency these workers are mostly employed in three sectors: services, clerical and a narrow range of professions.  There have been some dramatic changes which receive a lot of media attention.  However, sometimes these changes highlight the lack of earning power of many women and the low income of many others. This is why it is important to include this amendment.</P>
      <P>The two sections are intended to address this issue and develop a method of comparison so that these matters can be tackled where there is discrimination in low paid sectors.  Over many years the Employment Equality agency has found that there is a problem because of the lack of a comparator. The Minister of State should accept these amendments in order to deal with this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is prompted by Deputies' concerns on low pay.  Low pay is a different matter and needs to be addressed in separate legislation.  So far as is possible in this legislation, I have expanded rights to equal pay.  For example, the place requirement restriction which existed in the previous legislation is deleted from <Col N="44" /> this Bill.  I am also providing that a comparison can be made with the previous incumbent of a job and not necessarily with a person who is currently employed.  I am also giving new powers to the Equality Authority to develop statutory codes of practice which may be harnessed to strengthen the movement towards equal pay.</P>
      <P>The European Commission published a code of practice on equal pay in 1996.  The code aims to provide concrete advice for employers and trade unionists to ensure that the principle of equality between women and men performing work of equal value is applied in all aspects of pay. Developing a suitable national code of practice on equal pay which could be given statutory basis under the Bill can be discussed with the Equality Authority when it is in place.  I draw Deputies' attention to the new powers of the authority to carry out equality reviews and action plans.  These powers provide the potential to examine pay practices in organisations with a view to eliminating inequalities based on discriminatory assumptions or practices.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, it proved impossible to develop a viable model for a hypothetical comparator to achieve the intended results.  We have reluctantly come to conclusions about the viability of a statutory-based approach so far as the Bill is concerned.  Interest in the concept was grounded in the search for a means for tackling the vertical and horizontal segregation of the labour market.  We hope what is contained in the Bill will be of support.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes as a key priority the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage.  To give effect to that commitment, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment established a national minimum wage commission to examine the issue.  The commission published its report, which has been widely circulated, in April.  I understand the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will, in the coming months, have extensive consultations with the social partners and other interested parties on the issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between the lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) In considering the reasonableness of the refusal or failure of an employer to provide for special treatment or facilities to which <i>paragraph (a)</i> relates, regard shall be had to all grants, special services, facilities, assistance and <Col N="45" /> tax incentives available to that employer in respect of such provision.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment.  It deals with the rights of people with disabilities and arises from the decision of the Supreme Court that the original legislation was not in compliance with the Constitution.  I am concerned at the use of the concept of nominal cost in arranging the workplace so that a person with a disability can be employed.  While the amendment brought forward by the Minister of State on Committee Stage improved matters, I am still unhappy that employers are only asked to incur nominal costs in employing a person with a disability.  It was my hope the legislation would safeguard the rights of people with disabilities in terms of access to employment in light of the fact that approximately 80 per cent of people with disabilities in the so-called Celtic tiger economy are unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that employers make a reasonable effort to alter the workplace in such a way that a person with a disability can be employed.  According to information we have received from the United States, in the vast majority of cases the cost is not great.  There are advantages.  If the workplace is adapted it becomes easier to employ more than one person with a disability.  The legislation should not create obstacles for people with disabilities, rather it should be inclusive and provide protection.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment employers would have to have regard to all grants, special services, facilities, assistance and tax incentives available from the State to employ a person with a disability.  In the vast majority of cases no additional costs will be incurred.  I am seeking to ensure any loopholes are closed off.  If this safeguard is not provided, I fear the legislation will have a negative rather than a positive effect on people with disabilities. There is general agreement that if we cannot safeguard the rights of people with disabilities, we may have to look at proposals to amend the Constitution. I therefore urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the changes the Minister of State has made to the Bill which is much improved as a result.  Following the Supreme Court judgment she had a difficult task to devise legislation that would be within the terms of the judgment and at the same time provide optimum support for the disabled.  On the amendment, we want to make explicit what the Minister of State says is implicit in the Bill so that employers will be in no doubt that, when it comes to the assessment of costs, grants and State supports may not be included.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the reasonableness of the refusal or failure of an employer to provide for special treatment or facilities to which paragraph (a) relates, regard shall be had to all grants, special services, facilities, assistance and <Col N="46" /> tax incentives available to that employer in respect of such provision.</P>
    <P>None of the grants and facilities available in making adaptations for the disabled is on a statutory basis.  We will begin to do this if the amendment is accepted.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to consider it seriously.</P>
    <P>There are huge attitudinal problems about employing people with disabilities among whom there is a high rate of unemployment.  We must do whatever we can in legislation to be pro-active in tackling discrimination and removing the barriers which remain.  Since strong disability legislation was introduced in the United States more than 800,000 people with severe disabilities have entered the workforce, an increase of 27 per cent. Generally, the costs involved were not high, under $500 in most cases.  It is a question of allaying the fears of employers and making sure the grants available are availed of.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment about which I feel strongly.  It would make what is implicit in the Bill explicit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and ask the Minister of State to accept it.  I do not believe there are any grounds for not accepting this amendment.  It simply seeks to have considered, in the assessment the reasonableness of the refusal or failure of an employer to provide for special treatment, any grants, State assistance, subsidies and so on which are available to that employer.  It is difficult to conceive of a situation where those circumstances would not be taken into account.  The legislation should be clear on that.  There is an important reason for it.  We know the set of circumstances we inherited as a result of the Supreme Court decision in regard to this legislation, on the imposition of costs and so on.  We have to accept that in regard to the constitutional parameters in which we operate.  However, a distinction must be made between the case of employers where there are significant costs involved in employing a person with a disability and employers who do not bother to find out what assistance may be available.  If they were to go to that trouble, they might find there is no additional cost or that the cost involved is negligible. It is important the legislation provides for that distinction.</P>
      <P>Because the legislation provides for taking into account the grants which are available and so on, there are no grounds for the Minister to continue to refuse to accept this amendment.  I understand the caution she expressed on Committee Stage about the constitutional parameters within which she must operate, given the Supreme Court decision, but I cannot see how this amendment could in any way conceivably impact or infringe on the decision of the Supreme Court on the earlier Bill.  I ask the Minister, at this late stage, to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>Section 16(3) was amended <Col N="47" /> on Committee Stage to state in clear terms an employer's obligations in relation to the provision of special treatment or facilities for a person with a disability.  The Bill provides that an employer must make reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability, if that person would be capable of doing the job effectively with the assistance of special treatment or facilities, unless the provision of those special treatment or facilities would give rise to a cost other than a nominal cost to the employer.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment seeks to amend section 16(3) by the introduction of a new paragraph (d) which provides that in considering the reasonableness of the refusal or failure to provide special treatment or facilities, regard should be had to all grants, special services, facilities, assistance and tax incentives available to the employer. It is implicit in section 16(3) that in determining whether the provision of a special treatment or facilities gives rise to a cost to an employer, State supports available to the employer will be taken into account.  It is implicit too that other supports from, perhaps, voluntary services, also fall to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Deputies can be assured we considered this matter in great detail.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, it is not appropriate in the context of an anti-discrimination measure, such as this Bill, to put on a statutory basis requirements relating to the whole gambit of State aid.  Such arrangements might well be established in a positive action measure for people with disabilities generally and not only for those who come within the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I listened to what the Deputies said, in particular, Deputy Fitzgerald's reference to the American disabilities Act.  However, Deputies should bear in mind this is not a disabilities Bill or a positive action type Bill.  It relates to people with disabilities and to eight other grounds of discrimination. This Bill deals with anti-discrimination, but the forthcoming disabilities Bill will have to take account of the proposals and suggestions submitted on positive action type measures.  This is not a positive action Bill, but an anti-discrimination one.  We all want to see legislation on the Statute Book covering nine grounds of discrimination. I also want to see legislation covering discrimination on the ground of disability, but I do not want to take any risk with this legislation.</P>
      <P>We trawled through it and I thank Members for their comments on the positive improvements we made to it.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, it is much improved since we dealt with it in the Seanad.  Members will appreciate we had a difficult task, but it was not for want of trying that we have tried to push this Bill to the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised a concern.  It is important to point out that if employees are not happy with how they have been treated by their employers, they can appeal their cases to the Director of Equality Investigations.  This Bill is <Col N="48" /> not a positive action type measure like the American disabilities Act.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Gilmore is concerned that employers might not bother to accommodate an employee with a disability.  However, if I had a disability and my employer did not bother to accommodate me, I would bring a case to the Director of Equality Investigations.  I would have a case because it is up to the employer to take into consideration all the supports available.  We are not talking about the cost of adaptation, but the nominal cost to the employer.  The cost of adaptation is covered by the grants and supports available and it will not impose a cost on the employer.  That is an important point.  We must ensure that people realise that when this Bill is enacted, employers will only be able to fight their case before the Director of Equality of Investigations if the cost involved is a cost on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was concerned about the legal advice we have on this matter, our advice is that the provision contained in the Bill, which takes account of the changes in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, would be constitutionally viable, but there are concerns about proceeding further.  We have made allowance for the retention of the disability ground in the Bill despite what happened in the Supreme Court in the past.  There is no further room for manoeuvre here.  The Supreme Court judgment on the 1996 Bill was critical of the requirement of an employer to disclose his or her financial circumstances to an outside party in order to claim undue hardship.  We are concerned that the suggested amendment, which refers to tax concessions, could be open to a similar criticism.  It is a question of how far one can push the boat out before one goes across the line.  We have trawled the legislation and we are certain we are at the line.  I do not believe anyone, particularly the 360,000 people with disabilities, want us to pass another Bill that may be unconstitutional.  We are at the line on this legislation and we can go no further.  The message must go out clearly to employers that an employee with a disability can bring them before the Director of Equality Investigations if they have not taken into consideration the various supports available.  The Bill only protects employers in terms of a cost on them, it does not cover the cost of adaptation.</P>

      <P>I wish to pursue one aspect of this matter.  I am concerned that if an employee brings a case against an employer to the Director of Equality Investigations, the employer will be able to say that he or she is not obliged under the legislation to apply for a grant and, therefore, has decided not to apply for one.  He or she could use the legalisation to say there is no definite obligation on them to apply for whatever grants are available.  In that situation an employer might win the case against the person taking it.  I accept the point made by the Minister that this is not positive action legislation but rather sets out to protect against discrimination.  However, the legislation <Col N="49" /> deals with employment and an employer could take the interpretation that there is no absolute obligation on him or her to apply for available grants to make the workplace adaptable for a person with a disability.  I am not satisfied that the loophole is fully catered for in the existing provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is important this matter is thrashed out in a clear manner.  The legislation is an anti-discrimination measure.  The primary obligation it places on employers is not to discriminate against a person on the grounds of disability or one of the other eight grounds under section 6 of the Bill.  It is important that persons seeking redress under the Bill, on the grounds of disability or one of the other grounds, must show they have been afforded treatment less favourable than that which is, has or would be afforded another person on one of the discriminatory grounds.  In considering a case of discrimination on the grounds of disability, the Bill establishes the right of a person with a disability to be placed on a level playing field with the comparator by being given special treatment and facilities.  Once account has been taken of this obligation it is a matter for the employer to select, on the grounds <Col N="50" /> of merit and suitability, between the number of competent and capable candidates available to her.  I hope this clarifies the anti-discrimination provisions in the context of employment.</P>

      <P>If the Bill stands as it is, and the amendment is not accepted, what pressure is there on employers to use whatever grants, facilities, tax incentives, etc., are available?  Is there any statutory pressure?  Is the Minister satisfied that such grants, etc., will be availed of?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) It is immaterial for the purposes of this section whether A and B are of the same gender.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that where sexual harassment takes place, it is immaterial whether the people concerned are of the same or different genders.  It seeks to ensure that nobody is unprotected with regard to sexual harassment. If sexual harassment is perpetrated by a person of the same sex, the person should not be excluded from the remit of the Bill.  It is a fact that sexual harassment can be carried out by a person on a person of the same gender and such harassment should be covered by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment should be accepted.  There is evidence that the sexual harassment described by Deputy O'Sullivan is a reality and it is important that the legislation covers same sex sexual harassment.  Can the Minister of State clarify if this issue is already covered in other sections of the Bill under one of the other grounds?  The amendment is an attempt to make it explicit that the Bill covers this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 seek to extend the definition of sexual harassment to same sex sexual harassment.  As I said on Committee Stage, there are aspects of harassment and bullying which do not come within the scope of the nine grounds in the Bill.  I am determined to focus on outlawing discrimination on the nine grounds rather than broadening the scope of the Bill to new issues, however worthy they might be.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill transposes into Irish law the European equal pay and equal treatment directives. The foundation of these directives is the notion of a comparator of the opposite sex.  I had the issue examined following the Committee Stage debate and there is no reason to deviate from the policy in this regard.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>Same sex sexual harassment is seldom simply a matter of discrimination on the ground of sex.  It is often based on, for example, age, sexual orientation or on family or marital status.  Harassment on these grounds are covered in section 32.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 27, to delete lines 8 to 13.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the height requirement for recruits to the Garda Síochána.  On Committee Stage we debated whether it was appropriate to have such a requirement and I do not intend to repeat those arguments.  The Minister of State indicated that the issue might be addressed in other legislation.  Can she indicate if there is a willingness on the part of the Government or her Department to reconsider this issue in other legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of height requirements in respect of recruitment to the <Col N="53" /> Garda Síochána and the Prison Service arises from the particular nature of those employments. Without the exclusion, the application of a single height requirement could be indirectly discriminatory because it would impact disproportionately on one sex, women.  The Bill seeks to avoid this situation by allowing the application of height requirements but in such a manner that approximately the same proportion of men and women are likely to meet the criterion for the respective sexes.  This is the only aspect of this issue that we can and are addressing in the Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the primary roles of the Garda Síochána is the prevention of crime.  To fulfil such a role there is a requirement for a physical presence of uniformed gardaí on patrol.  From a psychological, as well as a practical perspective, there are distinct benefits in recruiting a force that is taller on average than the population generally. Similarly, the primary role of the prison officer is to maintain control of prisoners and to fulfil such a role a physical presence is essential.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's concern but this matter should, if it must, be raised on another day.  This Bill deals with the anti-discimination aspect of the height requirement in the context I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 33, to delete lines 36 to 40.</P>
      <P>These are important amendments.  The Bill purports to make discrimination on the ground of age illegal.  The subsections of section 34 open enormous loopholes which will mean that, in practice, discrimination on the age ground in employment will still be permitted and will remain commonplace.  There are two escape clauses from the provisions regarding discrimination on the ground of age.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 relates to subsection (3) under which an employer, if he shows there is clear actuarial or other evidence that significantly increased costs would result if the discrimination were not permitted, is allowed to discriminate on the age ground.  Actuarial costs means that if an employer says it will cost more to include someone older in a pension scheme, they are allowed discriminate against that person.  If someone aged 45 or 50 years applies for a job, it will cost more to include them than someone who is 25 or 30 years old.  Similarly there are circumstances where other costs, for example, relating to pay or pay expectations, can be used to discriminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 34 (5), to which amendment No. 10 relates, allows an employer to state a maximum age for recruitment to a job where the cost of, or the period of time involved in, training is taken into account or where it is considered that the <Col N="54" /> employee has to be in employment for what is called a reasonable period of time prior to retirement age, which is not defined.  If someone aged 50 years applies for a job and the employer says it will take a while to train them or it will cost some money, that person can be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The old type of employment regime where somebody went into a job in their early or mid twenties, stayed in it for 40 years, retired at 65 years &mdash; very often from the same job and employer &mdash; no longer exists.  We live in a world where we are constantly told that change is the norm in economic life and where people throughout their working life must be prepared to change not only their employer but perhaps their job and career several times.  We are also living in an age where the hours of and arrangements for work are becoming more atypical.</P>
    <P>People in older age brackets are discriminated against in this world of work.  The new industries which are part and parcel of the Celtic tiger are fine for those in their twenties and thirties who have recently completed their education.  They want to recruit young, newly qualified graduates. However, many of these industries regard those aged 50 years and over as past it.  For example, those made redundant at 45, 50 or 55 years are moving out of employment and find it increasingly hard to get back into it because employers are discriminating against them.  This Bill will rightly make it illegal for an employer to say that no women or travellers need apply.  However, it does not make it illegal for an employer to effectively say that no middle aged person or anyone over 50 or 55 need apply.</P>
    <P>There is serious discrimination in this area at the moment.  Increasing numbers of people in our community are not being allowed to participate in the workforce.  Employers in the new type of economy regard older people as past it.  We need to make a stand on this.  We are enacting legislation which purports to make discrimination illegal in the workplace.  It should also be clear that it makes discrimination on grounds of age illegal.</P>
    <P>This legislation should not provide loopholes where an employer can say it will cost too much to include someone in a pension scheme or that it will cost too much or take too long to train or retrain someone for a job.  That is a recipe for discrimination against older and middle aged people in the workplace.  It needs to be addressed and the loopholes in this Bill need to be removed so that all employers are clear that it will be as illegal to discriminate on grounds of age as it is to discriminate on grounds of gender or on any other grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore.  A great number of people aged 50 years or more have difficulty in gaining employment.  Many men who left school at 15, 16 or 17 years old a number of years ago have been made redundant because the nature of the workplace and the skills <Col N="55" /> required have changed so much.  They have a great deal to contribute to the economy and want to be employed.  It is important that employment equality legislation ensures that people like that have access to the workplace and are not discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Deputy Gilmore. He highlighted the fact that ageism is real in our society.  It needs to be tackled and we need strong legislation to do so.  It is particularly relevant in a changing marketplace where people move between different jobs over a lifetime.  It is important that they are protected.  There is a skills shortage in some sectors which is creating opportunities for people who perhaps traditionally would have retired.  This amendment seeks to give ongoing protection to older people.  Age should not be a barrier to getting protection from our employment legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 seeks to delete section 34(3).  This subsection excludes from the discriminatory provision of the Bill discrimination on the age and disability ground where it is justified on the basis of costs.  In order to avail of this exclusion, an employer must show there is a clear actuarial or other similarly based evidence to indicate he or she would incur significant increased costs in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>While the Bill does not deal with pensions where actuarial factors are particularly relevant, it covers death in service or permanent health measures where actuarial evidence arises, especially in the context of age and health characteristics.  In the event that a person feels that he or she has been discriminated against in such circumstances, that person can bring a case to the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
      <P>The employer will be obliged to produce appropriate evidence to justify any discriminatory action on his or her part.  This evidence which may ultimately be examined in the context of an equality case under the Bill must be such as to satisfy the statutory independent director that the discrimination in question is justifiable in accordance with this subsection.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 10, in legislation for employment equality on any ground a balance must be maintained between the interests of employees and the viability of enterprise.  In the case of applying age anti-discrimination legislation in the labour market, it is essential to have regard to existing labour market practices which facilitate a natural throughput of workers from school leaving age to retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill prohibits discrimination against employees or prospective employees in the age range of 18 to 65 years.  Section 34(5) allows an employer to set a maximum recruitment age in certain circumstances.  In setting maximum <Col N="56" /> recruitment ages, an employer must, in accordance with the subsection, take account of the time and cost of training an employee and the need to ensure a reasonable period of effective service prior to retirement age.  These exclusions are dictated by the need to ensure this legislation does not upset economically sensitive recruitment decisions with consequential implications for the operation of the labour market to which I alluded earlier.  Any maximum recruitment age set by an employer can, in the context of an equality case under the Bill, be examined by the Director of Equality Investigations to ensure the age limit set meets the criteria established in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect in years to come when the question of totally eliminating age discrimination in employment becomes the legal norm, just as the total elimination of discrimination on grounds of gender is now the accepted norm, parliamentary historians will look back on the Minister's contribution and regard it as archaic as some of the statements made here 40 or 50 years ago on gender discrimination.  It is unfortunate that in the society in which we live there is social acceptance of discrimination against older people, and that is reflected in the Bill.  The Minister said that subsection (3) provides for circumstances such as death in service.  Of course it will cost more for death in service if people of 50 rather than 25 are employed.  Any actuary will confirm that.  Subsection (3) <i>de facto</i> allows discrimination.</P>
      <P>On the argument about the maximum age requirement, many people hoped the Employment Equality Bill, which supposedly ends age discrimination, would put an end to the advertisements we often see in newspapers that set down a maximum age limit for applicants, but unfortunately that is not the case.  Under the Bill an employer will still be allowed put an advertisement in the newspaper stating that applicants must be under a certain age, and he may justify that on grounds that it will take too much time or cost too much to train older people.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>At a time when discrimination on a whole range of grounds is declared to be illegal, this House should decide that discrimination on grounds of age is illegal and allow no let-out clause or what the Minister described as economically sensitive employment decisions to stand in the way of ending a practice that is patently unfair to people who are older than other applicants or people in the employment who are treated more favourably.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 34, lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;a particular&rdquo;<Col N="59" /> and substitute &ldquo;the same or an increased&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section is extremely important and relates to workers on the grounds of disability.  We are seeking to qualify section 35(1) which states that:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Part or <i>Part II</i> shall make it unlawful for an employer to provide, for an employee with a disability, a particular rate of remuneration for work of a particular description if, by reason of that disability, the employee is restricted in his or her capacity to do the same amount of work (or to work the same hours) as a person who is employed to do work of that description but who is without that disability.</P>
    <P>The real concern with regard to this subsection is that an employer could employ a person with a disability for a lesser wage than a person who did not have the disability.  I thank the Minister of State for the consultation we had and for the level of interest she has shown in trying to accommodate our concerns with regard to this issue, but a balance must be struck.  I accept the point the Minister of State made on Committee Stage; that we do not want to deter employers from employing a person with a disability in any manner of employment.  At the same time, however, we want to be absolutely certain there is no possibility of an employer being able to use section 35(1) in order to discriminate against a person with a disability in terms of pay.  That is why we are seeking to qualify this subsection.</P>
    <P>The onus to make the decision &mdash; as to whether the person being employed is actually doing work of equal value to other employees &mdash; should neither be on the employer nor the employee.  My preferred option is amendment No. 12 which would provide that the rate of remuneration would have to be sanctioned and approved by the Equality Authority.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that there will be a referee between the employer and the employee.  That referee would be an officer of the Equality Authority who would decide whether the disabled person was doing equal work.  If the subsection is not so amended the legislation will be wide open to abuse by employers who could allege that a person with a disability is not doing an equal amount of work compared to other workers doing the same kind of work.  Unless we amend this subsection that could happen on a widespread basis.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult for someone with a disability to argue against an employer or a prospective employer in this regard.  They need to be sure they are protected by the Equality Authority in terms of the work they are doing and the remuneration they receive.  It is extremely important that we should amend this section of the legislation, otherwise it could be used by employers to discriminate in terms of pay against a person with a disability.</P>

      <P>The big problem for many disabled people is gaining access to employment. Obviously, we want to make it as easy as possible for them and we do not want to place unnecessary barriers in their way.  The Minister of State is concerned that it would be a barrier if any regulations are made concerning this section or if an employer had to refer to a particular authority, such as the Equality Authority or another body. In the long-term that would prove to be a protection for the disabled and it is important for it to be included in the legislation.  It is worrying to build into the legislation a provision which would allow for a different rate of remuneration for those who are disabled.  It is dangerous to do so in this area.  There is a danger that it could be used as a licence to exploit and underpay employees with a disability.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said this issue has not been brought to her attention to any great extent since she assumed responsibility for this area and that the issue of access to employment was a greater problem.  However, I am sure the Minister of State agrees there is concern &mdash; to which she referred &mdash; that people move into training centres, end up staying there for long periods and never move beyond them.  I am afraid that building this provision into the legislation means people would become almost ghettoised in particular job training areas.  They would have neither the ability to take a case nor to move out of those areas.  In fact, as the skills shortage becomes more of an issue, the potential for exploitation will increase even more.</P>
      <P>I am very nervous of putting this into legislation. The Minister of State seems to believe it will create opportunities for people in employment sectors which are currently not available to them.  She should build in a simple mechanism so that if employers want to give a different rate of remuneration they can obtain permission to do so.  It does not have to be bureaucratic and cumbersome or involve much paperwork.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that where a different rate of pay is being used by an employer for someone who is disabled it will only be done in particular circumstances that are fully justified. I accept there are circumstances where it may be appropriate to pay a different wage in the interests of creating job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore originally proposed amending this section so that an employer would have to refer the matter to the director of the Equality Authority to get permission to pay different rates to a disabled person.  It could be even simpler, involving whoever is administering various schemes, such as the employment support scheme, but it does not even have to be at that level.  If such a mechanism was built in, however, one would not run the sort of risks I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald said about this amendment. Basically, the problem is that section 35 will allow <Col N="61" /> employers to pay a lower rate of pay to somebody with a disability.  All they have to demonstrate is that, by the nature of the disability, the employee is restricted in his or her capacity to do the same amount of work or to work the same amount of hours.  This is a licence for a discriminatory and exploitative low pay regime for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The problem that arises is that the employee does not really have any redress in a situation where this would occur.  The employee does not have access to the director of the Equality Authority where the legislation explicitly states that, by virtue of the disability, the amount of work that can be done or the hours of work that can be worked have to be less.  In those circumstances the employee cannot appeal to the Equality Authority.</P>
      <P>I proposed that where an employer proposed to pay a lower rate of pay to somebody with a disability, and to justify that on grounds of the amount of work or hours of work being less, there should be a requirement on the employer to seek the approval of the Equality Authority in advance.  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State expressed concern that that would be very bureaucratic and would impose an undue requirement on employers which would mean they would be less likely to employ somebody with a disability.  Administratively, the way in which this is done could be arranged so that it reduces the amount of bureaucracy.  If an employer decides to employ somebody anyway, a certain amount of paperwork is involved with the tax office, social welfare and so on.  This requirement could be streamlined to tie in with that so it would be a simple, straightforward procedure which would not necessarily involve much investigation and which would reduce the bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>It is undesirable if it is open season and if all an employer must do is to show a disability on the part of the employee to justify a lower rate of pay.  It must be qualified by a provision.  I had hoped the Minister might introduce an amendment to address this but in the absence of one, she should accept that before the House.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 13, which propose to delete &ldquo;a particular&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the same or an increased&rdquo; in subsections (1) and (3) seem to specifically provide that an employee with a disability may be paid more than an employee without a disability or with a different disability, although both are doing the same work.  This, in itself, would be a form of discrimination and would be an inappropriate provision in this anti-discrimination Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broader and more encompassing issue about which Members are concerned is the amendment which proposes to add the words &ldquo;provided that the need for such particular rate is sanctioned by the Equality Authority and the rate of remuneration approved by the Authority.&rdquo; It is a matter of defining whether this proposal will help those I am trying to help or <Col N="62" /> whether it will add an extra layer and cause an additional concern to the employer when he or she decides to take on a person with a disability. That is the issue I must address and, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, I brought this to the attention of Members previously.</P>
    <P>I have been in this job for almost a year and all the correspondence I have received and the concerns expressed to me on the issue of employing people with disabilities, especially those with a learning disability, has centred on access to employment.  Deputies have taken that point on board.  I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for meeting me to discuss this Bill because I wanted to do everything possible and to move as far as possible.</P>
    <P>If a member of one's family has a learning disability or Down's Syndrome and wants to take up a job in the local Burgerland &mdash; I do not know if we are allowed to refer to the McDonalds and Burger Kings of this world &mdash; the company may employ them at a lower rate because they are not doing equal work and are, therefore, not entitled to equal pay under the Bill.  I do not want to cut off the few employment opportunities for these many people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out &mdash; and I raised this point with Members &mdash; there are people with disabilities in lifetime training in training institutions.  We must move from long-term and lifetime training and get as many job opportunities for these people as possible, whether it is for ten hours per week or one hour per day.  We must provide as many incentives and encouragements as possible so that can happen and not place further blocks along the route to prevent it.</P>
    <P>This is the only factor which influenced me when I considered whether these employers should have to get a sanction from somebody, who, in the case of the amendment, is the Equality Authority.  I am concerned it would add another layer of bureaucracy to the possible job opportunities for the many individuals I represent who want a job and not to keep training for life. These people go to training institutions for one, two or three years training but are there ten years later.</P>
    <P>Since Committee Stage I had the opportunity to visit CoAction in Cork.  It is an excellent group which is involved in training people with disabilities for jobs.  I met the job coach and job finder whose daily job is going to supermarkets and other places trying to find jobs suitable for persons in the training institutions so that they will not be in training all their lives.  When addressing the amendment we should ask if we should put another block in that person's way as she visits different employers trying to convince them that they will be supported by CoAction when they take on a person with a disability &mdash; a learning disability in most cases &mdash; whether it is to wheel in trolleys from a carpark or packing groceries. Her job is to convince people that it is a good idea to employ a person with a disability and that <Col N="63" /> they will be supported by her as a job coach and job finder and I cannot put another obstacle in her way.  This amendment would mean she would have to tell the supermarket owner that they must get the approval of the Equality Authority.  She hopes we will do more to help her.  If I accepted the amendment, it would place another block on the route.</P>
    <P>It is important we understand who is covered by the Bill and this section in particular.  Section 35(1) is intended to facilitate the employment of persons whose capacity to do the same amount of work as other employees is restricted.  It must be accepted that in some cases there will be persons with a disability who, even with a reasonable accommodation, will not be in a position to satisfy the principle of equal pay for equal work. This provision is intended to ensure the enactment of the Bill will not act as a disincentive to employment in such cases.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the special difficulties as I have met all the relevant people in the disability area. We thrashed this issue out and held many meetings on it.  I know of the concerns about the wording but I am also aware that some people with disabilities &mdash; perhaps the majority with learning disabilities &mdash; avail of employment opportunities which are an extremely important aspect of their lives.  Although they may not be able to work with the same level of capacity as others, I am reluctant to take any steps which might act as a disincentive to an employer to provide such opportunities and thus reduce the frequency of cases where an employer makes a genuine effort to increase the participation of persons with a disability in employment, particularly such persons whose capacity to perform is seriously restricted because of an employer's fears of equality claims. That is our concern.</P>
    <P>If people are concerned that this subsection is being applied to them and that it should not be applied as they are not one of the categories provided for in this section, that they are doing equal work and entitled to equal pay, they are entitled to bring their case to the Director of Equality Investigations and to the Labour Court.  It is not intended for the general person with a disability who is covered by the anti-discrimination Bill &mdash; the person who is in a position to do equal work but who perhaps requires a reasonable accommodation or whatever.  This section is focused on a different category of person whom I want to support and help.  I want to create incentives, perhaps later in a positive action measure.  In an anti-discrimination <Col N="64" /> measure I do not want to put in any blocks.  Given the small number of job quotas and job finders, this is an area we need to address. Since job finders are in place throughout the country I do not wish to impose further layers of bureaucracy on them.  I have examined this matter in detail but I do not think this amendment would help.  My problem in this area is that I want to create opportunities for employment and access to employment for those covered under this section.  Members here are concerned about another category who might be caught in this net in error.  If so I stress they should appeal their case to the Director of Equality Investigations who can adjudicate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Minister is focusing on a particular group and that her intentions are positive.  The problem the Opposition has is that in assisting this group, the section facilitates possible discrimination against the group which is doing equal work and is entitled to equal pay.  For that reason we seek to amend the subsection to bring the outside referee into the situation to ensure the onus will not be on the person with the disability to prove he or she is capable of doing equal work.  This is an important distinction.  There is a real danger of facilitating discrimination within the legislation. While I accept the Minister's intention in this regard, I am concerned that unless it is qualified in the way suggested, particularly in amendment No. 12, there is a real possibility that the legislation will facilitate discrimination against people with disabilities, thus enabling employers to use this clause to pay less to a person with a disability than to the rest of his employees.  For those reasons I would not be happy to withdraw amendment No. 12 which is in the names of Deputies Fitzgerald, Gilmore, mine and others.</P>

      <P>Members will be familiar with the impact which previous urban renewal schemes have had on many of our cities and towns.  Much of the large scale dereliction and urban decline which prevailed until the late 1980s has been eliminated.  Areas previously written off have attracted extensive investment in commercial and residential development bringing new life to the core of cities and towns which were in serious decline.  It would not be overstating the case to say that the success of the various urban renewal initiatives taken since 1986 has exceeded our wildest expectations.  We have undoubtedly been fortunate that the later years of the urban renewal schemes have coincided with the strongest period of growth ever experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> It is too easy to forget the economic circumstances which dominated the 1980s; circumstances which discouraged investment generally and led to no investment in the less attractive urban areas.  There is no doubt that much of the development which the tax incentive based urban renewal schemes have brought about would not have occurred without the benefit of those incentives and it certainly would not have happened in the areas where it has taken place.</P>
    <P>At a time of strong economic growth, high levels of investment, a booming construction industry and pressure on house prices, it is legitimate to ask if there is any need to continue with the tax incentive based urban renewal schemes.  The answer to that is emphatically &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, provided we start to look at urban renewal from a different point of view &mdash; one which takes account of the social dimension to urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>It will be a key goal of the new scheme provided for in the Bill to nurture and enhance the social dimension to urban renewal. This requires the integration of issues such as community development, education and training and employment and local economic development opportunities into future plans for physical urban renewal.  The objective will be to ensure that the benefits of urban renewal accrue to the many poorer communities in disadvantaged urban areas and not just to developers, investors and new residents.</P>
    <P>This new policy focus is intended to be responsive to the deep-rooted, spatial, socio-economic divisions in many urban areas.  It also forms part of the new public policy approach to tackling poverty and social exclusion, reflecting the growing view that marginalisation and poverty can only be addressed through changes in core policies and service delivery structures and systems.</P>
    <P>Urban disadvantage and poverty are linked in three ways.  First, there is a higher risk of poverty in areas of urban deprivation.</P>

      <P>This debate is of paramount importance to the 150,000 farming families.  Farmers are bemused when they hear of the Celtic tiger.  Our economic performance is the showpiece of Europe and we are very proud of that fact.  However, farmers know that the tiger's footprints are not to be found in the fields of Ireland. All is not well with agriculture.  People are leaving the land at an alarming rate.  In 1981 there were 220,000 farmers.  In 1995 this had reduced to 150,000 &mdash; a reduction of 70,000 or 5,000 farmers for every year.  Against the 5,000 people leaving agriculture, only 670 young farmers entered farming each year via the installation aid scheme.</P>
      <P>The signals are not good and 1997-8 saw the first reduction in students entering agricultural colleges.  I am constantly reminded of the reluctance of young people to enter farming.  Many parents are turning prematurely grey trying to convince a son or daughter to stay.  The more successful the economy and the more jobs that become available the more difficult it is for young farmers to earn an income comparable to that which family members earn in other sectors.  This phenomenon is not confined to small farmers. Even on well run, profitable farms young people do not want to continue farming.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals will take £250 million out of our economy annually.  Worse than that is the fact that the proposals will strike unevenly. Many sectors of the community, such as the beef sector, will not withstand the proposals.  The BSE outbreak is out of the news and the fact that only small numbers have been recorded in the past few months should mean that the prospects for exports will improve.  However, there is a huge decline in farm-related construction spending this year estimated at £70 million to £80 million.</P>
      <P>Before the last election the current Minister for Agriculture and Food stated that if returned to power he would introduce a new control of farmyard pollution scheme, continue the dairy hygiene scheme and introduce a new installation aid scheme for young farmers.  He convinced many farmers that he would deliver on these promises if he became Minister.  He has been Minister for one year but his performance has been disappointing to thousands of farmers.  They believed him before the election and voted accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can it be that in the run-up to the crisis in the year 2000 the Minister is allowing an agricultural economy to be without schemes of this <Col N="71" /> type?  We need someone to instil confidence in the industry.  There are too many black clouds &mdash; real or imaginary.  The Minister has decided to put his head in the sand and this does not augur well for our negotiating stance in the year 2000 when we will need a strong hand in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers run with the class acts such as the computer industry.  We are glad to see this as it is good for employment.  Everyone wants to be associated with a winner.  However, where are the traditional values that Fianna Fáil, in particular, always espoused?  It always said it would back small and medium sized farmers.  I have never heard less about agriculture from any Taoiseach than from Deputy Ahern.  The Minister seems isolated in Cabinet where he has few friends because it does not seem popular to speak of agriculture although it still has huge export earning potential.  There are huge opportunities for job creation, directly and indirectly.  That is in addition to the 150,000 farmers and their families who have to earn a living.  It is not a small industry and should be treated differently.</P>
    <P>No one ever expected the Progressive Democrats to be good for agriculture.  However, I am very disappointed with the three Independents who keep the Government in power &mdash; Deputies Fox, Blaney and Healy-Rae.  They represent rural constituencies.  Are there no young farmers looking for or entitled to installation aid in their constituencies? Do farmers not want a grant to control pollution?  Are there no dairy farmers with a problem with dairy hygiene?  These Deputies will get their chance at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow.  By changing sides they will not bring down the Government but they will send a signal that they do not like what they see when it comes to agriculture. If these Deputies mean what they say to farmers now is the time to show it.</P>
    <P>About 25,000 farmers would apply for the control of pollution grant or the dairy hygiene grant, if available.  These figures come from senior departmental officials.  Control of pollution is not only a matter for farmers or the local community, it is a national environmental problem.  It is vital that we control pollution from whatever source, particularly farmyards, if we are to prevent fish kills such as that last week.</P>
    <P>Any money spent by a farmer on a slatted house, an underground tank which collects slurry, is dead money.  There is no return on such an expensive undertaking.  The smallest slatted house will hold about 50 cattle and cost between £25,000 and £30,000.  There is a need for a substantial grant which would meet about one-third of the cost.  Against this background I put it to the Minister recently at Question Time that it was vitally important that he immediately announce, for the benefit of all concerned, whether it was his intention to introduce a control of farmyard pollution scheme this year.  He knows as well as I do that any developments are planned to coincide with the good summer weather.  Any such scheme should not be announced next November when it <Col N="72" /> would be of no use to anyone.  What will the Minister do for farmers this year so far as control of farmyard pollution grants are concerned?</P>
    <P>On the dairy hygiene scheme, the Government is correctly emphasising the need for quality assurance to ensure the product that leaves the farm is not matched for quality anywhere in the world.  There are approximately 10,000 dairy farmers whose product would not pass this test. If the Minister is not in a position to provide financial help to ensure their yards are up to standard, there will be 10,000 fewer farmers in milk production this time next year.</P>
    <P>Under the installation aid scheme a grant of £5,600 was payable to young farmers under certain conditions.  If the amount payable, which was never increased, had been indexed linked, it would have stood at £10,000 or £11,000 when the scheme was axed.  The sum of £5,600 may not make the difference in a young person deciding to remain in farming but it was the wrong signal to send to an industry that is haemorrhaging badly.  Up to 5,000 farmers are leaving the land annually.  Against this background I cannot understand why the Cabinet will not back the Minister in ensuring every eligible farmer receives a grant.  I understand it is his intention to introduce a more focused scheme.  I do not know what he has in mind but if it is anything like the last one, it will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>At several meetings that I attended before the last general election it was said that the then Minister, Deputy Yates, was not doing enough to have live export markets reopened but no man did more to have them reopened.  Unfortunately for Fine Gael, the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture agreed in principle on election day to reopen that market.  I do not want to be too critical as I know the Minister's heart is in the right place but it is results that count.  The Minister told farmers that on his return to Agriculture House he would have markets reopened but that is not the way it has turned out.  It appears that we are as far away as ever from having them reopened.</P>
    <P>To ensure competition with the meat factories there is a need to put ships on the high seas.  The live export trade is invaluable to farmers.  We export nine out of every ten cattle that we produce.  The Minister is to be congratulated for providing £1 million to fund the service to the Continent.  To whom was this money allocated and why is a service currently not being provided?</P>
    <P>Farmers are hoping that this year will be better than last year.  It is when the industry is in a depressed state that a good Minister proves his or her worth.  I have great faith in the resilience of farmers.  If given half a chance, they will respond. In recent weeks there was a skirmish over the £114 million allocated for the Luas project.  It appears the Minister did not secure any of this for the control of farmyard pollution scheme or any of the other schemes mentioned.  I hope he will respond to our promptings and instil an air <Col N="73" /> of confidence in farmers so that the industry can move forward with hope and vitality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me.  I support the motion and compliment Deputy Connaughton on introducing it.</P>
      <P>Despairing, disillusioned and discouraged are mild words to describe the attitude of an ever increasing number of farmers.  This attitude stems from the Minister's half-hearted and lethargic approach to agriculture and its problems.  At Question Time earlier he defended the Department's so-called even-handed approach to farmers and their wives in relation to their separate applications to participate in various schemes.  He outlined the rules and regulations and stated that the sharing of labour, machinery and accounts would be ample evidence in deeming the implications to be invalid.  Further participation would be prevented.  Decent, ordinary, hardworking people are being harassed by departmental officials.  At the same time the Minister and his officials are turning a blind eye to a situation where they are blatantly manipulating the scheme themselves.</P>
      <P>The Department and Teagasc operate a number of farms as research centres with a different herd number for each.  There are two in my constituency, one with 350 cattle and a flock of sheep and the other with 500 cattle and a flock of sheep. Farm machinery and manual labour are shared between both farms.  Does the Minister propose to apply decision reports to the Department and</P>
      <P>Teagasc herd numbers nationwide, given they are in the same ownership, return the same accounts and share machinery and labour?  Since Teagasc and the Department would have the limit of one herd for headage and premia nationwide, will the Minister, in accordance with natural procedure, ensure recoupment of the overclaimed moneys and, in the interest of fairness, with interest and penalties?</P>
      <P>In a recent letter to a farmer, the Department of Agriculture and Food stated it had been advised by the Attorney General that where any doubt exists as to separate and independent farming, applications under the schemes should be rejected.  Does that represent a policy of guilty until proven innocent?  Is that in line with citizens' constitutional rights, given that the principle of innocent until proven guilty underpins the State's constitutional legal system?  I note the Minister mentioned that information is voluntarily given, yet it is requested with a demand attitude and no grants are paid in the interim.  Is that the new definition of &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; emanating from Agriculture House?</P>
      <P>The independent appeal's board under REPS is anything but independent because those who are members of it operate the scheme on a daily basis.  Is that natural justice?  Are all the decisions it has taken null and void?  Perhaps the Attorney General has given it the advice it wants to hear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate Deputy Connaughton on tabling this timely and comprehensive motion which deals with difficulties faced by farmers and the agricultural industry.  I wish to deal specifically with an item that has caused a great deal of frustration for farmers over a period, the delay in returning the 30-day brucellosis test results.  That delay has caused farmers great difficulties.  Rural Deputies recently received more complaints about that delay than any other matter.  Farmers throughout the country are complaining about the excessive length of time it takes the Department to process those test results.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently stated there has been some improvement in this area, but that resulted from a fall in cattle sales.  This is a period when sales drop and the Department is bound to make some inroads in issuing such test results. However, the same problem will exist come the fall.  Will the Minister ensure proper facilities are in place and there is an adequate number of staff in the Department and the laboratory in Cork to ensure those test results are issued to farmers within seven to ten days.  Many farmers have had to wait up to 15 days for their results.  I have heard reports from farmers who have had to wait more than 20 days from the day the blood test was taken by the veterinary surgeon to the day the result was communicated from the laboratory in Cork.  Despite the long run-in time before the brucellosis scheme was introduced, it appears the Minister and the Department have not made appropriate plans to cater for the increased volume of tests which it must have known it would have to deal with.</P>
      <P>It is reported that the brucellosis kits supplied to the laboratory in Cork were in short supply at one stage.  Is that still the case?  That was a cause of most of the delays.  That is an administrative matter and it could easily have been sorted out by the Minister and the Department.  Priority must be given to ensure that the 30-day test does not frustrate the sale of cattle and that farmers are given the maximum opportunity to show their cattle at marts and so on.  I understand sales of pedigree bulls have fallen this year because farmers found it difficult to ensure they could move bulls to marts for sale in time.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me.  The control of farm pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme remain suspended and as a result no farm investment schemes exist for the first time in nearly 50 years.  That is unbelievable and discouraging to young people getting into farming.  Investment is critical to ensure the survival of any business and agriculture is certainly discriminated against. Farmers want to maintain what they have, but the future looks bleak for them, if they do not get some form of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the horticulture sector which is critical due to the major development of our <Col N="75" /> food sector.  I plead with the Minister to make more funds available to growers to enable them develop their businesses.  If agriculture is to develop, diversification will be an important factor.  Major buyers in the supermarket trade inspect growers' premises and many require major improvement works to be carried out on their farms.  Funds and grants are needed if farmers are to do that.  The amount of imported vegetables from Europe on sale in the Dublin fruit market is criminal.  We have a fine country and we should be able to meet the needs of our home fruit market.</P>
    <P>A Northern dealer I spoke to at Ballymote mart during the week told me he had stopped attending it because heifers are allowed only one movement under the 30-day test.  Ballymote mart was a centre for Northern people to buy heifers, but they have stopped attending it.  Something should be done about that measure which is creating a big loss for a small town like Ballymote.</P>
    <P>It is imperative the Border counties, the west and the midlands qualify for objective one status. When the Taoiseach was in Opposition he stated that when he got into Government he would address this issue.  However, the EU Commissioner stated that unless regional structures are put in place she cannot grant objective one status to those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on raising this very important issue. The Government is 12 months in office, and I recall the abuse given by the then Opposition spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Cowen, the then Deputy Walsh, and above all by the former leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, when my party was in Government.  We were in the midst of a major BSE crisis and those Opposition Members said the then Government was doing nothing to assist the export of live cattle and the sale of beef to countries, such as Iran.  They told us what they would do if they were in Government. Their promises were unbelievable but, unfortunately, they have turned out to be just that.  They were not capable of doing what they promised.  Live cattle were already in transit on boats when the BSE scare was made public in Westminster Parliament.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, telephoned his counterpart in the midst of the crisis and was able to arrange not only for those boats to be unloaded, but to reopen the trade with Egypt.  One begs to ask the question, what the Minister and, more important, the Government has done in their 12 months in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when in Opposition, made it clear that if he had been in Government he would have boarded a plane to try to resolve the problem. Every effort was made to split the then coalition by accusing the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs of failure to re-open the markets with Egypt, Iran and other countries.  What <Col N="76" /> has the Minister for Foreign Affairs done?  Three or four of them when in Opposition went to Iran when the boats were already being unloaded to try to claim they were getting the market opened. It reminds me of the time the then leader of the Opposition, Charles Haughey, went to Libya and did a deal in the sand which did not come off.</P>
    <P>The honeymoon is over.  The Minister is a nice man, something I have already said to him, and it is easy to be friendly with him.  However, one must ask what he has been able to deliver as Minister at a time of great prosperity.  The economy was never as flush with money.  Yet the Department of Agriculture and Food is £34 million worse off this year as a result of the budget. Was the Minister at the Cabinet table?  Are the Taoiseach and the Government committed to agriculture?  Before the election we were promised that young farmers could be sure of a great future under a Fianna Fáil led Government.  What have the Progressive Democrats done to the Government?  Is it that party's fault or the Minister's fault that installation aid is no longer available? Promises were made that it would be available. I know the Minister assured Macra, the Opposition and others that he would reintroduce a programme.  However, I warn him that we do not want a Mickey Mouse type programme but one that will give young farmers the opportunity to take up farming in a businesslike manner.</P>
    <P>Installation aid is not enough.  Fianna Fáil promised that a farmyard pollution scheme would be introduced immediately if it was returned to Government but there is no indication of this happening.  I appreciate that the Minister said if there were EU or other funds available he would make sure they were used for this purpose. However, as Deputy Connaughton stated, Luas seems to have come and gone and there are no farmyard pollution or dairy hygiene schemes.  We need some sort of commitment at this stage. Young farmers should be told there is some future.  Agricultural colleges found it impossible this year to get recruits.  We look forward to the Minister's comments and hope there will be guarantees that young farmers and their families will have some future.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to cut the price of beef by 30 per cent under the Santer proposals.  It will be difficult to get all we want in terms of the Santer proposals, but it will be more difficult if the Government does not show its commitment to agriculture.  I accept the Minister's statement that he is getting the support of the Taoiseach at different negotiations in Europe.  However, he needs the public support of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the rest of the Cabinet through the reintroduction of what is necessary for young farmers if he is to be even listened to at European level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a crucial motion.  A headline in one of last Sunday's newspapers read: &ldquo;Irish farming population dwindling&rdquo;.  Statistics show that only 14 per cent of farmers are under <Col N="77" /> the age of 35 years, yet this age group represents over 50 per cent of the population.  In the period from 1985-94, 67,000 farms have disappeared. Young people have lost confidence in the agricultural industry and the Government's ability to ensure the economic survival of the sector.  There was a 9 per cent drop in the number of entrants to agricultural colleges in 1997-8.</P>
      <P>On average farm incomes are just above £10,000.  Yet the Government has abandoned installation aid for young farmers.  Installation aid was one of the small financial encouragements which young courageous people received to take up this difficult profession.  Young people are given no encouragement to take up full-time employment in farming.  In 1996 the IDA aided 13,319 jobs at an approximate cost of £11,920 per job.  Yet a meagre grant of £5,600 for young farmers, designed to encourage them into the agricultural industry and a career in farming, was cut. How can the Minister for Agriculture and Food expect young people to choose a career in farming, given its long hours, the necessity of working in all weathers, variable and unstable income and huge overheads, over a stable, well paid Government supported industrial job?  We are reaching the stage where there will be shortages in the agricultural employment sector.  This can already be seen in rural areas where people are moving to towns and cities to take up well paid jobs leaving no young people to work the land.  More young people are taking up third level courses, except for the certificate in farming in agricultural colleges.  For the first time in ten years these colleges are unable to fill places on offer because of the Minister's inability to display confidence in the industry and in young farmers through the provision of installation aid and proper support systems.</P>
      <P>In its election manifesto Fianna Fáil stated that in Government it would initiate a comprehensive programme of rural development.  Judging from the Minister's actions to date, the programme is one of rural destruction.  The Minister will be remembered as the man who killed rural Ireland. I ask him to deliver on his promise and that of Fianna Fáil candidates prior to the general election that installation aid would not be abandoned. Talk is cheap and the Minister now has an opportunity to deliver on the promise on which he reneged following the general election.  It would be a small step in bringing an end to the discrimination against young farmers at the hands of previous Governments but especially this one.  How can the Minister stand over a policy of funding one job to the tune of £11,920 while cutting grant aid for another?</P>
      <P>Teagasc must maintain better contact with its green certificate students following completion of their course.  It must put a discount scheme in place.  It is a disgrace that it costs £550 for a young person to draw up a REPS plan with no help available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enlargement clause in the farm retirement scheme regulations inhibits young people wishing <Col N="78" /> to enter the agricultural industry.  If a young person decides to go to college the State will fund them to the tune of £10,000 to £12,000.  However, it will not give farmers £5,600.</P>
    <P>Given current concern over Agenda 2000 the Minister must instil confidence in the industry.  I, therefore, appeal to him to introduce installation aid immediately and bring forward a comprehensive package of supports for young farmers.  The current tax system is inhibiting reinvestment in farming; stamp duty and capital gains tax should be removed for all young people.  They must have greater access to quotas and there is an urgent need to restructure the farm retirement scheme. These initiatives, with a proper subsidised service from Teagasc and other State agencies, would at least make farming a viable option for young people.  There are many farmers here tonight, but very few young people, because they have lost interest in the agricultural industry, a situation not helped by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The recent decision by the Government, with the approval of the EU, to reduce the SAC and NHA payments in up to 6,000 cases is not helping many small farmers.  This will crucify many farmers in disadvantaged areas with small designated areas.  Many of these were planning farm investment on the basis of receiving this money until the Government's U-turn.  Will the Minister consider reintroducing the control of farmyard pollution scheme, if only for the people in these areas who will be under severe pressure from environmentalists and the Department to control pollution?  Some form of compensation must be given to them.  It also indicates a blatant discrimination in the context of the midland counties and their bogs, lakes and rivers.  These areas have been seriously discriminated against as a result of this U-turn.  Farmers in parts of the west of Ireland have got a good deal and I congratulate them on that but smallholders in the midland counties will be crucified by the Government's decision.</P>

    <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton and his colleagues for tabling this motion as it is important our primary industry is brought to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of responding to this debate although I reject in the strongest possible terms the Opposition's suggestions in regard to the specific issues raised.  The Opposition has also totally ignored the progress which has been made on a broad range of measures since this Government took office.  The Government takes agriculture seriously and has a clear programme for the development of a sector which is still vital for the overall national economy. While numbers in the sector may have declined in the past 50 years, agriculture is still three times more significant to Ireland than to EU economies generally.</P>
    <P>The role of the agri-food sector continues to be of vital importance in the Irish economy.  The sector accounts for an estimated 14.2 per cent of GDP, 13.4 per cent of employment and 13.2 per cent of exports.  Agri-food exports accounted for more than £5,000 million in 1997 which shows the sector to be a critical part of the overall economy by any standards.</P>
    <P>The farm family remains the cornerstone of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>As well as its economic importance, the well-being of agriculture is important for the fabric of rural society and for rural development generally.  Some important changes have been taking place, including a greater dependence on direct payments and a growing trend towards part-time farming.  The most recent household budget survey shows that only half of total farm household income now derives from farming activity and some 47 per cent of income derives from direct payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before moving on to deal with the particular areas listed for debate under this motion, it is important to put in context the level of support provided for agriculture.  The total expenditure of the Department of Agriculture and Food in 1997 exceeded £2 billion.  All of this was spent on supporting farmers and the agri-food sector.  For example, £941 million was spent on direct payments to farmers; £783 million was spent on market supports; £196 million was spent on farm <Col N="80" /> investment grants and disease controls, and, £122 million was spent on administration in the Department, including administration of the more than 80 schemes the Department runs to support the farm and food sectors.  It is clear that, from the point of view of the farmer, the making of direct payments must be regarded as very important.</P>
    <P>The contribution of direct payments to aggregate farm income has been rising steadily in recent years, from 12 per cent in 1989 to 47 per cent last year.  The dependence of the farming community on these payments is fully appreciated both by me and by my Department and we are committed to expeditious payment in all instances.  However, in disbursing public funds, both EU and national, we are obliged to ensure such funding is made strictly in accordance with relevant regulatory requirements.  I am sure nobody would argue the situation should be otherwise.  In fact, parliamentary questions are tabled virtually on a daily basis in regard to whether the Government is meeting its commitments under EU regulations.  The schemes are, therefore, subject to strict auditing requirements and many of these schemes are complex.  I regret that in recent times proper probity in disbursement of public funds is being misconstrued as latent distrust of the farming community on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This notion must be rejected as utter nonsense as the Department is determined to ensure the farming community benefits to the maximum extent from all available funding.  The record shows this to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Department is committed to providing high quality, user-friendly services to the Irish farming community and is constantly striving to ensure and improve the quality of that service. The most recent initiative is the customer service action plan which I launched last month.  To further emphasise the importance of customer service the Department has placed quality, not as a separate item, but as an integral part of all operations, in its statement of strategy.</P>
    <P>Under the customer service action plan, delivery targets are established for the payment of EU and national direct payments to farmers, including headage, premia, grants and compensation packages.  In regard to EU funded schemes, these targets provide for the most expeditious payment service of any member state in the EU and are considerably shorter than the eligible period allowed under the relevant regulations.  In spite of the tight, self-imposed deadlines, payments targets are generally met and more than 90 per cent of payments are made by target date in respect of all relevant schemes.  Most of the cases where the payment target is not met relate to instances where the applicant is either ineligible or further information is required to determine entitlement. Every possible effort is made to determine entitlement and to pay farmers their due entitlements.</P>

      <P>On 24 April, revised arrangements were introduced for the operation of the area aid unit.  This involved the division of the unit's work into five sections, on a county basis in proportion with the number of applications in each county. To enable the staff in the unit to clear up a backlog of 19,700 cases, it was necessary to close the office to the public for a month.  Having cleared the backlog, the office reopened in the last week of May.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the large number of farmers who have responded to the unit's requests for further material, particularly maps, in support of applications.  I would also urge any remaining farmers who have not responded or any farmers who have received lower than expected payments to contact the unit immediately if the payment statement indicates that an area aid penalty has been applied.</P>
      <P>In relation to 1998 applications, the revised methodology for handling claims will remain in place.  In this regard I would like to thank the staff in my Department's local livestock offices and Teagasc staff for the help they gave farmers in completing their 1998 applications.  I would also like to thank the agricultural media which is extremely helpful in informing farmers of deadlines and so on.  Finally, I am confident that, with the area aid unit starting its work without a 1997 overhang, it will be able to ensure that farmers will not encounter area aid related payment delays in respect of their 1998 payments.  The co-operation of farmers is, of course, a critical factor here and, in the light of the changes I have outlined, it is clear that the area aid unit has in fact been reorganised.  We are starting with a clean sheet and I do not foresee any delays in regard to 1998 applications.</P>
      <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme has had a very positive impact on pollution control and environmental protection on many farms. Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-9, some £100 million was made available for the scheme.  Due to the high level of demand, it was decided to suspend the acceptance of new applications in April 1995.  When the scheme was suspended, there were some 18,400 applications in hand.  Up to the end of May 1998, approximately 18,070 applications had been fully processed and approvals had issued in respect of 15,740, representing a grant commitment of some £148 million.  A further 2,330 decided not to proceed with their applications following consultation with local officers of the Department.  The balance of 330 applications involve the provision of necessary information to the Department and those are being processed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, I succeeded in having additional funding of £20 million made available to the scheme in July 1997.  The Government <Col N="82" /> made a further £9.5 million available from national Exchequer funds in the 1997 Supplementary Estimate as well as £3 million in savings in 1997.  Therefore, I have made considerable funding available for this measure and I should add that this scheme was closed in 1995 long before I took up office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>By the end of May 1998, almost 14,000 payments, involving almost £118 million, had been made under the scheme.  Grant assistance is not the only way of encouraging pollution control.  The capital allowance scheme for necessary pollution control works operates from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000.  The level of expenditure which qualifies under the scheme was increased from £20,000 to £30,000 in the Finance Act, 1998.  The special provision allows farmers to write-off 50 per cent of qualifying expenditure on pollution control measures against their taxable incomes in the year the investment is made.  The balance of the qualifying expenditure is written-off in accordance with the normal capital scheme.</P>

      <P>In relation to the dairy hygiene scheme, £29 million was available for the measure under the operational programme.  Due to the extremely high level of demand compared with the funding provided, it was decided to suspend the acceptance of new applications in October 1996.  When the scheme was suspended there were 7,900 applications in hand.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of May 1998, about 7,500 applications had been processed and approvals had issued in respect of 6,800, representing a grant commitment of £40.5 million.  A further 740 applicants decided not to proceed with their applications following consultation with local officers of the Department.  The balance of 360 applications either involve the need to return necessary information to the Department or are being processed.</P>

      <P>By the end of May 1998, a total of £22.9 million had been paid to 3,640 applicants.</P>
      <P>In the mid-term review of the Structural Funds an additional sum of £8.5 million was made available which brought the overall allocation for the scheme to £37.5 million.  In addition, a further £2.7 million in Exchequer funds was made available in the 1997 Supplementary Estimate.  With regard to both schemes, I am monitoring developments in the Community Support Framework carefully.  In the event of funds becoming available due to certain decommitments, I will seek additional resources for the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> On the broader front, and in line with An Action Programme for the Millennium, I regard on-farm investment as a high priority.  In that context, I am currently examining funding possibilities for more focused schemes for farm pollution and dairy hygiene.  However, even in their more focused form, these schemes require significant levels of funding.</P>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was highly successful in assisting young farmers to embark on their careers.  Since the inception of the scheme in 1986, 6,478 applicants have been paid aid of about £38 million.  Under the current operational programme, a total of £17 million was made available for the scheme on the basis that about 3,000 young farmers would participate in the 1994-9 period.  This projected number was reached by mid-1997 and it was necessary to suspend the scheme in August 1997 in respect of new applications.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 600 applications, received by the Department before the suspension date of the scheme, currently being processed with a potential grant commitment of a further £3.2 million approximately.</P>
      <P>I am firmly committed to the reintroduction of the scheme.  I have obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the introduction of a more tightly focused revised scheme targeted towards smaller farmers who are in most need of assistance.  The scheme will be financed solely by the Exchequer and in the current financial year the funding will have to be found from the resources of the Department.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with various farming organisations, the terms of the revised scheme are currently being finalised.  The formal approval of the Minister for Finance and also the approval of the EU Commission will be required before the scheme can come into operation.  I will endeavour to secure the necessary approvals as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The live cattle trade has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  The markets in Egypt and Libya have been closed for some time and I have devoted considerable time and effort to reopening them.  Every possible avenue has been pursued.  Following my visit to Cairo last year, for example, I forwarded a detailed proposal for a trial shipment to the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture.  The proposal was drawn up following a veterinary and engineering assessment of slaughtering facilities in Egypt.</P>
      <P>The proposal was discussed with the Egyptian authorities during a visit of a technical delegation from my Department to Cairo last February.  A considerable amount of technical information has been provided and, while the proposal remains under consideration, the Egyptian authorities have not yet given a positive decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <P>Not one animal has been exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, imports of Irish frozen beef to that market have increased significantly. Egypt is now taking close to 80,000 tonnes of beef, a considerable increase on the previous year.  The further development of trade will be pursued at every appropriate opportunity especially through contacts at ministerial level. My ministerial colleagues have also raised the matter with various contacts.</P>
      <P>I met the Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally, again in Cairo last month. My objective is to ensure that the Egyptians fully understand the effectiveness of our BSE controls. I pointed to the decline in the number of instances of BSE and reiterated my demand that Irish live cattle be allowed back onto the Egyptian market.</P>
      <P>Libya imposed a ban on cattle and beef imports from all European countries in April 1996.  Since then, efforts have continued to have the ban lifted in respect of imports from Ireland.  Again, considerable technical information was provided especially during a visit of a Libyan technical delegation to Ireland in March 1997.  It is understood that Libya is satisfied with the animal health controls in Ireland.  They have no difficulty with them and the technical delegation reported favourably on them to Tripoli.  The latest development is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs invited senior Libyan officials to visit Ireland for discussions on a range of matters of mutual interest.  No response has been received to date but the ambassador in Rome is due to visit Libya next week to follow up on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is worth mentioning one country where a new market has been developed.  Live cattle are being exported to Lebanon in increasing numbers. Last year, more than 2,000 head of cattle were exported to this market while the figure for this year is likely to be ten times that amount. Last week I was in Lebanon and met both the Prime Minister and the Agriculture Minister as well as a wide representation of the trade involved in the import of live animals.  This is a valuable trade which it is expected will continue to contribute towards maintaining prices for Irish beef and cattle producers.  Therefore, I can defend the Government's and my own record on this issue.  We have pursued the case with vigour and no effort has been spared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a start and every possible avenue and access route to various markets is being pursued at every level &mdash; political, diplomatic and industrial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a high priority to <Col N="85" /> exports of livestock to the Continent.  Following the declared withdrawal by Pandoro in 1997 from the carriage of livestock, I sought and obtained Government approval for a once-off State aid of £1 million to assist in the start-up of a ferry service between Cork and Cherbourg to facilitate animal exports to continental European markets. This service proved to be of great value during the critical winter months last year.  However, this State aid is now the subject of an examination by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The provision of a further ferry operation over and above the existing services which would be committed to the carriage of livestock to export markets is, in the first instance, a matter for commercial interests to evaluate.  Such interests are now examining the options available in that regard.  I will continue to give every appropriate encouragement and assistance to them in their deliberations.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I can confirm that, following a trial shipment, the new Irish Ferries ship, the mv <i>Normandy</i>, has been approved by the Department to carry a limited number of units.  In addition, the Department recently inspected and approved an aeroplane for calf transport.  Seven flights to the Netherlands have taken place thus far with further flights reserved every day this week.</P>
      <P>With regard to animal traceability, Ireland already has a variety of measures in place to identify and trace bovine animals.  We are well on the way to having a full traceability system.  All cattle are tagged at birth with a unique identification number.  There is a cattle identity card for each animal and this card must be produced each time the animal is moved.  Since 1996, a national calf birth registration centre is in place.  In January this year, the card was expanded to include a wide variety of additional information.  Work on the new system with a view to incorporating records on all animal movements is well advanced.  It entails recording all movements of cattle to and from farms and marts, to meat factories and for live export.  The use of this data will verify the origin, identity and life history of animals before they enter the food chain.</P>
      <P>It is a huge undertaking which involves capturing details of millions of animal movements each year among 150,000 herds, through 110 marts, to 470 abattoirs and for export.  Maximum use is being made of electronic means to capture the information.  It is not being collected for the sake of having information.  It is required as an absolute minimum by our importers and customers. They demand traceability and a record of cattle movements and we are providing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed arrangements for the implementation of a comprehensive traceability scheme include the following.  A major enlargement of the Department's mainframe computer system was carried out in the last year.  We have had extensive negotiations and discussions with industry partners about the design of the system and systems design and computer specifications for the <Col N="86" /> new system have been completed.  Computer links have been established with all marts and computers have been installed in 48 marts.  We are upgrading the computer links and equipment already established in meat factories to provide for a live computer system and we have engaged an outside agency to complete our computer programming requirements.  We are also about to engage an outside agency to operate a paper notification system.  Over the coming months we will complete the outstanding tasks.</P>
    <P>To summarise, most of the building blocks of an animal traceability system are already in place and working, and solid progress is being made on the detailed implementation of the project.  I am confident that, with the co-operation of all in the industry, the final element of the system will be operational later this year.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has also been made with regard to the introduction of the national beef assurance scheme.  A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed and we are on target to introduce the scheme later this year.</P>
    <P>The scheme will provide credible and independently backed assurances about the safety of Irish beef.  This will be done by enforcing common high standards of production and processing and by providing the comprehensive and effective animal identification and tracing system I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The other main element of the scheme is the development of protocols which set out in clear and succinct terms the baseline standards for all who trade in cattle and beef.  These protocols have been discussed extensively with the industry and are in the course of being finalised.  They contain a comprehensive statement of the standards that are required of those engaged in the industry from farming to processing.  For the most part they draw on and consolidate existing provisions and will not generate excessive costs for farmers. These protocols will be enforced through a process of inspection and approval.  They will be underpinned by national legislation and it is my intention to present proposals to Cabinet on this over the summer months.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, there has been a significant deterioration in the overall incidence of brucellosis in cattle over the past two years. While the main problem continues to be in the south-western part of the country, there was at least one brucellosis breakdown in all but two counties in 1997.  Against that background and following prolonged discussions, I introduced a range of additional measures in the middle of 1997 and again earlier this year.  These measures were designed to safeguard public and animal health and to protect our trading outlets for both livestock and livestock products.</P>
    <P>The additional testing regime resulted in a huge increase in the volume of blood samples received for testing in both the Cork brucellosis laboratory and the regional veterinary laboratory in Sligo.  An extra one million blood samples were <Col N="87" /> received in the Cork laboratory up to the end of May 1998 compared with the corresponding period in 1997.  In some weeks the numbers of samples received were in the region of 150,000.</P>
    <P>Additional staff were recruited from April onward to cope with the extra volume of work in the Cork laboratory.  As Deputy Neville and others said, despite this the laboratory was unable to cope with the greatly increased throughput in the period following Easter.  At the same time, priority was given to processing private or pre-movement blood samples where these were so identified by private practitioners.  Some delays did occur in the laboratory in processing other blood samples.  The position now is that following initiatives taken by me there are no arrears in the laboratory and processing of blood samples commences on the dates they are received in the laboratory.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and I visited the laboratory about two weeks ago. We were given a commitment by the staff that they would clear the backlog and have a clean sheet within two weeks.  I compliment them on that.  They worked overtime and over the bank holiday weekend.  They did a fantastic job for the farming industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They assured me that with the improved facilities and additional staff, they will be able to cope.  Nonetheless, we are monitoring the situation carefully.  A number of further measures are being taken to underpin the improved service.  These include an inquiry desk to help farmers and practitioners who wish to inquire about samples, further e-mail facilities and the use of An Post's swiftpost system for delivery of test samples to the Cork laboratory. This latter system includes a guaranteed delivery timescale as well as a tracking and tracing capability. In some cases, the amount of time it took An Post to deliver samples from practitioners to the laboratory was inordinately slow.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the systems in place and the measures I have taken enable the Cork laboratory to provide a satisfactory turnaround for the volume of blood that will now be received.  Some further steps are being taken to speed up deliveries and if delays do occur, to identify where they are occurring.  I will ensure the system is closely monitored.  This highly automated laboratory is capable of processing large volumes.</P>
      <P>Turning to wider issues, since coming into office a year ago and in addition to the steps I outlined, I have taken significant actions on a general level to underpin the farm and food industries and to lay the foundations for future growth.  I have been supported by both my ministerial colleagues, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and Deputy Davern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have benefited substantially from the <Col N="88" /> 1997 Supplementary Vote for Agriculture of £63 million, which included funding for farm pollution costs, disease control and headage.  The 1998 budget also brought changes to the tax regime, including concessions on stock relief, capital write-offs under the farm pollution control scheme and VAT changes.  The series of high level meetings which have taken place with importing countries and food buyers have brought success through better cattle prices.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion on behalf of the Labour Party.  I commend Fine Gael for tabling it as it is opportune to initiate a debate on current agricultural policy and the future of agriculture. While the motion relates to current Government policy on agriculture, we cannot isolate this debate from the discussion of the Agenda 2000 proposals.</P>
      <P>There was a plethora of promises by the then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, that it would rectify the ills of farmers.  These were dispensed like confetti prior to the last general election.  The Minister is now reaping the whirlwinds of these foolish promises.  People are beginning to wake up to the fact that CAP reform has failed to deliver in its efforts to maintain the maximum number of farming families on the land.  It has also failed to provide food at affordable prices for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the CAP negotiations, the EU Commission set out a number of objectives; to increase competitiveness to allow farmers take full advantage of world market developments; to improve safety and quality for the consumer; and to provide alternative incomes and jobs for farming <Col N="89" /> families.  The EU has failed miserably in delivering these objectives.</P>
    <P>One only has to examine Irish statistics.  Five thousand farmers are leaving the industry annually &mdash; 100 per week.  Young people are not interested in farming as a career.  There is plenty of evidence of this in the midlands and my county of Westmeath.  Farmers with 100 or 120 acres ask me to intercede with their sons to take over the farm.  It is difficult to explain to a young farmer that they will not have the weekly wage available in industry.  That is what makes the decision to suspend installation aid so mind boggling.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the amount involved but the signal which was sent and the psychological impact it had.  I take issue with a recent editorial in a farming paper which seemed to downplay the significance of this decision.  No one is saying it is the be all and end all but it was very important for the six or seven thousand young farmers to whom £5,600 was a small amount of money. Nevertheless it was an injection during the critical period of the transfer of the family farm.  Who can say it did not play an important socio-economic role in ensuring farms were transferred at an earlier stage?  That was one of the objectives in the 1970s when I studied agriculture under Professor Sheehy in UCD.</P>
    <P>The installation aid scheme was suspended on 7 August.  While the Minister fairly made the point that there is no money in the bag to finance the scheme, in the budget on 3 December £3.5 million was made available.  That money, however, was to finance outstanding applications. Young farmers thought they could take part in the scheme again, but that was not the case.  Legally the Minister was in the mire.  He had to honour previous commitments, otherwise he would have been on the steps of the Four Courts.  That is why the money was made available.  Many people were confused and thought they had a chance to take part in the scheme again, but it remained in a suspended state.  All that happened was that outstanding commitments were fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the drop off in numbers participating in agricultural colleges in the 1997-8 academic year.  In 1976 I attended the picturesque agricultural college in Multyfarnham, situated on the shores of Lough Derravaragh.  At that time people had to queue to get into that college. There has been a 9 per cent drop in the number of people attending agricultural colleges this year &mdash; there are only 850 students in Multyfarnham college which has capacity for 950.  Likewise, there has been a significant drop in the number of people attending Teagasc training centres. There are other attractions for young people today.  The economy is booming and young people are taking up jobs which offer a weekly wage.  The question must be asked whether the drop in numbers attending agricultural colleges and Teagasc training centres coincided with the suspension of the installation aid scheme.  While it cannot be stated definitively that the two are linked, there is some link.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> With the recently published Santer proposals, there is further bad news for young farmers.  In the long term those proposals will make it more difficult to attract young people to agriculture. The additional 1 per cent quota allocated to Ireland is wholly inadequate.  From various proposals emanating from the farming organisations, we need in the region of 7 or 8 per cent of quota. The EU Commission recommended that young farmers should be a priority category for the distribution of available quotas.  The allocation of 1 per cent is not encouraging and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure we secure our rights, as committed to us in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Recent figures from the Central Statistics Office confirm that on average our farmers are the oldest in Europe, with only 14 per cent under the age of 35.  That makes Irish farmers on average about 50 years older than their Australian and New Zealand counterparts.  People living in rural Ireland will be aware of the drift from the land, which is proceeding at an alarming rate.  If a factory was to close with job losses of that magnitude the Dáil would be suspended under Standing Order 31 and there would be Adjournment debates, but because this matter affects agriculture it is taken lightly by politicians and the media.  About 100 people per week are leaving the land.  If any other industry was involved the Government of the day would establish a task force to alleviate the plight of the people affected. The last thing it would do is suspend a scheme that is of vital importance to that sector.</P>
    <P>The installation aid grant amounted to £5,600 and in order to qualify a person had to have specific educational qualifications and be under the age of 35.  It would cost about £5.5 million or £6 million to continue the old scheme.  When I raised this matter in an Adjournment debate on 28 May the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, deputising for the Minister, indicated that the Minister had secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to introduce a targeted and focused scheme, but targeted at whom and focused on what? Those questions must be answered.  The Celtic tiger means nothing in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>There will be an extra £600 million in revenue over and above the projected tax revenue announced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the budget.  Only 0.75 per cent of that amount would be needed to introduce an installation aid scheme.  As Deputy Connaughton said, the average cost of an IDA job is about £11,700.  For less than half that amount we could secure the future of a young farmer.  If that money was made available it would send a clear signal to people in rural Ireland that we are interested in them and that we want to stop the drift from farming.  It would be an important impetus for rural regeneration.  It would also help rural industries, shops and agricultural contractors. There would be a massive spin-off effect.  In <Col N="91" /> economic terms agriculture has a greater effect on the economy than any other industry.  I urge the Minister to introduce a meaningful scheme that serves the desired purpose.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues, some of which I raised today during Question Time.  Small dairy farmers who keep suckler cows experience grave difficulties.  Under the suckler cow scheme the milk quota ceiling of 25,638 gallons should be increased to facilitate smaller farmers.  In order to make a living, many suckler cow farmers have had to become involved in dairying.  I know of a farmer who had a quota of 28,000 gallons and wanted to lease 4,000 or 5,000 gallons to the local co-operative.  He also kept suckler cows and applied for the suckler cow premium.  Since the co-operative operates a leasing arrangement for only one year under the temporary leasing scheme and the Department insists on a three year minimum period, this person was in a catch 22 position.  The Government should help rather than hinder people.  This young married man with four or five children was deprived of £2,500 or £3,000 in vital subsidy.  That man, who attended agricultural college with me, has all the relevant qualifications, but the Government puts impediments in his progress.  Eventually people such as that give up and lease all their quota.</P>
      <P>The Minister today gave a number of positive indications about the farm retirement scheme and I acknowledge that.  I believe in giving credit where it is due.  Deputy Spring was criticised unfairly by some of the Minister's colleagues and farm organisations, and I will deal with that.</P>
      <P>Changes have been made in regard to the enlargement clause and the income conditions for the scheme.  In order to have a meaningful scheme, those conditions must be removed.  The enlargement clause is a recipe for fragmentation rather than consolidation.  I would not credit a 12 year old child for introducing such a rule.  The rule that requires farmers to earn at least 50 per cent of their income from the farm should be scrapped.  I know a farmer who for eight or nine years derived more than 50 per cent of his income from the scheme, but because he got a job for one year and received social welfare benefit for a few months he did not qualify for the farm retirement scheme.  The extra £600 or £700 he received in that year meant he was not eligible.  A commitment was given to review the scheme under Partnership 2000, with the objective of making significant improvements to it.  While I acknowledge the Minister is doing good work in this regard, I hope the question of income is considered.  People should not be catapulted out of the scheme for the sake of a few pounds derived from social welfare benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are responsible citizens.  They recognise they are the guardians of the environment and that their actions will impact positively or adversely on future generations.  Despite the important nexus between pollution control and environmental protection and enhancement, <Col N="92" /> there is virtually no on-farm investment scheme in place.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up people frequently referred to the land project.  I did not know what that meant until one day a digger arrived and I realised reclamation work was about to take place.  Since then there has always been a scheme of State grants for on-farm investment and improvements.  The absence of the farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes and unfavourable tax treatment have impacted adversely on farmers' morale and dampened their self-initiative to invest their resources in farm improvements.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years farmers have made significant investment in farm buildings mainly to meet environmental standards.  The focus was environmental protection; it did not yield an increased income to the farm family.  Up to 26 per cent of farm income was invested in farm improvements in 1987.  In the programme for Government the Minister undertook to restore the CFP and to put in place a new scheme to encourage on-farm investments.  The control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes should be reintroduced as a matter of urgency and adequately funded.  A sum of £80 million to £90 million would be required for the reintroduction of those schemes.  The Minister should impress on the Government the need to examine the way capital allowances for investment in pollution control and animal welfare are treated under the taxation code.  He referred to a rate of 50 per cent.  The pollution control allowance should be increased to 100 per cent, be available in the first or any subsequent year as a free depreciation measure and be written off over a set period.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton stated, under the public capital programme, expenditure on agriculture and food will fall by more than 20 per cent this year.  When that is added to an estimated decline in farm related construction spending of approximately £80 million, jobs in the construction-contractor area will reduce by about 1,500.  I am aware of this through contacts I have had with a farm construction firm in my area.  People often ask who benefits from these schemes.  Farmers, building contractors, concrete and steel suppliers, the rural economy &mdash; farmers have a propensity to spend in their local shops &mdash; the Exchequer and the environment benefit.  A friend of mine from County Longford, who is fairly prominent in the ICMSA, has often stated that it is a win-win situation.  That is why the schemes should be reintroduced.  I believe some co-operatives will not pay farmers the bonus if they are not registered. That would have a significant impact on farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I recall what was said in this House about access to markets for livestock and beef.  I also recall meeting a number of dry stock farmers in the Red Cow Inn, many of whom I knew because I come from the hub of the dry stock industry. The past three winters, in particular, have been <Col N="93" /> difficult for dry stock farmers, especially those engaged in winter fattening.  An unequivocal commitment was given that if Deputy Spring was removed from Government, others would be on the next jet heading for Libya and Cairo to reopen those markets.</P>

      <P>I knew that was a blatant lie because it could not happen.  Nobody worked harder than Deputy Spring to try to reopen those markets, but there was an attempt to smear his efforts.  Perhaps some people wanted to settle a score with him.  Many Members of the House vilified him.  At one of the meetings in the Red Cow Inn I was asked by people, who may have wanted to embarrass me, what Deputy Spring was doing about the matter.  As Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture, I knew what he was doing.  I was as strongly committed to the reopening of those markets as anyone else.  I am proud to say I get a significant farming vote and always will because I stood by farmers in 1979 and 1980 and throughout my professional career as an agricultural consultant. That is why many people were shocked.</P>
      <P>I knew the commitments given at that time were only pie in the sky.  We depend on the provision of detailed technical information to those countries, supplemented by Government action and ministerial and diplomatic efforts to reopen the markets.  Ultimately, the decision to purchase the products rests with the Egyptian and Libyan authorities.  One would not think that from what was said at those meetings or here in the House by people who should know better.</P>

      <P>People asked me why Deputy Spring did not get on a jet and go to the countries involved, and this was purposely fed down the line.  Fortunately, I had a good relationship with the farmers in my county who knew the truth.  I always tell the truth and let the penny drop wherever it falls.</P>
      <P>Approximately nine out of every ten cattle we produce must be exported.  It is vital that all possible market outlets for live cattle and carcass meat are reopened without further delay.  We are a peripheral island nation which depends on suitable shipping arrangements to facilitate the export of livestock and meat.  The Government should seek to obtain special EU support for the provision of the necessary vessel facilities.  Freight carriers must obviously have due regard to animal welfare from the port of departure to the port of final destination.  The Minister referred to this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reopening of the live cattle trade with Libya and Egypt is extremely important to us.  It would also provide vital competition for meat <Col N="94" /> processors in terms of the price they pay farmers for their cattle.  On 30 May a parliamentary question tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked what he was doing to reopen those markets. He stated that he had personally written to the Libyan Minister for Foreign Affairs inviting him to send a delegation of senior officials to Ireland to discuss any remaining obstacles to the resumption of trade and that he looked forward to the arrival of such a delegation.</P>

    <Title>Urban Renewal Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost one third of all poor households live in public housing in our five main cities.  Secondly, there is evidence that residents of urban areas with high poverty concentrations experience cumulative disadvantage in terms of long-term unemployment, educational disadvantage and social isolation.  Thirdly, the quality of life in areas of urban disadvantage is significantly inferior to that in more affluent areas in terms of crime levels, drugs, environmental conditions and socio-economic features such as access to banks and shops, local business activity and the provision of recreational amenities.</P>
      <P>The Government's national anti-poverty strategy recognises that tackling poverty in Irish society cannot be left to social welfare mechanisms alone.  Intervention across a wide cross-section of public policy measures is required.  Disadvantage in urban areas is one of the five key themes of the anti-poverty strategy, with urban renewal identified as one of a number of policy actions which can contribute to achieving the objectives of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is critical, therefore, that urban renewal programmes for the future should identify the community gains arising from initiatives in this area, including measures to increase local employment, <Col N="95" /> support the development of the local economy, and provide for social housing and environmental improvements.</P>
    <P>After ten years' experience it was time to carry out a review, informed by an in-depth study, of the urban renewal schemes as they have operated up to now.  Such a study was commissioned from a team of consultants consisting of KPMG, Murray O'Laoire Architects and the Northern Ireland Research Centre.  The report from the consultants suggested that physical urban renewal can no longer be seen to operate in isolation.  The delivery of wider economic and social benefits under the scheme in future would require a more focused, integrated strategy.  The consultants stated that:</P>
    <P>Urban renewal must address the physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration of urban areas having regard to the local situation, the overall situation and any individual conditions.  As such, the diversity of issues urban renewal policy must address has led to the conclusion that, in the future, measures and programmes for renewal must be linked to area based, integrated strategic planning.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the recommendations from the consultants the key elements in the new approach to urban renewal which the Government has adopted are as follows:</P>
    <P>The new scheme will provide for a more targeted approach to the award of urban renewal incentives, both in terms of their scale and in the areas to which they will apply;</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme designations for urban renewal will be based on the concept of integrated area plans, which will address not only issues of physical development such as appropriate use, quality of design and conservation, but will also cover wider issues of local socio-economic benefit, including training, education and social housing;</P>
    <P>Integrated area plans will have to identify targeted, focused sub-areas for designation, justify the proposed designations by reference to the objectives of the plan and indicate the basis on which incentives are sought.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Government took office last year, I appointed an expert advisory panel to assist me in preparing for the new scheme.  The panel's terms of reference included the provision of advice on guidelines for identifying priority areas for which plans should be prepared and on the suggested content of the plans.</P>
    <P>The panel has also been asked to assess the extent to which completed plans comply with the guidelines with a view to making recommendations in relation to proposals for designation. Guidelines as finalised by the panel were subsequently issued to county councils and county borough corporations which were given responsibility for identifying and prioritising the most <Col N="96" /> appropriate areas for which plans might be prepared, having regard to the criteria laid down in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The criteria for selection of areas for which plans should be prepared included relevant development plan policies and objectives, the extent of physical decay and social and economic disadvantage in the area, the need for incentives to support development in the area and the capacity to benefit from such incentives, together with the potential for synergy with other area-based plans and programmes.</P>
    <P>On the important issue of the size of urban areas most likely to be suitable for consideration under the new scheme, the guidelines made the point that very few towns of less than 6,000 population had received designation under the schemes up to now and that such towns would be likely to have even greater difficulty qualifying under the criteria for the new scheme.  This indicative population level has been the subject of much debate since the guidelines were issued.</P>
    <P>The essential response I would make is that the guidelines did not seek to set a minimum population threshold, as such, for the new scheme. While the indicative population level mentioned does not equate to setting a strict population threshold, it reflects the fact that the scheme is concerned with urban renewal and that it must, therefore, of its nature, be confined to areas with strong urban characteristics.  The indicative population level also reflects the fact that the successful implementation of a scheme of this nature in an urban area requires a minimum level of scale.</P>
    <P>A number of requests to have the 6,000 population guideline reduced were received.  The issue was considered by the expert advisory panel as part of its overall consideration of the guidelines for the new scheme.  The panel's recommendation was that the 6,000 guideline should remain unchanged on the basis that while it is only a guideline, it provides a reasonable baseline indication of the minimum size of urban area likely to be able to meet the criteria for designation under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The designation of an area for tax reliefs under the new scheme can only be considered if it falls within an urban area which the relevant local authority decides is a priority area for which an integrated area plan has been prepared.  In that context, if a town with a population of less than 6,000 was considered to be a priority, the relevant local authority will, as in all other cases, have to demonstrate clearly how that area meets the criteria for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Turning to the content of integrated area plans, the guidelines for the new scheme make it clear that these plans should create a vision for the future of the area to which they relate which balances physical development, economic and community development, conservation and environmental and amenity improvements.  Within core urban areas, in particular, conservation of the built environment is expected to underpin the strategy of any plan for such an area. <Col N="97" /> The consultants' report on previous urban renewal schemes recognised that a number of excellent conservation initiatives had been undertaken in designated areas under the schemes operating up to now.  The report found that it was in those areas where conservation objectives have focused on the reinforcement of the essential character of an area that they have been most effective.</P>
    <P>However, in many designated areas the practice of conservation, according to the consultants, simply resulted in the gutting of buildings and the retention of facades.  This may have been variously attributable to the difficulties of complying with statutory building and fire regulations, the misfit between new uses and old buildings or the widely cited problem of cost.</P>
    <P>To facilitate reconstruction and improvement work on existing buildings, my Department has issued revised technical guidance on the national building regulations which took on board a number of suggestions from the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland.  The institute, in partnership with my Department, is currently working on a further special technical guidance document for work carried out on buildings of outstanding architectural and historical importance, including listed buildings.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme consultants also found there was a tendency to concentrate on the retention of isolated historical features and facades.  They were of the view that there is a need to evaluate the total spatial, social and historical context of each building in a streetscape. That is why the guidelines on the 1998 urban renewal scheme, which issued to local authorities, specifically addressed the issue of conservation and set out a basis on which the problems highlighted by the consultants' report might be addressed, taking account of best practice in terms of both building and streetscape conservation.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report also noted that, in the absence of a strategic policy on conservation at national level, it was not surprising there have been mixed results from conservation initiatives in designated areas.  Happily, since the time that report was published, the Government has made significant progress on the overall issue of building conservation, particularly with the publication last month by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, of the Government's proposals, entitled &ldquo;Protecting Our Architectural Heritage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These proposals will deliver on a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium by putting in place three significant measures.  The first of these consists of a proposed new planning Bill which will transform the legislative protection afforded to the architectural heritage.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will also bring forward a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on <Col N="98" /> a statutory basis.  The inventory will act as a crucial database in identifying buildings throughout the State which are worthy of protection.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am pleased that the Government has given approval for a new budget line of £5 million per annum from 1999 onwards to ensure that the package of measures can be fully implemented.  Out of this, around £4 million will be available for grant aid for protected buildings. The remainder will go on the third measure: employment of the necessary conservation expertise to ensure that all buildings worthy of listing are identified, the legislation enforced and the grants scheme operated effectively.  The employment of adequate expertise and knowledge by local authorities will be specifically supported with central guidance and support as necessary.</P>
    <P>The new conservation measures being introduced by the Government will closely complement and help to underpin the approach to conservation required under the integrated area planned approach to urban renewal.  There is strong emphasis in the guidelines for integrated area plans on preference for refurbishment of existing buildings for sustainable uses over new buildings.  Plans are expected to show how incentives can be used to support investment in conservation and repair and adaptation to new use.</P>
    <P>The Bill is directly linked with the provisions for tax reliefs for the new urban renewal scheme included in this year's Finance Act.  Those reliefs cannot be applied until after the Oireachtas has passed a Bill providing for the renewal of certain urban areas and the submission of integrated area plans in respect of areas identified on the basis of criteria drawn up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into four Parts.  Part I is made up of mainly technical provisions dealing with matters such as the Bill's commencement and definition of terms used in the Bill.  Part II deals with integrated area plans, including the functions of local bodies and the Minister in relation to these plans and deals with rates remissions.  Part III clarifies and extends certain additional functions to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which was established under the provisions of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997.  The opportunity is taken in Part IV to make specific statutory provision for the urban and village renewal grants which are made to local authorities and certain other conservation bodies under the urban and village renewal subprogramme of the EU co-financed Local Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme.  A number of amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, are also provided for in Part IV.  While these tax legislation provisions are included in this Bill the intention is to incorporate the provisions subsequently in the Taxes Consolidation Act via the 1999 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 6 deal respectively with the issues of the Bill's Short Title, various commencement <Col N="99" /> provisions, interpretation of terms used in the Bill, the linking of the Bill with the relevant provisions in the Finance Act, the appointment of authorised companies for the purposes of the Bill's provisions and the payment of any expenses that may be incurred by the Minister in administering the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the drawing up by county councils and county borough corporations or companies authorised by them of integrated area plans, IAPs, for a part or parts of their areas for the purposes of the new urban renewal scheme, with provision for the inclusion of part of the area of another county council or corporation, with the consent of the latter.  Section 7 also lists objectives which must or may be identified in an IAP.  These objectives include securing the economic and social renewal of the area and its physical renewal with provision for addressing the various issues relevant to the renewal of the area.  The section also requires consultation with a wide cross section of interests in the preparation of IAPs.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for IAPs to contain or be accompanied by recommendations from local authorities or authorised companies that parts of the area to which the plan relates should qualify for tax incentives or, alternatively, that the whole of the area to which a plan relates may qualify for some of the residential incentives in certain circumstances.  The provision allowing residential incentives to be applied throughout an area to which an IAP relates, where this can be justified, has been framed to take account of the recommendations in the Bacon report on house prices by confining this option to conversion or refurbishment of existing property in the case of section 23 type relief for rented residential accommodation and to residential property for owner occupation.  Section 23 type relief for new rented accommodation could only be applied in subareas within an IAP area where this can be justified.</P>
    <P>Section 8 goes on to provide that in recommending the application of incentives a local authority or authorised company must have regard to the following criteria: consistency between the types of development for which urban renewal reliefs are to be provided and relevant provisions of an integrated area plan; the significance of the reliefs to be provided in a qualifying area for overall development objectives of such a plan; market conditions in the area covered by the plan and the nature and extent of any impediments to the development of the type envisaged in the area in which the tax reliefs will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having considered an IAP, to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance that an area or areas within the area covered by an IAP should qualify for urban renewal incentives.  Section 10 allows rating authorities to remit on a sliding scale over <Col N="100" /> ten years the rates leviable on premises constructed or improved over a period to be specified, in an area covered by an IAP.  It should be noted that this provision would allow rating authorities to grant rates remissions on this basis in any urban area covered by an IAP regardless of whether tax reliefs are applied in the particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that developments qualifying for the tax reliefs must be consistent with the objectives of the relevant IAP, with local authorities providing certificates to this effect.  Section 12 covers the putting in place of arrangements for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of IAPs in cases where areas within the area covered by the plan become qualifying areas for the purposes of tax incentives.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, section 13 provides for the avoidance of doubt in response to legal advice given to the authority, that the DDDA may recommend to the Minister for Finance that one or more of the relevant incentives provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act may be applied to qualifying areas in the docklands area.  Section 14 provides that qualifying developments in docklands must be consistent with the master plan for that area and that this must be certified by the DDDA.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in section 15 to allow minor variations to the Dublin docklands master plan by the council of the DDDA to take account of any changed circumstances that may have arisen since the adoption of the plan without the need to invoke the full review procedure.  Section 16 increases the present limit on borrowing by the authority from £50 million to £100 million to reflect the major investment to be undertaken by the authority in implementing the master plan.</P>
    <P>Section 17 makes specific statutory provision for the grants payable under the urban and village renewal subprogramme of the Local Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme. Sections 18 and 19 contain the provisions which will be incorporated in the Taxes Consolidation Act at a later stage.  Section 18 will have the effect that double rent allowances for lessees of buildings can apply irrespective of whether capital allowances were granted on the building.  This is in line with the taxation provisions in relation to the new scheme under which the intention is that the Minister for Finance may direct that areas within the boundaries of an IAP shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of any one or more of the urban renewal tax incentives.</P>
    <P>There have been ongoing consultations with the European Commission on the future applicability of the urban renewal tax incentives in the case of the Custom House Docks area.  Arising from delays which have occurred in obtaining EU approval to an extension of the current deadline for the incentives and unexpected EU objections to certain aspects of the incentives as they have applied to development in the Custom House Docks area up to now, including double rent <Col N="101" /> allowances in particular, it has become necessary to modify legislative provisions relating to the incentives in that area.  The proposed modifications are provided for in section 19.  Specifically, section 19 extends, from 1 May 1998 to 1 August 1998, the deadline in section 409A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, by which a contract for the development of a building in the Custom House Docks area must be entered into if it is not to be affected by the £25,000 ceiling which has been placed on the amount of capital allowances which a passive individual investor can offset against non-rental income in any given year.</P>
    <P>Section 19 also provides for the following variations as between particular termination dates for the different tax reliefs in the area: 24 January 1999 for double rent allowances; 31 December 1999 for the residential reliefs; and 31 December 1999 for the capital allowances for the construction of commercial buildings.  However, where at least 51 per cent of the qualifying expenditure is incurred before 1 January 2000, the capital allowances qualifying period will be extended to 30 June 2000.  These changes will come into effect by way of an order to be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the EU Commission also has to be notified about any aspects of the new urban renewal scheme regarded as constituting State aids to business, i.e. the tax allowances and rates relief for commercial and industrial development.  Consultations have been taking place with the Commission about the extent to which, and the basis on which, EU approval may be forthcoming, in the context of the new regulations on regional aid published recently.  Having regard to the Commission's particular difficulties with double rent reliefs and with rates remissions, the position emerging in the light of the continuing consultations with the Commission may require me to revisit some of the provisions of this Bill and the relevant tax legislation provisions during later stages of debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The process of selecting areas and preparing IAPs has been ongoing since last year.  The total number of IAPs received by my Department was 78 &mdash; well beyond the 50 or so we anticipated. Given that the urban renewal scheme applies in 35 urban centres and the well signalled intention that the new scheme will be targeted at the areas where needs are greatest it is clear there will have to be limitations on the extent to which designation can be applied under the new scheme. Widespread and extensive designation would defeat the whole purpose of the new scheme. However, until such time as all the IAPs have been fully assessed by the expert advisory panel and recommendations made to me, no decisions will be announced.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on its provisions.</P>

      <P>I confess I have ambivalent feelings about this Bill.  I welcome its intention but the <Col N="102" /> Bill is one of the sloppiest pieces of drafting I have ever seen.  It is a masterpiece of uncertainty. There is no clarity about it.  It is a piece of ad hockery which is not worthy of the name Bill.  I predict it will cause problems for Ministers for the Environment in future years because it does not set out any basis that can be seized, understood, predicted or analysed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for making decisions on the applications for tax reliefs.  This Bill sets up a system, the worth of which is not in question, the success of which has been proven, following ten years of ad hockery on a new ad hoc basis and runs a serious risk of being challenged by some aggrieved local authority or individual who wants to construct in an area or involve himself in economic, infrastructural, social, employment improvements and so on in an area that has not been designated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the intention of the Bill which gives effect to a number of things which were set in train by the rainbow coalition Government and by my good friend and colleague, Deputy Howlin, when Minister for the Environment.  That so much of this Bill relates back to the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is an eloquent demonstration that something of this kind was in train and well on track before this.  It has come to a form of fruition now.  There would be no point in saying we will throw out this Bill but I hope the Minister will think again before Committee Stage and bring forward some amendments &mdash; I intend to propose some &mdash; that will give to this Bill, what should be one of the primary features of legislation of any kind and particularly legislation dealing with tax and development, clarity, certainty and predictability as to its effect and where the effect will take place.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been eagerly awaited.  Having read it and listened to the Minister I still do not know what to expect.  It provides for the preparation of integrated area plans by local authorities, envisages plans that might cover part of the area of more than one local authority, provides for recommendations to be made in respect of qualifying areas for the purpose of urban renewal tax reliefs and so on but does not give any idea of how widely these urban renewal tax reliefs will apply.  We are told 78 integrated area plans have been drawn up and submitted because this process has been going on for some time.  It was expected that about 50 would have been submitted. Perhaps the Minister will tell us if there are more to come.  Nobody knows how many will give rise to tax reliefs in any areas that are proposed for designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many of the 78 plans, drawn up and submitted, include a recommendation for an area or areas for the purposes of the tax reliefs.  When replying to the debate perhaps the Minister will tell us.  I have absolutely no doubt that whatever the number is, it will be more than <Col N="103" /> will be finally decided as qualifying for these tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance will have fun.  In this House and outside they will jointly have fun when it comes to explaining why areas proposed for designation are not designated. The Bill does not give us any means of understanding how or why the Ministers will make a decision.  It does not require either of the two Ministers to give any explanation or any reason for any decisions they might make, whether to grant the designated status.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has been in the House longer than I. He was in this House and I was outside on an occasion in, I think, 1968 when a Bill was found to be unconstitutional because it left far too wide a margin of decision for the Minister in question.  I am referring to the Livestock Marts Bill, 1968, and the then Minister for Agriculture was the late Deputy Neil Blaney.  He produced this Bill which appeared to everybody to be reasonable but it was challenged on the basis that there was nothing in it that required the Minister to act in a particular way in response to a given set of circumstances. The courts found that he had too wide a latitude in a matter that was of economic importance to the people who would apply for these livestock marts licences.  The Bill was declared to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the same fate awaits this Bill but I find nothing in it that allows anybody outside the offices of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance to know what will be the effect of it.  All the criteria written into the Bill, and all the jargon the consultants have produced, count for nothing.</P>
    <P>I smiled when I heard the Minister of State outline some of the findings of the consultants.  He stated: &ldquo;The quality of life in areas of urban disadvantage is significantly inferior to that in more affluent areas in terms of crime levels, drugs, environmental conditions and socio-economic features such as access to banks and shops, local business activity and the provision of recreational amenities&rdquo;.  I invite the Minister to take a walk some day in Neilstown, Rowlagh or Cabra because people living in those areas will tell him about their quality of life far more pithily than these consultants.  That is what was in the mind of Brendan Behan's father when he was reported to have said, on being told they were allocated a house in the then new housing estate of Crumlin, that he did not want to move there because &ldquo;they ate their young out there&rdquo;.  It did not cost him £300 per hour to come up with that piece of insight.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is being very casual about all of this.  In his concluding remarks he said, in a somewhat throwaway fashion, that widespread and extensive designation would defeat the whole purpose of the new scheme.  If everybody is privileged <Col N="104" /> then nobody is privileged, but where does one draw the line?  Where will the line be drawn between the advantages to be given by the designated status in the Bill and the areas where that will not apply?  That was the core of this Bill, along with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the &ldquo;treble DA&rdquo; as the Minister calls it.  That sounds like a radio station somewhere in the United States.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill is the tax provisions.  The integrated area plans will count for nothing where there is not designation because the Bill even provides for local authority staff to monitor the progress of those plans.  What will they monitor? They have to produce written reports for the Minister, but do they have any powers?  For example, in the year 2000, will they write to the Minister stating that he introduced an integrated area plan in 1998 and was good enough to designate part of an area for tax reliefs but that in every area, except where tax reliefs apply, the integrated area plan came to nothing because they were not given the necessary power or resources to do anything?  Will they recommend that the integrated area programme they submitted to the Minister in 1998 should be discontinued because they cannot implement it?  It is nonsense to provide for that type of measure in legislation unless it has some meaning.  It does not have any meaning in this case.  The Bill is concerned only with the designation of urban areas for the tax reliefs provided and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Some difficulty will arise in figuring out what happens to recommendations.  Recommendations in respect of designation will first have to go to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  That Minister has to decide which recommendation to follow up.  That Minister has to decide which of these proposals he or she will recommend to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance then has to decide which of these meritorious applications, sponsored by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be given effect.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be of this mind also &mdash; will want as many of these proposals as possible to succeed.  The Minister for Finance, on the other hand, will be concerned about the erosion of the tax base.  Regardless of how friendly they may be, they will not agree on this matter.  Which of them will win?  What will happen if the Minister for Finance chooses certain proposals and rejects the others?  The Minister for Finance may explain it to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, but who will explain it to the public?  Who will explain it to the local authority that made the recommendation or to the people who would like to be involved in development in what was proposed to be a designated area?  I do not know the answer to that question and the Bill does not tell us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear because each Minister for the Environment and each Minister for Finance who operates the Bill will be making an arbitrary decision.  Unless all of the proposed designations are given effect in accordance with the criteria in the Bill, the Ministers will choose them and they will have to have regard to criteria other than those set out in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically, Ministers will have regard to the amount of tax expenditure included in this measure.  The Minister for Finance will want to reduce the erosion of the tax base and the Minister for the Environment will want to increase it, and no amount of waffle and fancy footwork in the Bill will change that.  It does not mean anything.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of work still to be done. That applies to Dublin, apart from the docklands area.  It applies to the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  What are the chances that recommendations in respect of designations will be accepted in those cities?  If they are accepted, how extensive will they be?  It does not stop with those cities.  Any Member in this House could name any number of towns where there are substantial redevelopment needs &mdash; Sligo, Wexford, Ennis, Naas, Mallow, Cobh, Thurles, Tipperary, Athlone or Mullingar.  There is not one town where a good case cannot be made for redevelopment of part of the town.</P>
      <P>I amused myself last night by putting the names of even smaller towns in alphabetical order.  I came up with Athy, Ballyhaunis, Carndonagh, Dungarvan and so on.  All of these towns will produce meritorious cases.  This measure could be applied to umpteen towns around the country with populations of 6,000 or more.  Why was the figure of 6,000 chosen?  Why not 7,000 or 5,000? Somebody decided that 6,000 was the magical threshold but we were told if it causes a problem it could be more or less than that, but 6,000 is a general guideline.  That is not the way to legislate.</P>
      <P>Other strange things have happened.  In my own county of Kildare, for example, the local authority was given to understand that it should propose three towns for designation and, if it did, one of them would be likely to be accepted.  In a commendable exercise of their wisdom and judgment, the members of Kildare County Council unanimously decided that they would propose the towns of Kilcock, Kildare and Athy.  In addition, they said that in their view, and taking account of the development needs of the county, they would like Athy to be the town that is designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a wise and commendable decision and I understand something similar happened in other counties.  However, they do not know what the result will be and there is nothing in the Bill <Col N="106" /> to indicate any means of discerning it.  They would be as well off doing what the Romans did &mdash; killing a chicken and examining its entrails &mdash; to try to find out the result as they would be examining this Bill.  There is nothing in it which states whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will accept the recommendations and, if he were to do so, whether the Minister for Finance will agree to them.  Neither does it state whether, if both agreed to them, there would be too many to which they would have agreed for matters to proceed.  The Minister stated that if everyone is privileged then no one is privileged.  We do not know what the result will be.  The Bill should be redrafted to become legislation worthy of the name in that it would set out clearly to do something and say how it would be done.  It does not do that, nor I do not expect that to happen.</P>
    <P>If the Minster introduced the Bill and the palaver of Second, Committee and other Stages was proceeded with, what would happen if either House had the temerity to change anything? What would happen if a substantial change were made to section 7 which details what the integrated area plans should contain?  If such changes were made as a result of the Minister having a rush of blood to the head and accepting Opposition amendments, would that make all the 78 plans submitted so far ineligible for consideration? Would it mean we would have to start again?  What would happen if the House decided to change the dates in section 2?  We are being invited to debate a Bill concerning a scheme already up and running and about which certain substantial decisions have already been made. The Minister hopes we will agree to the Bill and he commends it to the House.  However, if we change anything, it will create a headache for him because it would undo a great deal.  That is no way to run a railway.  That is not legislation as it should be practised.</P>
    <P>There is another area the Bill does not clarify. Does the Minister intend to give any guidelines, directions or suggestions about the balance between commercial and residential development in the integrated area plans envisaged in the Bill? I am not familiar with the 78 plans submitted so far so I do not know what the balance is in these plans.  The Minister might be tempted to tell me that it is a matter for the local authorities or the companies which prepare these plans, that he will give free rein to local autonomy in this matter &mdash; something I have always argued for &mdash; and he would be entitled to say that.  However, that will not wash.  What emerges clearly from the report on the past ten years of designation is that commercial development is by far the most attractive form.  After that comes residential development in the form of blocks of modest apartments.</P>
    <P>The results of that can be seen in a number of towns and cities around the country.  Many of the apartments which have been built in towns which have benefited from this kind of tax relief are of a kind &mdash; and I will be as delicate as I can in <Col N="107" /> describing them &mdash; which are suitable for occupation by people on local authority housing lists, both lone parent and two parent families, and who receive rent allowances from their local health boards.  Those people need accommodation and I am always delighted they can get it. However, urban renewal tax reliefs, where they are granted &mdash; I would like the Minister to explain the section 23 matter more clearly &mdash; should not be mainly concentrated, either by accident or design, on providing a halfway house type of accommodation to deal with local authority housing problems.  That is what many of the residential developments involved are or have become.</P>
    <P>While there is a place and a need for that type of development which may be interfered with by action taken on foot of the Bacon report, in practice it means there are areas in a number of towns which are inhabited substantially by &mdash; again I pick my words carefully &mdash; a transient population of people who are living there but do not want to be there and would rather be somewhere else but for the fact that it is the only accommodation accessible to them.  That is not fair to them or their neighbours.  The centres of towns should be occupied by people who have a need to be there, such as elderly people, retired people, people with mobility impairments, because they need to be near the facilities of a town more than they need the peace, tranquillity and isolation of the countryside.  The centres of towns should also be inhabited by people who want to live near their place of work or business.  It is time to rethink the kind of residential development which should be stimulated by these tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>That applies particularly to city centre areas for the reasons I have stated and for another reason. We should aim to stimulate the development of residential accommodation in city centre areas for people across the income bracket.  That should be done to counteract or offset in part the daily mass migration from the peripheries into the centre in the morning and from the centre to the peripheries in the evening.  It would redress the balance by having people living in the centre and working at the periphery so that some kind of efficiency in the use of public transport and road space could be obtained.</P>
    <P>That should be foremost in our minds when we examine developments such as the Dublin docklands development.  I am not familiar with what is being proposed in the docklands but I would lay £1,000 to a hayseed, as a former colleague of mine and Deputy Howlin's used to say, that it will be mostly commercial.  I believe it should be mostly residential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be higher than what exists at the moment and it should be for a mix of income brackets.  We should avoid the ghettoisation <Col N="108" /> of the docklands for any group, privileged or underprivileged.</P>
      <P>It is not just a problem in Dublin.  Many Members have experience of gridlock in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Wexford, not to speak of Enniscorthy and Gorey.  Congestion is a problem in every major city and town and in every town which has not been by-passed and through which a trunk road is routed.  I have spent a half hour getting from one side of Mitchelstown to the other, even using the rat run recently elevated to the status of an official diversion. Such congestion arises because there are huge volumes of traffic and people on the move and because we do not have an urban development policy which focuses on the problem.  We now have an Urban Renewal Bill which does not seem to recognise that the problem exists.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Bill envisages modifications to the master plan prepared by the authority as long as they are not &ldquo;modifications which would substantially alter the nature of the plan&rdquo;.  I do not understand why we should be so restrictive.  If the nature of the plan can be substantially altered to make it more people friendly and traffic friendly, why not alter it?  If it can be altered under the breadth of a flawed inspiration such as this Bill, we should go ahead and alter it.  What is so special about it that it should be immutable?  I will mention something which is not in the Bill but which could have a substantial bearing on the success of the enterprise of which the Bill is a part.  This Bill is designed to assist in the renewal of urban areas &mdash; cities, towns and villages.  Other developments are being planned which might go in the opposite direction.  My understanding is that up to recently the Minister of State intended to put a cap on the size of large shopping centre developments, particularly supermarkets.  I understand that he had in mind a cap in the nature of 4,000 square metres gross area or 3,000 square metres net area. However, my information is that certain developers have been whispering in the Taoiseach's ear and he seems to be disposed towards taking a bigger view and allowing even bigger superstores on the edges of towns and cities.  That would be a great mistake which would go against the intentions of this Bill.  If we allow superstores to be built on the edges of towns they will suck business out of the towns and no amount of integrated area plans will be able to withstand that process.  The Minister of State should take courage, ignore the siren songs of those trying to change the Taoiseach's mind and announce a maximum 4,000 square metres size for out of town superstores.</P>

We have an opportunity to modify and curb this process and prevent it happening in new areas.  I would be delighted to find that the Minister of State has done something which has that effect.

      <P>The Minister of State referred to measures being taken to protect our architectural heritage and I am delighted that such measures are being taken.  I hope this will see the end of a process which has been taking place.  Up to now the worst thing one could do if one owned a property with a heritage building was to try to preserve it.  If one owned such a property the best thing to do was to let it decay and not be disturbed.  If the building became dangerous enough the Office of Public Works might do something about it. However, if the owner tried to preserve the property the Office of Public Works would be down like a ton of bricks demanding perfection.  I hope that the measures mentioned by the Minister of State will involve a more sensible approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin on a more positive note than Deputy Dukes.  It may be a result of my time as Minister for the Environment but I am a fan of the concept of urban renewal and I will make some detailed comments on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I preface my remarks by signalling my support for urban renewal.  The history of urban renewal schemes is a story of success.  One can look at the <Col N="110" /> various models piloted in Dublin.  The Custom House Docks and Temple Bar are two different types of development which were under the wing of the Department.  There are also the various urban renewal schemes which have transformed areas up and down the country.  When people reflect on the decay which characterised the heart of many towns ten years ago they cannot but applaud the rejuvenation and the new spirit which has come with urban renewal and the schemes put in place.</P>
    <P>Not all schemes have been equally successful. Some dreadful decisions have been made.  I have seen some towns in which it was decided to abandon the run down urban heartland, designate a green field area and build a parallel town centre. Such decisions are bizarre.</P>
    <P>The initial schemes were slow to take off.  One needs some vibrancy in the economy and available investment resources for investors to take advantage of tax driven schemes such as this.  One need look no further than Wexford.  Anyone who has seen the 1798 commemorations in Wexford town or Enniscorthy will be flabbergasted at the transformation.  Enniscorthy has a particularly beautiful location in the Slaney Valley.  It has changed its perspective by developing areas that focus on the river when in the past most towns and cities focused away from rivers, the sea and natural amenities.  Two new hotels have been built in Enniscorthy &mdash; one is a magnificent promenade by the river and the other regenerates an area which has been derelict for as long as I remember.  It is almost as if these sorts of kick starts are contagious.  One can see other people, even in non-designated areas, uplifting, building and transforming areas of decay into thriving commercial and domestic areas.</P>
    <P>The concept has been good.  However, it is timely to fundamentally reappraise it.  We are in a vibrant period of investment and there is a great deal of money to be made in construction and the regeneration of urban dereliction for commercial usage or for private dwellings.  I was told that a great number of the submissions made to me as Minister would not have been made without the carrot of designation but quite often, when the carrot was not forthcoming, the investment still happened and a handsome profit was made.</P>
    <P>We should not continue the policies, successful though they have been.  That is the reason Deputy McManus and I, when Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal and Minister respectively, decided to commission a study of the urban renewal schemes to date.  KPMG, in association with Murray O'Leary Associates and the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre, was asked to look at the balance sheet to date and to give us pointers on how we should move forward and maintain the momentum for change at the least possible cost to the taxpayer but with the right effect.  This Bill has its genesis in the comprehensive report made available to the Government in December 1996.  It makes important reading.  It details the reaction of those <Col N="111" /> who have benefited from designation, analyses the economic inputs and indicates how we should move forward.</P>
    <P>In the ten year period 1986-95 more than £1.75 billion was invested in the designated areas.  Outside of Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area, £515 million was invested in Dublin and £742.8 million throughout the rest of the country. This had a positive effect in terms of residential and commercial development.</P>
    <P>The less positive views are contained in the chapters dealing with community development and the consequences for social development. The Minister of State said: &ldquo;The objective now will be to ensure the benefits of urban renewal accrue to the many poorer communities in disadvantaged urban areas, not just to developers, investors and new residents&rdquo;.  I am heartened by this.  Many people have made money out of these schemes.  This was necessary to bring our cities and towns back to life but I am not in favour of throwing apples into an orchard.  We have to be careful in providing tax support for developers who are already doing well in the current economic climate.  They do not need to be primed with taxpayer's money.  I agree with Deputy Dukes that the proof of the pudding is in the eating but at least a close analysis is signalled.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>It is stated on page 117 of the report that there is a high level of dissatisfaction among the representative community organisations with the consultation process to date.  The following is stated on page 116:</P>
    <P>It is the broad perspective of the organisations that the urban renewal schemes have failed to target the benefits of urban renewal towards local people.  ..Since 1986 some urban communities in or adjacent to designated areas have experienced increasing long-term unemployment, escalating rates of crime and drug abuse and the alienation of young people in spite of the level of private sector investment attracted to the areas due to the availability of tax incentives.  It is recognised that one must look beyond the tax based urban renewal schemes for the root of these problems and for solutions.  This was the initial failure at the inception of the process to take account of the wider reality in which the urban renewal scheme initiatives were introduced.  The stated objectives of the urban renewal schemes were to halt the decline in the physical fabric of our inner city areas by encouraging the private sector to undertake redevelopment schemes in these areas and to bring our inner cities back to life in terms of young people living in the city.  These objectives have largely been achieved.  However, the indigenous and adjacent communities feel that something is missing and that urban renewal, as defined by the incentive schemes, has not addressed issues which are central to the regeneration and sustainability of these areas such as employment, the lack of public amenities, education, training and youth development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> I am not as sceptical as Deputy Dukes yet but if that is where the Minister of State wants to go &mdash; he has clearly signalled that it is &mdash; not to prime already well primed pumps but to look at how social exclusion can be tackled, I wholeheartedly welcome it.  I agree that in consultants' reports there is jargon which jars on most people's nerves &mdash; that if one hits the right buttons, all will be well in terms of social exclusion &mdash; but it is clear from the key conclusions listed in chapter 15 of the report that there is a need for an integrated strategic plan with an area based focus involving local communities with emphasis on employment, education, training and so on.  These are covered in section 7(6) of the Bill.  The local authorities have been informed that, if they wish to submit an integrated plan to the Department, these are the areas that are deemed to be of critical importance.</P>
    <P>There are a number of deficiencies, to some of which I have contributed.  For example, it was a mistake to give sole and exclusive responsibility to county councils and county boroughs. Although the scheme is confined to urban areas, many county councils have submitted their integrated development plans with minimal consultation with the urban areas affected.  I am sorry I did not ensure there was a partnership approach with the county council as the lead agency.  Often there are tensions and jealousy between county and urban authorities.  The best product does not come from this.  The role of urban authorities should have been stronger in the preparation of integrated development plans.  I do not know if there is a means by which the Minister of State can require compulsory dialogue with the urban authorities affected whose imprimatur should be required before an integrated development plan is accepted and finalised.</P>
    <P>The second deficiency lies in the objective of ensuring greater transparency in the designation of areas for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is correct; if one reads through the Bill, there is a semblance of all sorts of structures. It provides these are the matters that must be considered, this is the mechanism by which an integrated development plan is to be constructed, these are the dates by which it must be done, these are the channels through which it is to be submitted and it will be vetted by a panel. However, there is precious little transparency in the Bill because there is no constraint on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government designating as they please.  As long as they are considering the integrated plans, they can pick one or 70 of them.  They can decide and the criterion which they apply to the selection process is known only to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State informed us tonight that 78 integrated area plans have been received in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  That does not surprise me.  I would have expected more because since the last scheme was closed up to 70 applications had been <Col N="113" /> received in the Department from urban authorities seeking extensions of existing schemes or new areas to be included in a new scheme.  Those applications have been on the shelf for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with how the selection mechanism is to apply.  Deputy Dukes stated there will be no transparency in it.  From my reading of the Bill the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance will make that determination after due process, but there is no court of appeal and any urban area not included in the ministerial final selection has no criterion by which to judge itself against the successful candidates.  That is the position at a time when the Minister for Education and Science is struggling to ensure there will be transparency in marking leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations and exam forms can be returned to students to show them where they made mistakes.  The lack of transparency in decision making is a fundamental issue in the Bill.  Decisions will be made by Ministers against a backdrop of criteria which are known only to the Ministers and in respect of which there is no court of appeal or mechanism for comparison.  I regard that as something that does not move us forward from the criticisms of previous schemes that were said to be at the sole discretion of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is not the point I am making.  The decisions will be made locally and the Department will receive 78 submissions, but whether one, five, 25 or 70 of those&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we have that number is that some local authorities did not choose to prioritise the town in which they wanted the IAP located.  They submitted a number of towns and the Minister must now decide on the matter.  The local authorities were asked to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately there will be a selection process decided by the Ministers, but it will not be made against the backdrop of discernible criteria and it will not be done in a transparent way.  The Minister of State might confound me by telling me about the way it will happen, but I would be surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another great criticism, and I referred to the report on the analysis and study of the urban renewal schemes to date, was the lack of local consultation.  People believed those schemes were decided on high and that there was no consultation between local communities and even local authorities.  Only a minimum amount of consultation with the public seems to be envisaged under Part II, section 7(7).  Under that section local authorities may consult whomsoever they choose.  There will not be a statutory requirement for a public consultation.  In the area of planning <Col N="114" /> there is a statutory requirement for display, consultation and amendment before anything can be finalised and that should be the way we proceed, but that is not true in the case of urban renewal. It can impact on a town as much as any development plan.  A development plan by nature is aspirational, whereas an urban renewal scheme is a practical document.  Often developers are keyed up and ready to proceed within the tight parameters of time for which the incentives apply. We should have paralleled the normal development plan procedure with a compulsory public consultation mechanism, but that is not in the Bill.  There is a tokenism about public consultation, which is a major deficiency in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some comments by the Minister of State which caused me some concern.  He mentioned the ongoing dialogue between the Department and the European Commission. Although it is not spelt out in any great detail, there is enough mention of it for me to be alarmed.  The Minister of State signalled he might even have to come back to the House before the Bill is enacted to amend it if, as I read between the lines, the consultations do not go well.  The Commission is considering the issue of tax incentives here, I presume in the context of our tiger economy, and, I take it, is anxious that aid to business is not contrary to European competition law.  If that is the case, the Minister of State should be upfront with the House on this matter. When he or the Minister concludes Second Stage tomorrow, I would like to be given a clear exposition of exactly what is happening.  I would like to know the views of the Commission on this and where the negotiations stand.  Are the benefits we put in place for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in any jeopardy?  I regard it as one of the flagship Bills I had the privilege to bring before this House.  The Minister and Deputy Dukes had some difficulty referring to it as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority or the DDDA.  The Oireachtas put provision in the Bill for the authority to come up with its own name.  We looked through a list of names to decide whether it would be called Docklands, Liffeyland or some other name that would be more user friendly than the DDDA.  I hope that will happen in due course.  I also hope that development, which will characterise the future of Dublin into the new millennium, will not be jeopardised by any ongoing discussions.</P>
    <P>I wish to amplify another extremely important point.  We should stop looking at development in isolation.  We keep doing that in this country.  We tend to think what is good for a town without considering it in the context of even the county. We tend to think what is good for our little area of the town.  We look at microcosms, not the broader picture.  We have no national spatial plan or development strategy in terms of urban development and growth.  I am convinced that will be an extremely important concept to put in force, if we are not to be choked by our own success in the years to come.  Dublin cannot continue <Col N="115" /> to grow, like Topsy, and developers wishing to site here cannot do so without regard to infrastructural problems.</P>
    <P>We do not have a national plan which outlines the urban growth centres over the next 20 or 25 years.  We tried to produce one 25 years ago but it was not fixed in law.  It is critically important that is now done.  The legislation should be anchored by a national blueprint of spatial planning outlining the infrastructural growth for transport, water supply, sewage treatment etc., which will enable growth centres of X population to develop over the next ten or 15 years.  Development, business and industry should be funnelled to those growth centres to allow the country and its regions thrive in a measured, structured manner rather than having some areas impoverished and others choking on unplanned overdevelopment.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the traffic volumes envisaged by the DTI for 2005 were reached last year.  What will happen when we reach 2005 if growth continues at 8 per cent?  We must decide on a spatial plan. This involves taking broad based decisions which will be extremely important and discarding for a little while our parochial views on these matters. I say this with as much conviction as I can as it is an extremely important issue in the context of the Bill and the ongoing general review of planning.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there should be wholesale redesignation in the context of advantage and helping areas.  I know the 78 applicants will lobby the Minister and every Member and that all will expect to receive designation.  There is nothing more attractive for a Minister than being able to deliver the goods by telling areas they have been redesignated.  However, the more areas designated, the more the Exchequer is impoverished through tax foregone and the less impact the designation has as the same pool of investor money is being chased by different centres.  Designation must be socially driven and integrated in a real sense and not simply aspirationally through paying lip service to the concept of an integrated social policy.  It must involve the local community from the start in discussion and planning in a way not envisaged and not provided for in the Bill. Integrated development should look at the indigenous population and embrace the concepts of outreach and education.  If the integrated plans achieve this they will do a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a former colleague, the cornerstone of whose address during a general election was that when he was elected to the House only 7 per cent of County Wexford was disadvantaged but that, after one term, he had ensured that nearly 20 per cent was disadvantaged.  In most countries this would not be a great boast. However, the notion of extending disadvantage to bring in grants seems a positive attribute in Ireland.  I hope the Minister will not go down the road of seeking to broad stroke the disadvantaged as much as possible to ensure everybody can claim some political credit while nobody receives any real benefit.</P>

      <P>I believe in the concept of urban renewal.  It has a proud history of achievement, although there have been some flaws and failures.  I support the plan which I and Deputy McManus as Minister of State commissioned which is the genesis and core of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to take heed of the points and deficiencies I have alluded to and hope he will be willing and amenable to accepting amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  Designation should be done in a transparent, narrow, focused manner to ensure the achievement of the social objectives which the Minister said in his speech are crucial to the next round of urban renewal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Like Deputy Howlin, I am a supporter of urban renewal.  I congratulate Deputy Molloy on introducing the Bill and am very glad a legal framework is being provided for a new urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal schemes were first introduced in 1986 in response to the increasing problem of dereliction and dilapidation in many major towns and cities.  The main objective of the scheme was to promote urban renewal and redevelopment in towns by promoting investment by the private sector in the construction and reconstruction of buildings in designated areas.  A further scheme was introduced in 1994.  In my constituency a small portion of Ballinasloe was designated under the last scheme and I saw the development in that area.  Urban renewal schemes have also benefited Galway city.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is talking about the designation of other areas, particularly areas of need. The schemes had a significant effect in addressing widespread dereliction and have led to the rejuvenation of areas which had fallen into decline or disuse.  There is strong evidence to suggest the schemes led to significant growth in the economic activity of town centres and enhanced tourism.  It is also clear that they contributed significantly to the atmosphere and confidence of designated areas.</P>
      <P>Despite the success of the schemes, a high powered consultants' report highlighted that in terms of architecture there were mixed results while on the social side there has been less success in terms of benefit to local people.  The new scheme envisaged in the Bill will feature a much more focused and integrated approach and will be underpinned by an objective to see physical renewal contributing to social renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill obliges local authorities &mdash; county councils, county boroughs and corporations &mdash; and authorised companies to prepare integrated area plans for socio-economic and physical renewal of urban areas.  It is envisaged that drawing up these integrated area plans will involve <Col N="117" /> widespread consultation at local level across a broad spectrum of interested groups.  In my constituency Galway County Council has consulted widely, something I can give many examples of. Local authorities have been responsible for preparing overall plans, a very good idea as they know what is happening in each county.  Application to the scheme of tax relief, catered for under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, must be compliant with the terms of local plans which put a stronger emphasis than was previously the case on social and environmental impact.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be empowered under the Bill to make grants to the responsible local authorities or other bodies concerning conservation and renewal of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provision concerning the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  In a special incentive aimed at specific inner city renewal, a double tax allowance is to be provided for newly constructed or refurbished buildings in the Dublin docklands or similar qualifying area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment of the House this evening.  Since the late 1970s, Athy and its hinterland have suffered an extraordinary decline in manufacturing industry.  Approximately 150 jobs were lost through the closure of Irish Board Mills, 100 jobs through the closure of the IVI factory, 25 jobs through the closure of Pymah Ltd., 50 jobs through the closure of Sherwood Medical and 30 jobs through the closure of PMPA.  Substantial job losses also occurred in a number of other plants such as Greencore, Bord na Móna, Euro-west, Peerless Rug, Borden International and Hickey Fabrics due to redundancies or company restructuring.  It now seems that Borden International may reduce its workforce by anything up to 20 employees.  No town and its hinterland can sustain this dramatic haemorrhaging of job losses.</P>
      <P>The workforce of this area of south Kildare has met the challenges posed by all types of industry from heavy to precision and highly skilled.  It has never been found wanting in any regard and no personnel problems were experienced in any of the cases mentioned.  The area has the necessary workforce and structure for further development given its proximity to Tallaght Regional Technical College, new infrastructure within the county, accessibility to NUI, Maynooth and all Dublin universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking a commitment from the Minister that she will actively pursue new industry for <Col N="118" /> the area to ensure this employment black spot is reactivated to its mid-1970 status when employment in the area was substantially better than it is now.  At a recent meeting with members of Athy UDC, the Minister promised that a survey of unemployed people in the area would be carried out.  Subsequent to that, in reply to a letter from me, the Minister stated this position was being investigated.  Can the Minister inform me whether this survey will be carried out and, if so, when that will happen?  An urgent decision must be taken to carry out such a survey in order that prospective employers are armed with valuable information to assist them in the possible selection of Athy as a base.</P>
    <P>Athy has the potential to develop; it is a heritage town which is currently seeking urban renewal status.  The town has witnessed a major residential upsurge and has excellent schools and water and sewerage services.  I urge the Minister and the relevant State agencies to actively pursue prospective industries for Athy to ensure that it and its hinterland regain their former status and does not continue to suffer the kind of employment haemorrhaging which has marked them as an industrial black spot in a county where the overall picture is a promising one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, attracting industry and employment to a particular part of the country is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department.  The agencies are committed to securing new investment for Athy and every effort is being made to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The difficulties encountered in Athy have been exacerbated by the recent announcement of the closure of Borden International, a can factory. The closure of this company has led to the establishment of a forum for Athy.  Membership of the forum includes local community representatives, trade representatives, Local authority members for the area and the State agencies.  The forum has now established two sub groups which will examine aspects of the forum's development brief.  First, the forum will examine the feasibility of providing an enterprise centre in Athy.  This will examine how the infrastructure can be provided locally to promote small industry development. This group consists of representatives from the county enterprise board, Athy UDC, FÁS and Forbairt.  Second, the forum will look at ways to create an environment to promote employment opportunities in Athy.  The membership of this group is made up of representatives of Athy UDC, Athy Chamber of Commerce, Athy Community Council and IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Forbairt has prioritised Athy as a location for mobile investment in the food and natural resources sectors and a number of investment itineraries to Athy town and its environs have been organised recently in order to promote Athy for such investment.  Forbairt is also working <Col N="119" /> closely with the local authorities in the area to ensure there are suitably serviced sites and other facilities for the visiting companies.</P>
    <P>The former Sherwood building in Athy is being promoted by both IDA Ireland and Forbairt and is attracting a lot of interest from a number of potential investors.  In a more general sense, I would emphasise the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure appropriate priority is given to encouraging industrial development in the regions.  I intend to ensure the development agencies carry out their remit in this regard and I believe this is characterised by the number of new jobs announced outside the Dublin area since this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>Apple Computer's plant in Cork is located on the north-west side of the city in the Holyhill-Knocknaheeny area.  I live in the shadow of the plant and am acquainted with many of its workers and their families who are very concerned at the recent speculation about the plant.</P>
      <P>The plant has served Cork well, having rescued the city from the economic doldrums following the trauma of industrial closures in the early 1980s.  As an industrial plant, it boasts a proud record of top class local management and a bright, well educated and committed workforce. We are often told it is the jewel in Apple's worldwide network of plants.  Against this background comes the recent speculation about the printed circuit board division in the plant.  To date, the speculation has been met with stony silence from all quarters and this is having a very serious effect on the morale of some of the workforce and their families.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we have a duty to ask necessary questions without fanning the flames of fear and oppression.  Can the Minister inform the House whether the printed circuit board unit is at risk and, if so, how serious the situation is for the well-being of the overall plant?  Are discussions ongoing between the Minister's Department and Apple Computer and is the Minister adopting a hands-on role in the process?  What is the Minister's assessment of the current situation and has the company discussed its long-term strategy with her?  The air should be cleared on this matter sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister and her Department the best of luck in their efforts and I pledge my total co-operation and support in this matter.  Apple's workforce and the people of Cork expect every effort to be made to address this problem.  The workers and their families must not become the passive victims of any cheap Far Eastern labour policy which the company may be considering.  I would welcome any light the Minister may be able to shed on the speculation which is rife in Cork in regard to this matter.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Kelleher.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this matter and I concur with his comments.  We all understand the complexities and competitiveness involved in globalisation and the shifting of business towards cheaper labour markets in the Far East.</P>
      <P>There is great concern in Cork at present.  Not only are the temporary workers in Apple concerned as a result of the speculation and rumours, but the fact that no clear statement has been made to date is increasing that concern.  If the 500 jobs in Apple Computer are lost, other companies which have contracts with the plant will also suffer and that will have a great impact on Cork city.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Tánaiste has met with representatives of Apple Computer.  However, she must use everything in the remit of the Government, her office and IDA Ireland to impress on the people who are due to make these decisions the importance of Apple Computer in the industrial, economic and social life of Cork.  We owe a great deal both to the company for providing a huge amount of employment in Cork over many years and to the workforce which has served the company well.  It would be most regrettable if the loss of these 500 jobs were announced without every resource available to Government and the various job creation agencies being used to retain them.</P>
      <P>The pressure on companies to make profits has resulted in the removal of labour intensive industries to cheaper labour locations in the Far East. However, this development could have a devastating effect not only on the immediate Cork area but in the general economy.  That must be recognised, acknowledged and tackled in the future.  I wish the Tánaiste and IDA Ireland the best of luck in their efforts to ensure that this speculation is ended.</P>

I share their concern about any threat to the jobs in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apple Computer was established in Cork in 1980 to manufacture PCs.  This is a highly integrated manufacturing operation which includes purchasing, printed circuit board &mdash; PCB &mdash; assembly, product assembly and test, localisation and distribution as well as software quality assurance, research and development.  Apple has been experiencing problems in the marketplace as a result of competitors providing cheaper comparable products.  To meet this challenge it has undertaken major rationalisation by selling plants in the US to SCI, plants in Singapore to NatSteel <Col N="121" /> and closing Appledom in Europe.  It made Cork the centre for PCB and relocated the Appledom activity to Hollyhill, Cork.</P>
    <P>Apple announced profits of US$47 million for the first quarter of 1998 and revenues of US$1.6 billion.  It continues to rationalise its product line and plans to have four major product lines, a reduction from 15.  The Powermac G3 is the first of these lines and it has been successfully launched.  It helped to make the first quarter profitable. Apple Corporation is also expected to return profits for the second quarter of 1998.  It has streamlined its products and structure and it is at present deciding the structure and strategy for this area.</P>
    <P>Some months ago Apple announced the total wind-down of its software subsidiary, Claris, with the loss of 100 jobs in Dublin and the intention to transfer some of those activities to Apple in Cork.  Throughout the speculation about the future of the Hollyhill operation, successive Governments and IDA Ireland have worked with the company to ensure the survival of the Cork plant.  A cloud has hung over Apple Corporation in Cork since 1992.  Like my predecessors, I have taken a keen interest in the operation since I came to office 11 months ago.</P>
    <P>Apple is currently reviewing its worldwide operations with a view to taking further action to secure the future of the company.  In the context of this review and the public speculation over the last few days, this morning I met senior executives from Apple, Cork.  No final decision has been taken, although it is clear that the PCB operation in Cork is one of the areas being examined as part of the worldwide review.  In this regard, I am aware that Apple has outsourced this aspect in other locations.  Clearly, the main concern has to be for the workers at Hollyhill and their families.  The company assured me today that one of its priorities will be to keep its employees fully informed of developments as they arise.</P>
    <P>The company has informed me that no final decision has been taken.  The outcome of the review will become known at about the end of this month.  I will continue to work closely with local management and IDA Ireland to ensure the best result for Cork.  The aim is to maximise the number of jobs in Cork and to ensure that the jobs there are part of a successful worldwide Apple operation.</P>
    <P>I will travel to the United States within the next two weeks to meet the senior vice-president in California who is in charge of the strategy and review for Apple.  The workers and management in Apple, Cork can be assured that I will do all I can to maintain as much as possible of the Apple operation at Hollyhill.  The Government and the industrial development agencies are committed to doing everything possible to secure maximum employment in the Cork region.  This commitment is evident in the fact that more than 4,500 jobs have been announced in the region since this Government came into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  The Minister will be aware that Department officials were heavily involved in the origins of the scheme that evolved into the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland, which provides a cost effective and accessible alternative means of redress for the aggrieved consumer.  At the same time, the office provides an accessible, informal and effectively quasi-judicial complaints procedure while offering the industry substantial savings on disputes resolution.</P>
      <P>Private sector ombudsman schemes have been established and work effectively in other jurisdictions but their success is predicated on noninterference by the industry.  Towards that objective in the Irish context, a structure comprising a council as well as a board was put in place to ensure an arm's length approach.  Essentially, the task of the council is to appoint the ombudsman, to meet quarterly and to ensure that she is properly funded to discharge her functions.</P>
      <P>In an industry where legal costs associated with disputes resolution are enormous, the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman in its first five years has saved millions of pounds and processed 15,000 complaints.  Can the House imagine the usual route &mdash; the courts and what that would cost &mdash; for the resolution of 15,000 cases?  Many of the complainants would not have the financial capacity to access the courts in the first instance. Yet the budget for the office for the year ending 31 December 1997 was no more than £370,000.  I invite the House to contemplate the savings if a similar scheme existed to process Army deafness cases.</P>
      <P>There are two types of ombudsman, a concept which originated in Scandinavia, state ombudsman or private sector ombudsman.  There are famously two problems associated with the discharge of an ombudsman's duties, whether state or private sector.  The first is censorship and the second is funding.  The role of the ombudsman is undermined if he or she is oppressed by either problem.  Hence the preference in many quarters for a statutory based scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only after years of procrastination by the insurance industry in Ireland that the private sector scheme evolved.  After five years it is apparent that the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland has been beset by the two problems to which I referred, censorship and funding.  In this regard, the public letter from Mr. Bill McLoughlin who felt compelled to resign from the council is revealing.  Mr. McLoughlin wrote that &ldquo;it took four years to overcome persistent internal resistance to house the scheme properly&rdquo;.  He continued: &ldquo;Despite the obvious savings to the industry, she has had to battle constantly for funds to be paid on time&rdquo;.  Mr. McLoughlin went on to <Col N="123" /> talk about &ldquo;the continuance of a totally unnecessary overdraft&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>More remarkably, Mr. McLoughlin alleges that Ms Marrinan-Quinn &ldquo;has had to resist unrelenting bullying since the moment she took up her office&rdquo;.  It is also claimed that the council sought to approve and alter the ombudsman's annual report.  I hope the Minister does not think this is amusing, because I certainly do not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than the report being a public service document for consumers, elements on the council sought to use it as a marketing tool for the industry.  The situation is obviously intolerable and the Minister cannot wash his hands of the controversy.  If the industry is successful in forcing the resignation of Ms Marrinan-Quinn, it will spell the end of an independent private sector ombudsman for the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to make clear his wish that Ms Marrinan-Quinn's period of office be extended for a further year, that the performance of the scheme be closely monitored by his Department and that if current practice continues, he will give an undertaking to the House that he will introduce a statutory based scheme for the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot stand idly by and watch the vital independence of the office of ombudsman being eroded.  The nature of our range of insurance products is so opaque and unintelligible to the average consumer that, as the 15,000 complaints processed in five years indicates, there is an enormous and growing demand for the office of ombudsman.  Across the water it is clearly established that other problems are confronting the trusting consumer, such as mis-selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard reports that the current incumbent of the office has been obliged on more than one occasion to borrow to pay the staff wages. This is against a background where the caseload went up by 48 per cent in 1995 but the requisite additional staff were not provided.  The insurance industry must make up its mind.  It cannot have it both ways.  If the industry wants to ward off what <Col N="124" /> it sees as the imposition of a statutory based scheme, it must be prepared to facilitate the independent functioning of a private sector ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It cannot be allowed to believe that in 1998 it will get away with a merely decorative or tame ombudsman who will be prepared to function within what the industry regards as expedient parameters.  Given the importance of the insurance industry in the lives of so many of our citizens, the silence of the Minister is depressing. He has shown himself to be acquiescent to the industry's viewpoint on a number of issues. However, I ask him to acknowledge in this case that in Ms Marrinan-Quinn, the consumer and the industry has an exceptional ombudsman who has asserted her independence in the face of bullying and who has established a splendid reputation for the office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a detailed outline of the position regarding these matters in the course of a Seanad Adjournment debate on 23 April 1998.  On that occasion I pointed out that, as the insurance ombudsman service is a private sector scheme, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the resignation of a member of the council, or on public statements made by a council member regarding the scheme.</P>
      <P>Our primary concern is to ensure, in the interests of the consumer as policyholder, that the ombudsman is enabled to discharge the responsibilities of that office, in accordance with the terms of reference.  When the scheme was being launched by the insurance industry in 1992, the endorsement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was sought.  At his insistence, the terms of reference were expanded to provide a wider ambit of discretion to the ombudsman, in the determination of issues in dispute between policyholders and insurers.</P>
      <P>To ensure the independence of the ombudsman, the operation of the service is divided into three component parts.  The first part is a board comprising executives elected from those insurers taking part in the scheme.  The second is a council made up of nominees from within and outside the insurance industry.  The council recruits and appoints the ombudsman subject to the approval of the board.  The third component is the Office of the ombudsman itself, where policyholder disputes are referred and resolved.  The member companies of the scheme are bound by the ombudsman's decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As documented in its recent five year review, the office of the Insurance ombudsman has proved an outstanding success as a dispute resolution service.  It has settled disputes and complaints by mediation and conciliation, in addition to issuing written adjudications in more intractable cases.  It has provided an invaluable service for the consumer and has led to improved sales practices and <Col N="125" /> claims handling by insurance companies participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I met the insurance ombudsman personally last December and arising from the matters then discussed, I sought a meeting with the council.  At that meeting with the chairman and deputy chairman, I conveyed our concern that the council should be seen to act as an effective buffer between the board, representing the participating insurance companies, and the ombudsman, to ensure that the ombudsman had unfettered autonomy in discharging the responsibilities of this very important office, in accordance with the agreed terms of reference.  The council representatives assured me that this was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>They in turn undertook to reflect on particular matters which I raised with them.  I intend to have further discussions with the council later this year.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Insurance Ombudsman will continue to operate and it will continue to prosper. If the Deputy needs tangible proof of this I would simply point out that advertisements in respect of the forthcoming vacancy created by Ms Marrinan-Quinn's departure from the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland were placed in the national papers.</P>

      <Col N="126" /> In conclusion, I reiterate that I am satisfied that the ombudsman scheme is operating in a highly effective manner to the benefit of the consumer as policyholder.  As I said in my reply to Dáil questions on 18 February 1998, the record of the present insurance ombudsman has set an exceptionally high standard of performance of the ombudsman service that will ensure its continuation and development into the future.  For my part, I will continue to maintain an active watching brief on behalf of the consumer interest in having ready access to an efficient and effective dispute resolution service.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Deputy Rabbitte is taking such a new found interest in this office.  He was Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Enterprise for over two years prior to my appointment.  I regret to say that this request was not considered by him during that period.  I do not understand why he is looking for changes in the dying moments of the great service given by this outstanding ombudsman, when he could have implemented them himself if he had deemed them to be warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>European Social Funding and the consequences for the INTERREG II programme are a matter of concern for a number of organisations. Some of the measures in the INTERREG II programme are directed at increasing training and human resource opportunities in some of the most deprived communities in the country.  The dynamic behind the INTERREG II programme is to bring together two regions in the EU.  In this case Wales and east Ireland have been brought together as a funding agent to ensure that their activity is of benefit to the economic generation of those areas.  It also ensures that people work together and get some tangible benefit from their activity.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a specific case which has been on the Minister's Department's files for some time &mdash; the Virginia House Tallaght Community Arts Centre which has established a media access training course with partners in Wales.</P>
      <P>Money was awarded for the media access training course in September 1997 and since then the centre has been waiting for a substantial tranche of money under the INTERREG II programme. It is incomprehensible that a programme cannot be established because the necessary funding has not been provided by the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that has arisen as a result of lack of funding is that the Welsh partner has completed its second stage of training while the Tallaght course has been unable to get off the ground.  The Tallaght centre has been trying to ascertain from the Department when it will get <Col N="127" /> the final tranche of money for the programmes, but no information has been forthcoming since last September.  Similar problems are experienced by organisations throughout the country.  In exasperation the organisation in my constituency asked me to raise this matter to ensure the Minister takes action.  I realise the final decision rests with the European Commission, but the Minister should do everything in his power to ensure the moneys are granted to these organisations, which are without huge political clout.  In the main, they are non-profit-making organisations, many of whose schemes are community working schemes. This centre demands the final tranche of money from Europe so that it can proceed with its programmes in conjunction with its Welsh partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy initially to the replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 38 of 7 May and 82 of 6 May.  The INTERREG Maritime Initiative is a joint Ireland-United Kingdom programme under the European Union's initiative for the development of cross-border regions throughout the Union.  The lead Departments for this programme are the Department of Finance and the Welsh Office.  Most of the funding involved comes from the European Regional Development Fund.  There is also an element of European Social Funding involved in its subprogramme 2 which deals with human resources development.  Our Department has responsibility for the drawdown of the ESF element on the Irish side while the United Kingdom's Department of Education and Employment has a similar role in respect of the ESF component of the programme on the Welsh side.</P>
      <P>The difficulties referred to by the Deputy relate primarily to the ESF aspects of the initiative. I understand, however, that there are also cash-flow difficulties arising on the European Regional Development Fund element of the initiative.  Without going into the details here I would point out to the Deputy, first, that the various EU Structural Funds each have quite different rules not least in relation to how and when drawdowns can be made and, second, that in some significant ways the European Regional Development Fund rules are more flexible than those used by the ESF.</P>
      <P>There are a large number of similar cross-border INTERREG initiatives across the member states frontiers in the European Union.  The EU procedures for the drawdown of European Social Funds for all of these initiatives require that both sets of national authorities apply separately for funding advances to the European Commission. On arrival in Brussels, however, both applications are processed together so that any problems arising in the processing of either state's application have the unfortunate effect of automatically delaying action on both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of the problem in this case relates to ongoing technical difficulties encountered by <Col N="128" /> the United Kingdom authorities which have given rise to processing problems within the Commission. For the reasons I have already outlined, this has meant that Irish drawdown claims on behalf of our beneficiaries could not be expedited by the Commission.  I emphasise that the problems which have given rise to the delay were not caused by the Irish side and that while every effort has been and is being made by our officials to have the problems solved, it is literally beyond our Department's scope to correct the matters in question involving the UK and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Active efforts to resolve the problems have been pursued by our Department for some time. Our officials and those of the Department of Finance have had several meetings with those from the Welsh Office and the UK Department of Education and Employment.  The most recent of these took place last week.  Arising from these contacts arrangements are now in place to ensure closer collaboration in submissions to Brussels.</P>
    <P>On the aspect of most immediate importance, I understand that following joint consultations between all involved, a revised decision on financing for this initiative has been submitted by the Commission services to Commissioner WolfMathies for approval.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance have been in contact with the European Commission at senior level to bring to attention the critical need for an early resolution. A decision on this matter by the Commissioner will in turn facilitate an immediate application for a drawdown of funds by our Department.  Once funds come from the Commission they will immediately be transferred to the various individual projects.  As several of these steps are outside the control of our Department's hands, I cannot say with certainty when funds will issue, but I expect this should occur within the next month.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Hayes and the project beneficiaries that I too accept the need to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, that our Department has made and will continue to make every effort to resolve the impediments involved, which are both beyond our control and not of our making. While I hope for an early resolution, once again I am not in a position to offer guarantees as to dates or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Pollution of waterways can arise from various sources, including domestic, industrial and agricultural.</P>
      <P>Nutrient management planning, which involves the recycling of farm wastes onto the farm and the correlation of fertiliser usage, especially phosphates and nitrates, with cropping requirements, aims to reduce the risk of pollution from agriculture.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, has a major role to play in the promotion of nutrient management planning.  One of the more important measures of REPS is the requirement to prepare a waste management, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm.  This measure is designed to protect the quality of our waterways by minimising nutrient losses from agriculture. Over 34,500 farmers have joined the scheme from 1994 to date and I envisage that the original target of 43,000 farmers in the scheme will be exceeded by 1999.</P>
      <P>A code of good practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was published jointly in July 1996 by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled water.</P>
      <P>Substantial assistance has been provided by my Department in recent years in grant aid for investment in pollution control facilities under the control of farm pollution scheme and the farm improvement programme.</P>
      <P>In addition to grant aid for investment in farm pollution works, improved capital allowances for investment in controlling pollution on farms were introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, and enhanced in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has overall responsibility for implementation of legislation for the protection of the environment.  In this area, the Waste Management Act, 1996, empowers local authorities to take action where pollution of waterways is being caused by overuse of fertilisers.</P>

      <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland takes particular account of the needs of small scale producers and a number of specific measures have been introduced and continue to <Col N="132" /> operate to address the problems of these producers. The milk quota restructuring scheme gives total priority to small scale producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons.  Under the temporary leasing scheme 75 per cent of the pool is made available to producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>Producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons get priority in the redistribution of unused quotas, flexi-milk, at the end of each milk quota year.  They are allocated 70 per cent of the available quota under this measure.  The ring-fencing of quota in disadvantaged areas and the clawback of quota on land leases and sales were put in place principally to try to safeguard the position of small scale producers.  The Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal adjudicates on cases of hardship and over the years, on its recommendation, quota has been allocated to many applicants, mostly small scale producers.  I will, in the future, continue to make whatever efforts are possible within the constraints of the regulations to help these producers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not wish to downplay the results of the study or the dangers of E.coli 0157.  I have already taken measures to reduce the risk of E.coli contamination.  Last January, I introduced <Col N="133" /> regulations under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which prevent the sale to slaughter plants of cattle which fail to meet minimum standards of cleanliness. Apart from this there is already in place a general requirement on the operators of slaughter plants to observe general hygiene standards which are such as to prevent E.coli contamination. Operators are also legally obliged to carry out microbiological testing of product to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I provided funds this year for a wide ranging E.coli testing programme at all levels throughout the beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were published on 18 March 1998.  A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was convened on 31 March 1998 to enable Ministers to put forward their initial responses to the proposals.  At that meeting, I informed the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests that would be affected by the proposals and told them that the proposals were seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and that, consequently, Ireland rejected them in their present form.</P>
      <P>A preliminary technical examination of the proposals has been carried out in Council working groups and in the Special Committee on Agriculture over the past two months, where Ireland's concerns were set out.  The proposals were again discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 25-26 May, when a progress report was prepared for the European Council in Cardiff on 15-16 June.  That report included, at my request, an acknowledgement that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account and a recognition by the Council of the need to avoid renationalisation of the CAP and distortion of competition while simplifying it and further decentralising its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to this House on 23 April, I will continue to put Ireland's case forcefully to my ministerial colleagues and to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture both in the Council and <Col N="134" /> bilaterally.  It is my objective to obtain a final agreement which not only will not disadvantage Ireland but will provide a favourable framework within which the Irish agriculture and food industries can continue to develop for the benefit of those who work in those industries and for the economy as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, Irish beef or beef products were exported to 48 countries outside the European Union.  It is primarily a matter for the beef industry, with the assistance of Bord Bia, to identify and meet market demand.</P>
      <P>Apart from ensuring uninhibited market access for Irish cattle and beef exports, my main concern is to see beef re-establish its share of the high value markets of the European Union.  Many of these markets had become renationalised in recent years.  This resulted in a major shift in the pattern of Irish beef exports over the last few years as the Irish industry had to switch an increasing share of sales from European markets to international markets.  Continuing liberalisation of world trade makes it all the more important that this recent development be reversed.  At my request, Bord Bia prepared a new beef marketing strategy with the objective of rebuilding EU market share and achieving a better balance between our exports to EU and international markets.  This strategy is under discussion with the industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 31 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the case made by sheep producers that, although ewes are counted in the calculation of eligibility for the <Col N="135" /> extensification premium, they are not eligible for the premium itself.  I have made strong representations to the Commission for the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheepmeat sector. However, the Commission has not accepted such a proposal on the grounds that the rural world premium, which was introduced in the context of the 1992 CAP reform package, is of major benefit to the majority of extensive producers in the Union.  Neither has it agreed to the exclusion of sheep from the calculation of stocking density for the extensification premium.  The Commission argues that to do so would introduce a new inequity between beef producers who also rear sheep and producers who rear cattle only.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to press the Commission on this matter in the context of the discussions on Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the capital markets and long-term financing of developing Irish enterprise study carried out by Peter Bacon and Associates at the end of 1996, an evaluation of the merits of introducing, <i>inter alia</i>, a mutual loan guarantee scheme for SMEs was undertaken.  This evaluation was conducted by officials from Forfás, Forbairt and my own Department during 1997 and included an analysis of mutual loan guarantee schemes in other European countries.  The group found no discernible market appetite for a mutual guarantee scheme nor did it consider that there was sufficient evidence of failure in the SME credit market here as to justify the introduction of such a scheme.  The evaluation did not rule out consideration of such a scheme, should a retrenchment in bank lending emerge in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this month my Department appointed consultants to evaluate the need and scope for introducing new financial mechanisms for small businesses, including start-up businesses.  This evaluation will include mutual guarantee schemes and the consultants have been specifically asked <Col N="139" /> to consider other financial support measures that may exist in other EU countries and which it might be appropriate to introduce here.</P>
    <P>Many improvements have taken place in the availability of capital for business in recent years. These include the small business expansion loan scheme, the access to finance scheme, a number of new venture capital funds through the current Operational Programme for Industrial Development and the launching by the Irish Stock Exchange of the developing companies market. Last week I announced details of the Enterprise 2000 Fund - a new joint venture initiative by Bank of Ireland Business Banking and Forbairt, making a £10 million seed capital fund available to young innovative companies, whose financing needs are not being met by existing venture capital or bank finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the current negotiations to create a multilateral agreement on investment known as the MAI.  The MAI is being negotiated under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.  All 29 member countries of the OECD, including Ireland, are taking part in the negotiations.  It is intended that the MAI will be a free-standing international treaty open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations.</P>
      <P>The state of play in the MAI negotiations and the Government's general approach and position on specific issues were set out in the replies to parliamentary questions on 21 April 1998, 12 May 1998 and 26 May 1998.</P>
      <P>Countries which become party to the MAI would commit themselves to treat foreign investors no less favourably than they treat their own investors.  They would also agree not to discriminate among investors of different MAI parties. It is expected that these principles will apply, in general, to the granting of investment incentives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a document entitled A New Research Fund and the Support of Postgraduate Researchers in Ireland, a paper presented to me during the course of one of my meetings with the Irish Research Scientists Association.  As Minister with responsibility for Science and Technology, I receive many such submissions from the research community and other interested groups, all of which are considered in the context of policy formulation.</P>
      <P>I assume the £2,000 figure mentioned by the Deputy refers to the annual grant paid to PhD students under the graduate support scheme, which is overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board.  This scheme funds 160 new PhD students per annum for three years.  An informal review of this scheme was carried out last year by the National Research Support Fund Board.  I understand the recommendations of the review were discussed by the board and I can confirm that it did not result in any recommendation to me for increased funding.  This points to an appreciation that this level of funding is clearly understood to be a contribution, never intended to meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is but one source of funding available to PhD students.  Postgraduates are also funded under other schemes overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board and by other State funded schemes.  As part of the £5 million research support package, which I announced on 26 May 1998, £0.5 million has been allocated for studentships in science and technology, involving <Col N="142" /> direct support for doctoral and post-doctoral students.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the competition to which the Deputy refers, which relates to the basic research grant schemes, overseen by the National Research Support Fund Board.  I have already informed the House on a number of occasions in the recent past that funding for this programme has been at a level of £2 million for the last three years.</P>
      <P>I have also pointed out in a recent reply that this level of funding for 1998 was sufficient just to meet commitments entered into in previous years on the basis of projects approved previously by the National Research Support Fund Board.  I informed the House on 28 May last that, in an effort to address the issue of funding new basic research projects, £0.5 million would be provided through the Higher Education Authority for projects evaluated and approved by the National Research Support Fund Board.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme was restructured in 1996 to target it better on the long-term unemployed. Two options were introduced within CE: the job option, with 10,000 places open to persons aged 35 or over who have been on the live register for three years, and the reintegration option, with 30,000 places open to persons aged 21 or over who have been on the live register for one year.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget the number of places on the job option was increased by 1,000 to 11,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of community employment is as an active labour market programme.  In other words, its <i>raison d'etre</i> is to give experience, training and skills to persons who are long-term unemployed so that they can find jobs in the open labour market.  The success of community employment is best gauged by the progression <Col N="143" /> rate of participants in to jobs in the open labour market.  Apart from the additional 1,000 places allocated to the job option in this year's budget, there are no plans to vary the proportion of places within the overall 41,000 places.  Allocation of places under both options is an operational matter for FÁS.  The Government is having an independent review of the community employment programme undertaken by Deloitte and Touche and we expect to have the review shortly. It may be that that review will have recommendations on the future scale, duration and targeting of the programme, but any future changes to the programme will only be made on foot of careful examination and consultation.</P>

The following issues were discussed: the success of the urban renewal programme; the strong partnership which exists between the UDC and the Chamber of Commerce through &ldquo;Industry 2000&rdquo;; the development of a 35 acre site for a new business park by IDA Ireland and the subsequent promotion of this park, when completed, to potential investors; the decentralisation of a division of a Government Department or agency; and the establishment of a community enterprise centre.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to work closely with the UDC, the Chamber of Commerce, public representatives and other local interests to secure new investment for the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The G8 met in Birmingham and issued a final communique on 17 May.  The major themes with which the communique dealt were: promoting sustainable growth in the global economy; growth, employability, and inclusion; combating drugs and international crime; non-proliferation and export controls; and year 2000 bug.</P>
      <P>Under the chapter on sustainable growth, the communique looked forward to a successful EMU which contributes to the health of the world economy.  It identified good global prospects and went on to address the financial crisis in Asia where it expressed support for the reforms under way, stressed the importance of sound economic policy, transparency and good governance, welcomed the support by various multilateral and bilateral donors, and expressed concern about the possible emergence of protectionist trends.</P>
      <P>In relation to the World Trade Organisation, the communique expressed support for continued trade and investment liberalisation, resistance to protectionism, widening of the WTO's membership, full participation of emerging and developing economies in the multilateral trade system, assistance for the least developed countries in trade access and investment prospects, and commitment to partnership with the poorer developing countries in support of their efforts to reform and develop, including in the areas of democracy and good governance, development assistance, debt relief, co-operation in fighting disease, and conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Africa.</P>
      <P>The communique also expressed the intention of continuing co-operation on energy matters in the G8 with a view to ensuring reliable, economic, safe and environmentally-sound energy supplies. The communique also expressed determination to address the problem of climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Under the chapter on growth, employment and inclusion, the communique stressed measures to help young long-term unemployed people and other groups, encouragement for entrepreneurs, structural reforms, lifelong learning, active ageing, and progress towards the implementation of internationally recognised core labour standards.</P>
    <P>Under the chapter on combating drugs and international crime, the communique expressed support for international co-operation and singles out a number of areas, such as transnational organised crime, high-tech crime, money-laundering, trafficking of human beings, official corruption, joint law enforcement actions, environmental crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>Under the chapter on non-proliferation and export controls, the communique reaffirmed the commitment of the G8 to ensure the effective implementation of controls.</P>
    <P>Finally, the communique announced agreement to take further urgent action on the year 2000 computer bug.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Government at the G8 summit also agreed statements on political and security issues.  These were on Indonesia, Kosovo, Bosnia, the Middle East peace process, and Indian nuclear tests.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is not, of course, a member of the G8, the views expressed in Birmingham coincide largely with Irish and EU views on these issues and Ireland is contributing to international efforts in these areas.</P>

      <P>I should explain that the board of CIE has a statutory responsibility under the Transport Act, 1958, in relation to the safe operation of its services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently studying the report by consultants, AD Little, who were engaged by Iarnród Éireann to examine track and signalling infrastructure on railway lines with <Col N="151" /> jointed track.  I understand that the consultants concluded that the railway is being operated safely but pointed out a number of areas where action will be required over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The publication of the report, including the details sought by the Deputy, is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I commissioned a strategic review of rail safety by independent consultants. This is currently under way and is considering all aspects of rail safety.  In addition to the infrastructural aspects looked at by AD Little, it is also examining rolling stock, overall safety policy and on-the-ground safety practice.  The review will take into account the AD Little findings.  The report of this strategic review is expected at the end of September and I have already indicated my intention to publish it.</P>
    <P>When I have considered the findings and conclusions of the safety review, and a parallel review of rail investment requirements, I will make appropriate recommendations to Government.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds to upgrade particular lines on the railway network is an operational matter for Iarnód Éireann for which I have no statutory responsibility.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Current market prices for pigs throughout the EU by comparison with this time last year are down 33 per cent.  This is because production has increased in many member states, including Ireland, following a shortage of supplies last year which was brought about by severe outbreaks of classical swine fever in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Belgium.</P>
      <P>This problem is now resolved, and the affected member states are increasing output to pre-disease levels, resulting in turn in increased supplies and lower prices.  The European Commission has recently introduced, following a request from Ireland and other member states, export refunds for pigmeat, which should help the market.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia is the State body responsible for the promotion of pigmeat sales and is under the aegis of my Department.  The marketing of pigmeat is a commercial function for those involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 around 230,000 tonnes of pigmeat was produced in Ireland.  The total exports came to <Col N="157" /> 116,000 tonnes, of which over 50 per cent went to the UK.  The other main EU markets were the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, Spain and Italy.  The main third country markets included Japan, USA, Russia, Poland, South Korea, China and Hong Kong.  Based on the above figures the average sales on the export market are 2,230 tonnes of pigmeat per week, while the domestic market absorbs 2,192 tonnes weekly.</P>

      <P>Decentralisation has been a major policy objective of Governments for many years.  My Department is heavily decentralised and has played a central role in achieving this objective through major decentralisations in Castlebar, Cavan and Portlaoise and by the operation of services through a nationwide network of local offices and laboratories.  A programme of decentralisation to Johnstown Castle will be implemented in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the influx of a big employer to a rural area contributes to the income and economic development of the surrounding areas and helps to maintain the fabric of rural society and its environment.  These very beneficial economic and social influences are in keeping with the policy of rural development operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>These long-term effects must be weighed against the short-term disruption to efficiency and personnel caused by the transfer of experienced personnel from head office to other Departments and by the internal transfer of similar numbers of personnel to areas not decentralising. It is critical to avoid major disruption to operations, potential financial disallowances by the EU due to either delays or inaccurate payments, the undermining of accreditation status and reduced staff motivation.</P>
      <P>To attempt to limit our exposure, my Department has planned the transfer of areas to Johnstown Castle in four phases in order to allow sufficient time for overlap and training on the complex and financially critical schemes being decentralised.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the scheme of assistance for weather related crop losses (1997) is to provide aid to farmers growing arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed in the small number of very exceptional cases where weather related crop losses in 1997 have seriously threatened the viability of the farm and there was no other significant source of income for the farmer other than the crops which were the subject of the weather losses.  For that reason the eligibility conditions for aid under the scheme were precise.  These conditions were outlined in the scheme which was published last November.</P>
      <P>All applications under this scheme were examined in relation to both the general conditions of the scheme and the detailed conditions that apply for the crop category for which the application was made.

      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 implements the EU Money Laundering Directive in Ireland.  Section 32 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a financial institution, including An Post, &ldquo;shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service .&rdquo;. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate the consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 guidance notes were issued in May 1995 by the Money Laundering Steering Committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing the various sectors of the financial services industry and <Col N="164" /> the relevant regulatory authorities.  The guidance notes recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature.  The guidance notes also recommend that permanent addresses be verified through, among other things, reference to recent utility bills, such as those of the ESB.  The guidance notes state, however, that it may be reasonable to depart from recommended verification procedures in certain circumstances, for example, when the young or the elderly may not be able to provide the documentary evidence of identity which is required of other customers.  It is a matter for an institution's management to determine the type of evidence which they are prepared to accept in such cases in order to meet their legal obligations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The guidance notes used by financial institutions are in the process of being reviewed by the Money Laundering Steering Committee and the operation of customer identification procedures will be examined as part of this process.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied that adequate measures are being taken to ensure that the customer identification provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, are implemented in a consistent manner.</P>

      <P>A levy of 1 per cent was imposed on certain insurance premiums in 1982.  This levy was increased to 2 per cent in 1993.  The levy is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premiums, the exceptions being reinsurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.  The yield from this levy in 1997 was £30.5 million.  Similar levies exist in most other EU countries and, in general, at rates much higher than 2 per cent.  The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue.  Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to abolish this levy.</P>

      <P>The employment and training levy was introduced pursuant to the provisions of the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981.  The levy, which was introduced with effect from 6 April 1982, applies at a rate of 1 per cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, e.g. social welfare payments.  The total income of medical card holders and recipients of social welfare survivor's and widow's pensions, lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit-allowance are exempt from the levy.  Furthermore, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum.  This has been increased each year since and now stands at £207 per week, £10,750 per annum, following the last budget.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangement ensures that most pensioners on low and middle incomes are exempt from the levy.  Consequently, I do not intend to fully exempt occupational pensions from the levy but I can confirm that the threshold for the levies will continue to be reviewed.</P>

A person whose spouse dies is entitled to an increased widowed person's tax free allowance, equivalent to the allowance for a married couple, in the year of assessment in which the spouse dies.  In tax law a year of assess begins on 6 April.  If the death of a spouse occurred on 2 April 1998, the relevant year of assessment in which the surviving spouse is entitled to the increased widow's tax free allowance <Col N="166" /> is the 1997-98 tax year, i.e. the year beginning 6 April 1997.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy notes that the most effective way of reducing poverty is the creation of jobs.  The Government's policy programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, recognises the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation.  The tax measures introduced in this year's budget are consistent with these aims.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget implemented the first stage of significant tax reform that was signalled in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  Among the measures introduced were reductions of 2 per cent in both the standard and top rates of income tax, significant increases in personal allowances, a widening of the standard income tax band, an increase in the PRSI-free allowance to £100 per week and an increase in the income threshold for the payment of the employment and training and health levies.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget also introduced a new initiative &mdash; Job Assist &mdash; which is designed to help the long-term unemployed return to work.  This provides a special tax deduction tapered over three years for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job, and a double tax deduction for employers employing a previously long-term unemployed person.  This can last up to 36 months provided the previously long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.</P>
      <P>I am confident the tax measures I introduced, and the measures outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium, are employment-friendly and will succeed in maintaining the strong employment growth of recent years.</P>

      <P>There is close co-operation between all Government agencies in the battle against drug smuggling.  On 12 January 1996, a Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, was signed between the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners.  The MOU is a formal police-customs <Col N="167" /> agreement setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of both services.  It provides a framework to facilitate and foster the development of greater police-customs co-operation in the fight against drugs and introduces clear and agreed lines of demarcation between the two agencies.</P>
      <P>The necessary operational and liaison structures, which are subject to review, have been put in place.  These include a joint task force comprising the Customs, Garda and Naval Services, if required for maritime operations.  There is nationwide liaison at local level between nominated Customs and Garda officers in addition to the exchange of personnel between the Customs National Drugs Team and the Garda National Drugs Unit, at head office level.  This nationwide liaison was formally put in place in February 1997.</P>
      <P>The Government programme relating to drugs law enforcement is overseen by an <i>ad hoc</i> group comprising a deputy commissioner of the Garda Síochána, an assistant secretary, Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the flag officer, Naval Service.  All these arrangements are working well.</P>
      <P>A major contribution towards effective co-operation has been the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996.  The bureau operates through its &ldquo;bureau officers&rdquo; who have been drawn from the Garda Síochána, officers of the Revenue Commissioners (Customs and Excise and Taxes), and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Close and ongoing liaison is maintained between the bureau officers and the fraud and drugs-intelligence services in these agencies and this has contributed in a significant degree to the success of the CAB in combating drug trafficking, including the seizure of assets.  Additionally, the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, provides the statutory basis on which Revenue can provide information to enhance the workings of the CAB.  Revenue has as a consequence been able to provide valuable information and support on a timely basis to the CAB in its work in depriving criminals of their assets.</P>
      <P>Under the European Council Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime, adopted by the Council on 28 April 1997, a multidisciplinary group on organised crime was established at national level in 1997.  It comprises representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners (Customs and Excise).  As a result further steps were taken to develop and facilitate a co-ordinated approach against organised crime, including drug trafficking.  This group reports to the European Council Multidisciplinary Working Party which facilitates a co-ordinated approach in the fight against organised crime at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> The pooling of intelligence between the agencies in addition to respective expertise enhances the focus on counteracting drug trafficking and the dismantling of drug organisations.  To date, operations involving the enforcement agencies have proved successful in the detection of drugs and the successful prosecution of those involved.</P>

      <P>Preparations to ensure there are no major difficulties in relation to Ireland's entry to EMU on 1 January 1999 are well under way.  For example, on 5 May last I established the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, to oversee the practical implementation of the changeover to the single currency, the euro, and to provide public and consumer information in that regard.</P>
      <P>As regards the fractional reserve system, it will be a matter for the European Central Bank, ECB, to decide what, if any, fractional reserve system will operate in the euro area.  Under the Central Bank Act, 1971, reserve requirements for Irish banks are set by the Central Bank: I understand from the bank that the reserve requirements operating in Ireland are broadly comparable with those of other European countries and that there is no reason to expect ECB requirements to significantly affect the lending capacity of Irish banks.  In EMU, bank customers will have better access to both deposit and borrowing facilities, as bank liquidity will be more readily available across national borders.  It is not expected that EMU will have a major impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the Irish monetary sector.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the treatment of cohabiting couples by my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is anomalous.  There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis of the treatment of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.  The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment.  Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report later this year. <Col N="171" /></P>

      <P>Dental treatment services for children are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme.  The programme has been specifically designed to ensure children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc., provided as necessary.  An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children in national schools.</P>

      <P>Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, i.e. medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he-she satisfies the health boards that it is his-her intention to remain <Col N="173" /> here for a minimum period of one year.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Applicants for medical cards are subject to a means test.  As nationality is not a determining factor in eligibility for health services health boards do not normally hold the type of information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations, persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state, who are not in receipt of an Irish Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs pension, as either a recipient or dependant, and who are not employed or self-employed here are entitled to a medical card irrespective of means.  The relevant Regulation 1408/71 specifies that such persons are entitled to the same level of benefits, i.e. medical card, as those available in the state in which they are staying on behalf of the state responsible for payment of the pension. Otherwise, they are entitled to health services on the same basis as persons normally resident here i.e. subject to a means test.  The costs involved in providing care to persons who qualify for health services under EU regulations are the responsibility of the state which pays the social security pension.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the parents who effected &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; adoptions in Paraguay on Wednesday, 3 June to discuss the problems encountered by the families due to the non-recognition of such adoptions in Ireland and possible mechanisms to have the adoptions recognised.  It is my understanding that the parents are considering taking steps to have their adoptions converted into full adoptions in Paraguay under the new Paraguayan adoption law.  If this approach proves unsuccessful, I will return to the matter in the Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on the protection of children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption and explore whether means can be found to recognise the adoptions in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of meeting the parents' representatives raised the issue of the insertion of a provision in the next Finance Bill to provide that children adopted under &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Paraguayan adoptions are accorded the same status with regard to capital acquisitions tax as children adopted under the Adoption Acts, or adopted under a foreign adoption which qualifies for entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.  I agreed to <Col N="175" /> raise the matter with the Department of Finance and I have done this.</P>
    <P>The travel document referred to by the Deputy is available from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is issued in circumstances where the families are not able to obtain or renew Paraguayan passports for their children. As the children are Paraguayan citizens, the visa requirements of other countries for such persons must be adhered to by the families concerned whether they travel on a Paraguayan passport or using the document issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The reference to the naturalisation of children adopted by means of simple adoptions is from a note from the then Department of Justice to my Department prepared in the context of the interdepartmental committee on Paraguayan adoptions. I do not intend to publish the note.</P>

      <P>The funding of voluntary agencies such as the Centre for Independent Living, CIL, is a matter for the relevant health boards.  The national head-quarters of CIL in Dublin receives an annual grant of £50,000 from the Eastern Health Board towards its core funding.  In December 1997, I gave once-off revenue grants of £140,000 to CIL and £230,000 to the Independent Living Community Service, a joint Rehab-CIL organisation formed to support CIL centres throughout the country in their activities.</P>
      <P>No particular amount was allocated for the transport taxi service as it is considered that responsibility for this type of accessible public transport does not lie with the health boards.</P>

      <P>Under current mental treatment legislation, a child is regarded as any person up to the age of 16.  Any person over 16 years of age is considered to be an adult for the purpose of the legislation and may be referred to the adult psychiatric services <Col N="180" /> if necessary.  Consequently, no specific acute psychiatric service is provided by the Southern Health Board to deal exclusively with 16 to 18 year olds.  Those assessed as being in need of psychiatric care and treatment are generally referred and treated by a consultant psychiatrist attached to the adult services.  However, some adolescents in the Southern Health Board area who have been assessed prior to age 16 may continue to be offered a service up to age 18.</P>
      <P>A new mental health Bill is currently being prepared which I hope to introduce to both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  Under the new legislation, a person will be considered a child up to the age of 18 in line with child care legislation.</P>
      <P>The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service has been identified as a priority in my Department's health strategy and a consultant-led service is now available in each health board.  An adviser in child and adolescent psychiatry has also been appointed.  He is currently reviewing the nature and extent of existing services and will advise on the formulation of policy on the future development of the services on a national scale.  A report prepared by the adviser is expected to be completed shortly for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board's policy on the treatment of alcohol and substance misuse is an outpatient drug-free approach, which services are based on the Minnesota model and therapeutic community model.  These services support the wide range of services provided by mental health services.</P>
      <P>The counselling service for substance misuse among 16 to 18 year olds is currently provided at Arbour House adolescent unit in Cork.  This is an outpatient service providing assessment and treatment in a day programme, or referral to other appropriate services where necessary.  New addiction services are currently being developed in west Cork and Kerry with additional counsellors being appointed at Arbour House and Cork city north.  These locations will provide a greater accessibility to assessment and treatment.  The recruitment process is under way for these new posts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The management, organisation and provision of health services is the statutory responsibility of the health board in association with the voluntary hospitals and voluntary agencies in the first instance.  This necessarily involves the identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department.  Each agency, on receipt of their annual level of financial determination and as part of their preparation of an annual service plan, makes decisions with regard to the staffing levels and the skills mix it requires to provide an agreed level of service within overall financial allocation.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to make valid comparisons between regions and agencies based on staffing ratios.  Even given similar populations, there are significant differences in case complexity, patient profile, facilities and equipment, the range and complexity of services provided, socio-demographic factors and health and social requirements. Consequently, my Department does not collect information on ratios as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board to decide its priority requirements in relation to staffing, including consultant posts, having regard to its financial determination and the service needs of its catchment population.</P>
      <P>However, I have made inquiries of the board and Comhairle na nOspidéal who are statutorily responsible for the approval of consultant appointments in the country.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has informed me that following the review of hospital services by Kevin Kenny and the review of consultant manpower by Comhairle na nOspidéal, a pan-hospital approach was adopted in the region with a view to co-ordinating and agreeing the consultant requirements for the region.  I am informed by the Southern Health Board that since the publication of the Kenny report 12 new consultant posts and 12 replacements consultant posts have been filled permanently in the region.  In addition, 13 new and replacement consultant posts are in the process of being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that comparisons other <Col N="184" /> than measuring the number of additional consultant posts can indicate the level of development of services within the Southern Health Board region.  For example funding to the Southern Health Board has increased by 135 per cent and overall staffing in the board has increased by 17 per cent in the last decade which is, I assume, the same period referred to by the Deputy in his question.</P>

It is the function of local hospital management to agree work rotas with NCHDs, taking into account the nature of the service to be provided.  Accordingly, rotas more onerous than one night every eight to ten days are worked by NCHDs in Dublin and in other parts of the country, having regard to such factors as the specialty involved, the need to provide emergency cover and the liability to provide an on-call service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 147, 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The determination of priorities for capital expenditure is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance and my Department is in regular contact with the board about capital investment in the board'a acute hospitals.  I am committed to making provision for priority capital needs and I have made in excess of £2 million available to the board towards the cost of replacing medical equipment, maintenance and fire precaution works in the 1998 determination of expenditure.  This is the first time that such a provision has been made and it is also intended that such a provision will be a feature of future determinations. The question of further capital funding for essential equipment over and above the significant sum already made available is being considered as a matter of urgency and I expect to communicate shortly with the board about the matter.</P>

      <P>The appointment of replacement consultants is a matter for each health agency, subject to the approval of my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board, who has advised me that he has commenced the procedures in the normal manner to ensure that replacement consultants are recruited in both cases.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the process of appointing a consultant can take some time because of the necessity to ensure the recruitment of the most suitably qualified candidate.  In order to ensure the seamless continuation of services it is the normal practice for agencies to utilise the services of a locum consultant.</P>

      <P>The issue of rates of pay for home-helps in the Southern Health Board area is a matter, in the first instance, for the board.  The board has advised me that it will increase the rate of pay to £2.00 per hour from 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the board that the issue of payment to home-helps was raised at a meeting of the board on 2 June last by a group representing home helps.  I understand the board members agreed to suspend standing orders to hear a deputation from the group.  Subsequently, the representatives of home-helps disrupted the business of the meeting which was then adjourned by the chairman.  The board reports that it regrets this action by the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department has arranged to have an examination of the home-help services carried out by an independent body under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  I expect work on this review to be completed shortly.  When I have received the report I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home-help service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 156, 157, 161, 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The determination of service priorities in the areas referred to by the Deputy is a matter, in the first instance, for the Southern Health Board which has statutory responsibility for the provision of health services in Counties Cork and Kerry.  Where these priorities give rise to a need for additional resources they fall to be discussed and agreed with my Department in the context of the annual Estimates and service planning process. This year I have provided in excess of £3 million in respect of additional staffing and developments for acute hospital services in the Southern Health Board area.  Additional funding has been provided to the Southern Health Board for a range of developments at Cork University Hospital, including increased staffing in the areas of accident and emergency, intensive care and cardiology.  Funding has also been provided for new consultant posts in oncology, cardiology and accident and emergency, all of which will have service commitments to Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The range of service improvements being put in place is clear evidence of this Government's commitment to the development of hospital services in Cork and I am committed to working with the Southern Health Board in the future to address other needs as these are identified and prioritised.  With regard to the replacement posts referred to by the Deputy, I wish to advise that where the relevant documentation has been submitted by the Southern Health Board, these are being processed by my Department in accordance with normal practice.</P>

      <P>I have received a submission from the organisation in question, which identifies the shortfall it has in both capital and revenue expenditure.  Following <Col N="190" /> receipt of the submission I wrote to the organisation in March inviting it to meet one of the officials from the community health division in my Department, which is responsible for drugs policy and liaison with health boards.  As far as I am aware it has not yet contacted this official.</P>
      <P>The provision of drug treatment services is a matter for health boards in the first instance and in the Limerick area this is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board pays a grant to the centre to cover the cost of patients whom it refers to it for treatment.  The clients attending the centre from the Dublin area are attending it on a private basis and have not been referred by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has informed me that it has provided a grant of £12,000 in 1998 towards the operation of the organisation.  In 1997 my Department made a once off capital grant of £80,000 to the centre to help with capital costs.</P>
      <P>Funding for drugs services has been totally allocated to health boards for 1998.  My Department is therefore examining this submission in the context of what assistance could be given to the centre in 1999, but this is ultimately a question of health boards prioritising funding for this purpose from the allocations made to them for their drug services.</P>

      <P>The work of the high level group on road safety on the preparation of a national road safety strategy will shortly be completed and I intend to present the strategy to the Government and publish it immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>Pending finalisation of the strategy, action by the road safety agencies is being stepped up.  A substantially increased grant has been provided by my Department to the National Safety Council in 1998 for the purpose of improving road safety and promoting road accident prevention.  Garda enforcement of road traffic law continues to be given a high priority under the direction of the National Traffic Policy Bureau and through the implementation of Operation Lifesaver.  The National Roads Authority has increased its provision in 1998 for its low cost safety measures programme and for other measures directly related to road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that road fatalities countrywide to end May 1998 showed a decrease of some 10 per cent on the corresponding period in 1997. <Col N="191" /></P>

      <P>It is intended to bring car testing into operation as early as practicable next year.  Regulations to be made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 will provide the statutory basis for the scheme.  Testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres under the control of a contractor to be appointed on a national basis following an EU-wide competitive tendering process.  The tendering process is already under way and my Department will shortly issue detailed invitation to tender documentation to qualified applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> The invitation to tender documentation will incorporate a draft vehicle tester's manual which will set out the methods of testing and reasons for failure for all test items including tyres.  My Department has undertaken consultation with a wide range of interested parties, including the Irish Tyre Industry Association, about the detailed parameters for the test.  In specifying the test I will take account of the outcome of these consultations, subject to the requirements of the relevant EU directive.</P>
    <P>Information from the National Roads Authority indicates that 237, or some 1.8 per cent of 13,568 vehicles involved in injury accidents reported to the Garda in 1997 had defective tyres. This date does not necesarily relate to the cause of the accidents.</P>

I intend to bring forward further comprehensive legislation, which will modernise local government law generally, for publication to mark the centenary of local government.  Preparation of this legislation has commenced and it will, <i>inter alia,</i> contain a modern statutory framework for local authority structures. Any proposals for change in status of town authorities must be considered in the context of this legislation.</P>

      <Quest>if he will recommend in the next budget that increases to widows, widowers and old age pensioners be allocated on the basis of a flat rate rather than a percentage in view of the fact that it is evident that using percentages gives an inequitable increase to someone on small allowances as opposed to someone on a higher benefit or wage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The question of the level of increases in social welfare payments to be provided in the next budget will be decided having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other commitments arising from An Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>A key priority of the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium is that the old age contributory pension will be increased to £100 per week over a five year period.  As a sign of its determination in this regard, the Government has gone beyond what is strictly required by that commitment in the first year.  A special catch-up increase of £5 per week has been provided in the maximum personal rates of all payments for pensioners aged 66 and over, with pro-rata increases for older people on reduced rate contributory pensions.  Payments for all others have been increased by £3 per week, with pro-rata increases for those on reduced rate contributory payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reduced rate contributory payments are made in cases where a claimant has fewer than the required standard of social insurance contributions. The level of benefit payable in such cases is generally set as a percentage of the maximum payment.  For example, in the case of the old age contributory pension, a yearly average of 48 contributions is required in order to qualify for the maximum rate of pension.  However, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 14 contributions can still qualify for payment, but at a reduced rate.  The rate of pension in this case is set at 50 per cent of the maximum pension. Accordingly, the level of increases provided to recipients of reduced rate contributory payments is determined by the percentage relationship <Col N="197" /> between that reduced rate and the appropriate maximum rate of payment.</P>
    <P>The increases which have been provided for in this year's budget have benefited some 890,000 social welfare recipients.  Approximately 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over have had their payments increased by £5 per week, with some 54,000 people on reduced rate contributory pensions receiving proportionate increases.  Approximately 560,000 people under 66 years have had their payments increased by £3 per week, with some 6,000 people on reduced rate contributory payments receiving proportionate increases.</P>

      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to: progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and, increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, has been set up to review the carer's allowance.  The group held its first meeting in January this year. This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It is also examining the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.</P>
      <P>As part of the review process, a series of very useful meetings have been held with a wide number of interest groups and other interested parties. The review is expected to be completed later this year and it will be published.</P>

      <P>Long-term unemployed <Col N="199" /> people avail of the back to work allowance scheme to take up employment or self-employment. The allowance is paid over three years at the rate of 75 per cent in year one, 50 per cent in year two and 25 per cent in year three, of the person's unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>Because of the success of the back to work allowance scheme, the number of places has been increased progressively from 3,000 when the scheme was introduced in 1993 to 27,000 places this year.  At present there are 21,200 participants on the scheme.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to the back to work allowance, long-term unemployed people who take up self-employment may avail of the area allowance, enterprise, scheme which provides an allowance at the rate of 100 per cent of the persons unemployment payment for the first year and which can be followed by the back to work allowance over the succeeding three years.  This scheme operated up to this year only in the designated partnership areas throughout the country but has now been extended nation wide.  The scheme is obviously more attractive to persons commencing self-employment than the back-to-work allowance.</P>
      <P>The numbers on area allowance, enterprise, have increased by over 2,500 to 6,700 since 1 January last.  This has been accompanied by a reduction in the number of self-employed participants on the back to work scheme as those taking up self-employment now generally avail of the area allowance.  The total number of long-term unemployed persons availing of both schemes is currently almost 28,000.</P>
      <P>The average number of applications now being received for back to work allowance is approximately 400 weekly and this reflects the ongoing positive impact which the scheme is having.</P>

      <P>The building in question was built in the last century as a private court for indoor tennis but has not been used for such activities since it was handed over to the State in 1939.  Over the years to the present day it has been used by University College Dublin for different purposes and has been in use as an architectural-engineering laboratory since the 1970s.  This current use of the interior is akin to that of a small industrial factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> A proposal is currently before Dublin Corporation from the Office of Public Works, on behalf of the National Concert Hall, for planning permission to convert the interior of the building from its current use to that of a small auditorium for public performances.  There is no question of demolishing the building and, if planning permission is forthcoming, it is the intention that any of its original features now remaining will be retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available.  Committal statistics are not maintained on a monthly basis and the calculation of the average time spent in prison by persons committed for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court and the average amount involved would require the examination of a large number of files and the resources necessary for this could not be justified. In 1994, however, the latest year for which relevant information is available, the total number of persons committed to prison in default of fines, for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court was 2,443, out of a total of 10,433.  Figures are not yet available for later years.</P>
      <P>The number of such persons in custody at any one time, who were committed for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court is in the order of 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent of the total prison population, that is, less than 40 people.  This is due to the fact that many debtors and fine defaulters make payment either on committal or shortly afterwards, so that the amount of time spent in prison is often quite short.  It is not possible to give a figure for the cost of imprisoning such persons, many of whom might only spend a few hours in custody.  However, in 1996 the annual cost of maintaining a prisoner in custody was £46,150.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering various proposals for alternatives to custody in relation to the non-payment of fines including a system of attachment of earnings, which I would hope to include in an Attachment of Earnings Bill.  Under such an arrangement the court could order that outstanding fines be deducted from a person's earnings and this could represent a form of payment by instalment.</P>

      <P>Treatment for drug addicted offenders is available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation will be supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling.  It is unfortunately the case that despite the availability of the treatment <Col N="210" /> options many offenders continue to fail to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.</P>
      <P>The majority of offenders with drugs problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.  During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison received the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison.</P>
      <P>The drug treatment unit has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's health care unit since July 1996.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  The programme is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  Over 120 inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit since it opened.</P>
      <P>There are a number of options open where inmates have completed the detoxification programme in the drug treatment unit.  They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population; if they are considered suitable they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they may transfer to the drug free unit.</P>
      <P>The drug free unit is in operation at the training unit, which is adjacent to but separate from the main Mountjoy Prison and has accommodation for 96 prisoners.  This facility accommodates prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse in a totally drug-free and secure environment within the prison system.  It also provides a sympathetic, yet closely monitored setting in which those prisoners who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug-free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs.  The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.  In order to address a perceived shortfall in the counselling services available to recovering addicts the Eastern Health Board has recently undertaken to seek to appoint a suitable person from their existing complement of addiction counsellors to be based in the training unit. It is hoped that this appointment will be made during the summer.</P>
      <P>Prisoners in both the Mountjoy treatment facility and the drug free unit are closely monitored by regular and random urine testing.  This testing is done on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prison system, is co-ordinated by the Director of Prison Medical Services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards to ensure a level <Col N="211" /> of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community. Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the guidelines for the operation of the young people's facilities and services fund in the drugs task force areas, including Tallaght, were announced recently.  Twenty million pounds has been earmarked from the fund for the task force areas over three years to support a variety of capital projects, including sport and recreational facilities, and non-capital projects.</P>
      <P>The guidelines set out in general terms are: the objectives of the fund in the task force areas; the process by which integrated plans for each area will be developed and assessed; and the broad criteria that will be applied in assessing the plans.</P>
      <P>As envisaged in the guidelines, a development group in the Tallaght task force area is being established, comprising representation from the local drugs task force, Dublin County Council and the County Dublin VEC, to draw up an integrated facilities and services plan for the Tallaght area.  This plan, together with the plans from the other task force areas, will be submitted by the end of September, via the relevant local drugs task force, to the assessment committee which is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The assessment committee will assess all plans on the basis of the criteria established and will make recommendations, via the national drugs policy group, to the Cabinet Committee on Social</P>
      <P>Inclusion and Drugs regarding the allocation of funding to support the implementation of the plans.</P>
      <P>The assessment committee is currently in the process of finalising the detailed criteria for the operation of the fund which are expected to be agreed within a matter of days.  These criteria, which will be widely available, will be issued to the development groups charged with the development of plans in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of specific projects in the plans will be a matter for the development groups on the basis of the objectives for the young people's <Col N="217" /> facilities and services fund and the criteria agreed. As such, it would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt this process by identifying a specific project as a priority for funding in any of the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>The issues dealt with by the independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming arose in the context of participation by, and coaching of, children in the sport of swimming specifically.  The question of the funding of the Irish Schools Swimming Association, which is affiliated to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, will be considered as soon as I have had the opportunity to discuss the contents of the report of the independent inquiry with the IASA and they have presented to me their proposals for confronting any issues arising for them.  As the Deputy may be aware, Dr. Murphy, chairman of the inquiry, has completed his report and I am now considering the advice of the Attorney-General with a view to early submission to Government on appropriate next steps.</P>

      <P>The Pilot Initiative on Tourism and the Environment, which Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and I first announced towards the end of last year, arose from the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.  European Regional Development Fund grant assistance of 3 MECU &mdash; approximately IR£2.4 million is being made available up to the end of 1999, with a total expected investment of 4.2 MECU &mdash; approximately IR£5.25 million to support projects of a pilot demonstration nature, which will contribute to knowledge and understanding of best practice in terms of sustainable tourism and the environment. The overall emphasis is on tourism-led projects which will achieve immediate results. Proposed projects should seek to enhance the visitor experience while at the same time protecting and benefiting the local environment.</P>
      <P>Applications were invited by advertisements in the national press on 2 and 3 April 1998.  The closing date for submission of applications to Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development, which is administering the scheme on my behalf, is 12 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The selection process will be carried out by a committee comprising: Joe Timbs, Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Chairman); Brendan Leahy, Irish Tourist Industry Confederation; Professor Frank Convery, An Taisce; John Power, Irish Hotels Federation; Larry Stapleton, Environmental Protection Agency; Noel Kavanagh, Bord Fáilte Éireann; Brendan Lynch, Shannon Development; Peadar O'Reilly, Department of the Environment and Local Government; Dave Fadden, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; Maurice O'Connor, Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Gary Masterson, Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Secretary).</P>

    <P>+ In the 1998-9 academic year where two or more children (or the candidate's parent) are pursuing a course of study listed below, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 where there are three such children and so on by increments of £2,060.</P>
    <P>(i) attending full-time third level education.</P>
    <P>(ii) attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student garda training.</P>
    <P>(iii) participating in a CERT course of at least one years duration.</P>
    <P>(iv) attending a full time Teagasc course in an agricultural college.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a grant operates on a graduated basis at present.  In order to qualify for a grant a candidate's reckonable income must be below the income limit, which varies for the level of grant and in relation to the number of dependent children in the family.  Where there are two or more children attending full-time third level education, the relevant income limits are increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 for three children and so on, by increments of £2,060. The income limits vary with the number of dependants.  Different limits apply where there are fewer than four dependent children, between four and seven and eight or more dependants.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the new arrangements in 1992, the income limits were set by the actual number of dependent children, in excess of two and up to ten dependent chidren.  The income limits varied depending on whether a maintenance grant was payable and if so, whether it was payable at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate and depending on the rate of lecture fee grant payable. These arrangements were cumbersome and difficult for the local authorites to administer, while being extremely difficult for an individual candidate to understand.  The new arrangements simplified the income limits, easing the administrative burden on the local authorities and making the system more comprehensible for candidates generally.</P>
    <P>Further refinement to the present graduated system to provide tapering relief for candidates whose income exceeds the relevant limits would have implications for the administration of the schemes and would also involve the commitment of substantial additional resources.  In the light of overall resource constraints I am obliged to have regard to the relative priority of all proposals for improvements and the many competing demands across the education system.  I will, however, keep this question under review in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The funding allocation for the provision of youth services in 1997 and 1998 for the YMCA is £72,100.  Unfortunately, due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible in the current year to provide for increases in the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives.  However, additional funding is being sought for 1998, and in the event of such funding becoming available the level of funding support to youth organisations generally will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The YMCA also receives assistance from the European Social Fund via my Department for the delivery of their Support, Training and Enterprise Programme &mdash; STEP.  A total of £269,344 has been allocated for this programme in the current financial year.  This represents a decrease in punt terms of 7.57 per cent on the 1997 allocation, which is directly attributable to a fluctuation in the ECU &mdash; punt exchange rate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for the appointment of a resource teacher.  My capacity to allocate additional resource teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputies that the needs of this school will be considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the operational crisis that is now confronting many voluntary organisations in the youth sector; if his attention has further been drawn to the relative reduction in the allocation of lottery funds to youth related projects; and if, having regard to the very positive work which youth organisations, including The Irish Girl Guides, do in the consolidation of civic society, he will review the allocation of funds to youth organisations in general and The Irish Girl Guides in particular in 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I acknowledge the great value of the work carried out by the voluntary youth organisations, including the work of the Irish Girl Guides, in their communities.  My Department supports the work of these organisations through the provision of grant aid.  The overall level of resources made available for the provision of youth work services in 1998 is £13,567,000 representing an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision for 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible in the current year to provide for increases in the level of grant aid <Col N="224" /> made available to individual organisations and to youth projects.  However, additional funding is being sought for 1998, and in the event of such funding becoming available the level of funding support to youth organisations, including the Irish Girl Guides, will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The higher diploma in education is offered by the education departments of Trinity College Dublin and the four universities of the National University of Ireland at Cork, Dublin, Galway and Maynooth.  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of applicants and places available in Trinity College, Dublin and Maynooth in the past five years is as follows.  It is important to have regard to the fact that the applications figures would include candidates who have applied to a number of institutions.</P>
      <P>Applicants for a place on a higher diploma in education course are assessed according to academic achievement, the subjects taken in their degree programme, teaching experience, other relevant experience, e.g. social-voluntary work and in the cases of Trinity College and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth performance at an interview.  In the case of the National University of Ireland, Dublin, 50 per cent of places are offered at random to qualified applicants.  The universities are autonomous institutions which set their own admission requirements regulations and it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in such matters in the case of an individual student.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Number of applicants for the higher diploma in education and the number of places provided by Trinity College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth for the last five year.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.  Since the introduction of the breaking the cycle pilot project, schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the scheme have been allocated extra staffing resources to enable them to operate within a maximum class size of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  In line with the agreement referred to above, these staffing allocations are also determined by reference to the schools enrolments at 30 September of the previous school year.  However, there is an arrangement in place whereby schools may contact my Department if their projected enrolments are to increase for the forthcoming school year. In such situations, my Department will re-examine the schools' staffing needs based on the projected enrolments.</P>

      <P>My Department has made £193,000 available, in 1998, for the provision of youth services, to the youth organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question.  Unfortunately, due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible in the current year to provide for increases in the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives.  However, additional funding for 1998 is being sought and in the event of such funding becoming available the level of funding support to youth organisations generally will be reviewed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Scoil Chiaráin, Donnycarney, Dublin 5 and Our Lady of Consolation national school, Donnycarney, Dublin 5, are not paid the full capitation fee normally payable to national schools; the method whereby the diocesan contribution to catholic national schools is decided; and the level of this contribution.</Quest>

      <P>I can confirm that both Scoil Chiaráin and Our Lady of Consolation national school are paid the normal capitation grant of £50 per pupil which includes an 11 per cent increase in 1997. In addition, both schools are also included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and are therefore entitled to a supplementary capitation grant of £30 per pupil.</P>
      <P>Each school in the disadvantaged area scheme is advised by my Department to utilise this supplementary grant as follows:- £9 per pupil to be used towards the purchase of materials-equip-ment, £16 per pupil to be used towards the running costs of the school, £5 per pupil towards the promotion of Home-School-Community liaison activities.</P>
      <P>The supplementary capitation grant is issued to each school in the disadvantaged areas scheme on an annual basis at the beginning of each school year.</P>
      <P>School authorities are required by my Department to supplement these grants with a local contribution, which traditionally stood at 25 per cent of the standard grant.  However, this local contribution has remained unchanged since 1995 at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream national schools, and £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged, and has not been increased in line with the standard grant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos 247, 263 and 264 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance legislation rests with school attendance committes in certain parts of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford.  In all other areas, responsibility rests with the relevant Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by the Duputy in <Col N="229" /> relation to the level of coverage of the service operated by the school attendance committees and the activity levels involved, is not readily available to my Department.  However, the information in question has been sought from the school attendance committees and will be forwarded to the Deputy when received.</P>
    <P>I understand that information on levels of absenteeism in individual school attendance areas has not been formally notified to my Department by school attendance officers for some years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that existing arrangements in relation to school attendance services are inadequate to today's need.  My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with this issue.  My objective is to bring legislation to Government in the autumn. A key objective of this legislation will be to put appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that children's attendance is properly monitored and that corrective action is taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>My Department supports a range of projects outside the existing mainstream programmes targeted on disadvantaged areas.  Under the breaking the cycle pilot programme a total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools in disadvantaged areas are targeted for special packages of staffing and funding supports to enable them to combat educational disadvantage in their areas.  Total expenditure under this initiative in the current school year amounts to £710,000.  The Early Start pre-school pilot programme is targeted at areas of particular disadvantage and under which a total of 40 pre-school projects have been established. The projects in question are capable of catering for up to 1,680 pre-school children.  Total expenditure under this initiative in the current year amounts to approximately £1 million.  Under the teaching counsellor scheme a total of 27 teaching counsellors have been allocated to 32 selected schools in disadvantaged areas of the north inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin. The cost of this initiative in the current year is £675,000.  Homework and other after-school projects are targeted at supporting children in disadvantaged areas.  A total of £145,000 was allocated to this area in 1997.</P>
      <P>Projects involving theatrical workshops focus specifically on themes relevant to children from disadvantaged backgrounds and foster the involvement of the children in the productions in question.  A total of £60,000 was allocated to this area in 1997.</P>
      <P>I recently launched an important new initiative targeted at children from disadvantaged areas in the 8 to 15 age group who have dropped out of the education system or are in danger of doing so.  The objective of this initiative is to identify and test strategies which will achieve the retention of pupils in the school system until certification.  A total of £2.96 million is being made available for this initiative over the next two years.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a scheme whereby grants are paid to principal teachers of national schools to assist with the purchase of textbooks for children who come from needy homes.  The allocation for this scheme in 1998 is £2,534,000.  Allocations to individual schools under this scheme are dependent on the number of needy pupils within each school.</P>

      <P>In order to meet the current urgent need for a schools' psychological service in the primary sector, my Department has recruited 15 psychologists who are also qualified primary teachers to take up employment as educational psychologists.</P>
      <P>This is a special development project which is being organised by my Department's Psychological Service and will run over three years.</P>
      <P>All those who have been appointed possess:</P>
      <P>1.  recognition as a primary school teacher with at least three years' satisfactory experience in teaching in the primary sector</P>
      <P>2.  a recognised first or second class honours degree in which psychology was taken as a major subject in the final degree examination or a post-graduate qualification in psychology with first or second class honours</P>
      <P>3.  ability to communicate effectively in Irish or English and a good knowledge of the other language.</P>
      <P>Two of the successful candidates have been assigned to my Department's Cork office, where they are working as part of a team of psychologists. Their recruitment has enabled the Psychological Service to be expanded to include certain schools in East Cork which did not previously have access to the service.  These schools are listed below.</P>
      <P>The psychologists work normal Civil Service hours.  As each psychologist serves a number of schools, there will be limits in terms of the amount of time which can be devoted to each school.  It will be necessary, therefore, to identify the main needs in each school, in consultation with the Principal teacher and staff, and to prioritise them.  Arising from this consultation, an agreed plan of work will be developed.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 317 of 17 February 1998 and 432 of 24 March 1998 in relation to the amalgamation of Lisaneena and Ballinacarrow national schools, the reason a person (details supplied) in County Sligo was transported free of charge by bus to Ballincarrow national school for the duration of her years there, yet persons who travel the same bus route from the same pick up point have to pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is understood that the original family home of the person to whom the Deputy refers is in the Lisaneena closed school area.  Acocordingly, under the terms of the scheme, she was entitled to free transport to Ballinacarrow national school, the school of amalgamation.</P>
      <P>My Department has examined the eligibility of the children in question on a number of occasions, and is satisfied that they reside nearer to another closed school area than to Lisaneena. While the children in this case are eligible for free transport under closure and amalgamation conditions, their entitlement relates to another school, and not to Ballinacarrow national school.</P>
      <P>I regret, therefore, that the most my Department can offer in this instance is fare paying transport.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for a psychological service in the primary sector.  As an interim measure, 15 psychologists who are also qualified primary teachers have been recruited to work with my Department's Psychological Service for a period of three years.  This initiative has increased the number of primary schools which now have access to the help of an educational psychologist.  However, after the deployment of these additional psychologists, there is still a considerable number of primary schools without a schools' psychological service, including the school mentioned.</P>
      <P>In order to rectify this situation, I announced shortly after taking up office my intention to establish a National Educational Psychological Service.  Plans for this service, which is to be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to pre-school children, were included in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A planning group which includes representatives of all the partners in education has been set up with the task of preparing detailed recommendations for the development of the psychological service.  The work of the planning group <Col N="242" /> has now been completed and it is expected that it will report to me in the very near future.  Only when I have received its report, shall I make decisions about provision of funding to expand the psychological service.</P>

The special capitation rates applicable are £384 per pupil under 12 years of age and £413 per pupil of 12 years or over.  Capitation grants are paid on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that under the Schools IT 2000 initiative, the school in question has recently received an additional £1,500 plus £20 per special class pupil to facilitate the purchase of computer equipment.</P>
      <P>If, notwithstanding the above allocations, the school continues to have additional equipment needs, it should draw the specific needs in question to my Department's attention so that the matter can be considered.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document' An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, where I have provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education versus the 1997 budget allocation.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represents an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  However, it is important to note that the difference in grant level reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second-level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than in primary schools.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the pupil to teacher ratio in a school (details supplied) in County Meath where class sizes are now larger than they were in 1971; if he will provide the finance for remedial and resource teachers and guidance counsellors to alleviate the problems experienced due to lack of funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The teacher allocation to the school in question for the current school year includes ex-allocations in respect of guidance and remedial together with a concessionary allocation to cater for curricular needs within the school.  The actual teacher pupil ratio in the school is approximately 16.4:1.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education.  These demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints. Unfortunately, in current circumstances it is not possible to allocate additional ex-quota resource posts to second level schools.  However, the position will be kept under review and the position of this school will be considered when next it is possible to allocate additional resource posts.</P>
