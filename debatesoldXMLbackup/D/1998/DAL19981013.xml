    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>EU Commissioner Monica Wulf-Mathies will be in Cork on Friday, 16 October. I will meet with her during the course of that day to discuss a number of European related issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally invite the Taoiseach to participate in the European Socialist Party's seminar, which he is to address. If he so wishes, I would be happy to meet him there.</P>
      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's brief reply that he has not had any discussions with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies prior to that event on Friday about this matter ?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue relating to proposals on regionalisation, as I set out in Question No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a lengthy discussion on this matter with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in the early part of the summer when she visited Ireland. She met both myself and the Minister for Finance at that stage. Our officials have been in touch through numerous meetings. The Department of Finance, which has been dealing with this issue, has been in touch with the Commissioner's office on a regular basis. I have had discussions with her previously on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question specifically asked the Taoiseach if he intends to have discussions with the EU Commissioner with regard <Col N="3" /> to regionalisation.  Will he outline to the House what he considers to be a coherent argument for abandoning the unemployed in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, if he proceeds with the plans &mdash; which he has indicated he supports &mdash; for dividing this country between the west, the Border and the rest of the country?  Is the Taoiseach aware that CSO statistics indicate that of the 110 unemployment blackspots in this State, 85 are in the area south of a line from Dublin to Cork?  In other words, only 35 of them are in the area which the Taoiseach proposes to ensure continues to receive Objective One status, while the rest of the country will be abandoned to the sad and uncertain moods of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss regionalisation, and the other options the Government is considering, with the Commissioner.  With my Cabinet colleagues and the Commission generally, I will also talk about the excellent work we have been doing in recent years in urban blackspots with the help of EU funds.  This work includes the urban renewal initiative, Youthreach and the social and community employment initiatives.  All of these initiatives have helped to target disadvantage and we will continue to deal with them, I hope effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has rightly pointed out that European social funding has assisted with long-term unemployment, through initiatives such as Youthreach and others. However, these are the very schemes that will be hit and lost as a result of the proposals he is putting forward to divide this country in two.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that of the unemployed in this State, 35 per cent live in the Dublin region and more than half of those are long-term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy keeps referring to &ldquo;proposals that I have put forward&rdquo;, but I have not put forward any proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should consult his scriptwriter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We actually provided money for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these questions would be redundant if the Government was to publish in draft form the set of indicators and various other factors it wishes to take into account to maximise European Union support for this country, with which this House unanimously agrees.  Let there be no doubt about that.  Will the Government, either on Friday or arising from today's meeting, publish the draft proposals that may be before it, in relation to regionalisation, which among other things will require a devolution of democratic <Col N="4" /> powers to such regions?  Will the Government consider publishing those proposals in draft form before they are either formally submitted to the Commission or before a final Cabinet decision is taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so when the Government has finalised its deliberations on this matter. Today was the second day we have had discussions on it.  I know from my colleagues in Europe that nobody has put forward proposals. To put forward precisely what one will do in advance would, in the present position, be very stupid, to put it mildly.  We will not do that.  We are working through our proposals and looking at how best to maximise resources for the country, not just for the next period but for the long term. I stated yesterday that whatever way we handle the next round of negotiations, there will be many new initiatives.  We saw one such initiative last week in agriculture and there will be many more by those countries which do not want to pay as much as they are paying.  They will continue to do this within the 1.27. The President of the European Commission made it clear yesterday that these are the main issues.</P>
      <P>We must put our framework of negotiations together.  We are prepared to have a debate in the House or in one of the committees once our paper is ready and to listen to views before our negotiations.  The Government must make a decision on how best to handle this matter.  We are engaged in those discussions, considering the various issues and we will make a decision in time for the start of any negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Has the Government considered the partnership areas and Leader programmes as a basis for the categorisation of regionalisation?  Is it correct to assume the Government's intention is to shop around for the best form of maximising funds and, when that has been agreed, to construct a democratic regional devolved structure to fit into that system?  Is that a correct or incorrect inter-pretation of what the Taoiseach is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn knows it is not open to us to shop around for a system.  The criterion is firmly laid down that Objective One regions must be below 75 per cent of GDP for the period for which these figures relate &mdash; a few years ago.  That is the benchmark laid down by the Commission and it is not open to debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is unlikely to change.  We must consider the programmes, cases and national plans to present and maximise our efforts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other major initiative which I mentioned in the House, but which does not seem to have got through to some people, is that if after 2006 we decide not to have regional structures, we will <Col N="5" /> rule out areas, even those below 75 per cent of GDP which we know will continue to be relatively neglected, poor and disadvantaged, for resources.  We must examine areas that might be considered transitional Objective One regions and urban and rural blackspots which are under 75 per cent of GDP to know the best way to deal with them.  The Government is addressing these issues as we prepare for negotiations.  My Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and other colleagues are also doing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a number of areas outside the areas being considered for retention of full Objective One status have been classified under different EU schemes as either severely disadvantaged or disadvantaged and accepted as such by the EU?  What special arrangements will be made for those areas which exist in virtually all the 13 counties proposed to be excluded?  What are the implications for areas that do not secure Objective One status in terms of the rate of industrial grant they can receive?  Is there a risk that IDA Ireland or its successor will not be able to give industrial grants to areas excluded from Objective One status?  As regards on-farm investment grants against pollution, for example, will they have to be paid at a lower rate on farms which are on the wrong side of the Border in that they are not in an Objective One region?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these issues, because of the detail they involve, are matters for specific parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are offering the Taoiseach an agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions go to the heart of the choice which must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason the Chair believes they should be the subject of separate parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that these matters are under debate.  I am not aware that farm investment will be affected but I will check the position.  With regard to the other two points raised by the Deputy, urban or rural blackspots which may be situated in Objective One areas under transition must be given consideration because otherwise the schemes to which I referred earlier will face great difficulty.  I am acutely conscious that some of the worst blackspots in local authority areas in our cities &mdash; not merely Dublin &mdash; are experiencing extreme disadvantage which must be dealt with in whatever overall package is put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State aids is one of the issues I will discuss with the Commissioner.  I understand that State aids at the higher rate could not be paid to any area if the entire country was classified as a single region under Objective One status in transition.  Areas <Col N="6" /> can only be paid at the higher rate if they have been granted normal Objective One status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has returned to the issue of what will happen post-2006. He suggested on numerous occasions, when I raised the proposed 1.27 per cent extension of GDP for European Union countries contained in Agenda 2000 &mdash; which will result from the accession of new member states, etc.  &mdash; that I should forget about what will happen post-2006. The number of countries which will have already entered or will be about to enter the European Union at that stage will have GDPs 33 per cent smaller than Ireland's and this will make it virtually impossible for this State to retain its structural funding status post-2006.  It is highly irresponsible for the Government to engage in a smash and grab exercise on behalf of one part of the country when the money on offer could provide for those in need throughout the entire State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach guarantee that the Government will not make this decision in private, on the basis of lobbying from various groups, without having the views of Members expressed through the House and its committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago I devoted 50 minutes of Question Time to listening to the views of Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated at that stage that I would welcome it if the House decided to engage in a formal debate on this matter because I would like to see Members being forced to come to some of the difficult conclusions already drawn by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should provide time for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  The 1.27 per cent extension will have to occur before there is an enlargement in the Union.  On the numerous occasions on which the Deputy raised this issue I informed him that I do not see member states &mdash; particularly the net payers &mdash; agreeing to an extension of 1.27 per cent in the next round of funding.  After that, however, the position will be different and I believe enlargement will occur.  We must ensure that we do not close a door in this round of funding which will place us at a disadvantage in the next round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is closing the door on two thirds of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not closing the door. <Col N="7" /> The impact of Structural and Cohesion Funds must be placed in perspective.  This year Ireland's total gross public expenditure will be £16 billion, £1.2 billion &mdash; 7.5 per cent &mdash; of which will be co-financed out of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  It is not the case that all expenditure in an area will stop because it does not have Objective One, Objective Two or Objective Three status.  Is it not a little odd after all the years of Structural Funding that it was not EU funds which changed the most disadvantaged areas, particularly those in the Deputy's constituency, but Exchequer funds?  The development to which the Deputy has a great attachment in Ballymun will be funded by the Exchequer.  It will not receive funds from the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, since its membership of the European Union, Ireland has been treated as one region for the purposes of Structural and Social Funds support, that what the Government is engaged upon now is a fundamental change in a position which has existed since Ireland joined the Union in 1973, and that any change in the structures of the country will require a devolution of powers and a new democratic local government structure?  Accordingly, is the Taoiseach prepared to publish prior to any Government decision what the Government intends to do in relation to the structures involved, the kind of indices which will be used to delineate those new regions, and whether there will be a set of regions linked by social indicators or a set of regions linked on a purely geographical basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of negotiation between the Government and the Commission. The Deputy is correct in that there must be in place a special regional structure.  How major or minor that will be is still an issue of debate. Recently in the UK they have made that change on a minor structural basis for Cornwall and Devon.  It would seem that one must have in place a regional structure.  We will certainly have to put one in place before we could finalise that.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's other point, the reason breaking up the country is now on the agenda is that it has been made crystal clear by President Santer and several commissioners that if we do not do so this country will not receive any Structural Funds after 2006.  Ireland would be in transition as a single region until 2006 and thereafter we would receive no further funds for any region, regardless of whether it was over or under 75 per cent of GDP.  They are telling us that now so we can make the decision in the knowledge that we will have areas under 75 per cent and there is an opportunity for us to try to get for those regions funds on the other side of 2006.  That is the only reason there is a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach clarified with the Commission whether or not there is a cut-off <Col N="8" /> date for submission of proposals for Objective One status and regionalisation?  When does the Government hope to make a decision on Objective One status and regionalisation?  Has the Government any plans to develop regional administrative structures?  As stated earlier, there is no need for those regarding Objective One status, but has the Government any plans to develop such structures?  Can the Taoiseach clarify that there are two funds available for Structural Funds, one to which only Objective One regions will have access and a second to which Objective One regions in transition will have access?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the west, the midlands and the Border counties were left on the hind teat as far as Structural Funds were concerned on the last occasion and they now deserve a bite of the cherry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You see the dilemma, a Cheann Comhairle.  Of the issues which the Deputy raises, I have already answered the one on Structural Funds.  As far as a date is concerned, there is no date set.  The discussions are ongoing.  There was to be some discussion at the informal Council on the long weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are not too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. No country has put forward its negotiating position.  Nobody, neither the net beneficiaries nor those who are paying the costs, has shown their hand.  Some believe that this may be dragged out after 31 March.  I am totally opposed to that.  I would rather see it dealt with while the present Parliament and Commission are around.  They have made it clear that they need to do that by 31 March.</P>
      <P>The Government will come to its conclusions as soon as possible, after we have looked at all of the information available and taken everything into account, including the areas under 75 per cent, the Objective One regions as they are now, and the urban and rural blackspots.  Some people forget that there are also rural blackspots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that a formal proposal has not been made.  Will he agree that talk of regionalisation is an admission of failure of policies down the years to devolve power and have decentralised structures?  Will he include proposals to redress the demographic imbalance in the proposed plans?  There is a continuing trend towards the east, which is creating its own problems as well as depopulating the west.  Will he acknowledge that, in the long term, regionalisation will not solve the problems it is proposed to address unless there is a legal provision for local investment requiring financial institutions and banks to re-invest profits where they are made? Otherwise those Structural Funds will simply drift to the east again and out of the country, as has happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="9" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is credited with the best record over the past quarter of a century in the use it has made of Structural Funds.  Analysis after analysis has shown that this country has used Structural Funds, in city, country and the regions, more effectively than any other.  It is also the case that any region in Ireland which receives Objective One status for the next round will not receive the same <i>per capita</i> Structural Funds as the country as a whole received in the past.  This reflects the improved economic position.</P>
      <P>We have known for a long time that things have been changing and we must now look at the areas that are below 75 per cent of GDP.  While this is not the only factor &mdash; other factors have been taken into account in the past two rounds, including population, relative prosperity and unemployment levels &mdash; GDP is the main factor that is used as a benchmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Taoiseach confirm that two thirds of the funding in the next round will be designated to those areas assigned as Objective One and that one third will be designated to those areas assigned as Objective One in transition?  If the entire country is designated as Objective One in transition, the entire country will be fishing out of a smaller pool.  This means there will be less money to be distributed with a consequent net loss to the country.  However, if we draw down the maximum funds for those areas which now qualify for Objective One status while we designate the other half of the country as Objective One in transition we will have the best of both worlds and those areas with Objective One in transition will be able to target their black spots which hitherto have not received their share of the national cake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that is correct, but I do not believe it is.  The matter is still subject to negotiation so I cannot say if the Deputy is wrong.  However, we will not get any more money in the next round, regardless of the approach we take.  Objective One areas and Objective One areas in transition will feed from the same envelope.  The breakdown of the contents of the envelope is not clear at this stage. Given what I have heard from the EU Commission I believe it would make no difference, so this argument is a puff of smoke, although we are at the outset of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will make a difference if we have Objective One in transition for some areas and full Objective One status based on the 75 per cent of GDP criteria for others.  This will allow those areas to still be at the negotiating table post 2006.  Let the House be clear that if the country stays as one region we are saying to those areas under 75 per cent of GDP that they are out of the game. Those areas would fall into the sudden death category. That is the European term used to describe those areas.  We must decide if we will <Col N="10" /> put regions of this country into the sudden death category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Will the Taoiseach elaborate on what constitutes an area for this purpose, irrespective of whether it meets or is over or under the 75 per cent GDP criterion?  To date the debate has concentrated on counties.  Does the Taoiseach agree there is an important general principle involved here, that it is dangerous and divisive to proceed on the basis of an arbitrary and artificial division of the country to seek EU funding?  Does he agree it would be nonsensical to proceed on the pretence that poverty, marginalisation and social problems have been wiped out in Dublin, Cork or some rural areas and that to proceed on that basis would give rise to divisions, resentment and would further marginalise hard hit areas?</P>

      <P>That would be correct if all the money we got from Europe was all the money we put into areas with difficulties.  I gave the figure of total expenditure.  This year £11 billion of gross expenditure will be spent in the general area of social expenditure.  That constitutes a great deal of resources.  Of that amount only 2 per cent is co-financed.  Therefore, it is not the determining factor in how we use State resources to allocate social expenditure.  Two per cent of gross expenditure is £244 million and it is a great deal of money, but it is not the determining factor.  Whoever will be in Government, Minister for Finance or dealing with social expenditure will have to take account of black spots in certain parts of the country and will have to put resources into them. I said in reply to Deputy Quinn's question that the regional structure has not been worked out and it is important how the system will work in the regional area.</P>

      <P>It will have its own cost, but that will have to be structured and agreed by the Commission.  We cannot arbitrarily decide on that.  A Government will not state that one area has Objective One status and it is the only area to which we will allocate social expenditure and the rest of the country will be forgotten about. We do not do that now.  A total of 98 per cent of social expenditure is Exchequer funded and only 2 per cent is co-financed.  While Structural and Cohesion Funds are very useful, we are not dependent on them to the extent that they dominate every decision.  They have not done so in the past and there has been a decline in those funds in the past ten years.</P>

In recent weeks there has been some talk that it may be delayed.  I am opposed to it being delayed.  It should be finalised.  If it is not, it will drift into the year 2000 and then there will be many difficulties in regard to expenditure programmes.  It would not merely drift from March to June because the Commission and the various mechanisms of Parliament will move into their electoral processes in the autumn and it would be into the new year before the process would be resumed.  That is why it needs to be concluded.  Otherwise we will go into 2000 without an agreement and that would create an awful mess.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Following a number of meetings between officials of my Department, FÁS and <i>The Big Issues</i>, I wrote to the management of the magazine on 8 July 1998 to say that if it refocused exclusively on the production and distribution of the magazine, it would have the best possibility of resolving the serious problems facing the magazine and arriving at a viable solution.  I also said that if it was prepared, having examined this possibility, to focus exclusively on the magazine and prepare a viable action plan which would include its restructuring proposals to that end, I would be prepared to have my Department work with it, with FÁS and other public sector organisations, with the objective of arriving at viability involving a co-ordinated public sector response.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I received a response from the management of the magazine accepting the recommendation that it focus exclusively on the production and distribution of the magazine.  I then recommended that <i>The Big Issues</i> management and its accountants prepare a plan and present it to the agencies concerned, thereby providing an opportunity for assessment.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and FÁS held further meetings with <i>The Big Issues</i> management on 25 and 27 August to discuss its action plan.  The discussions were based on the undertaking received from <i>The Big Issues</i> management that it would focus exclusively on the production and distribution of the magazine and on the understanding that full information had been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> I have always supported the objectives of <i>The Big Issues</i> magazine and have been as sympathetic and supportive as I can be in helping it find a way out of its difficulties, which are grave.  The crisis at the magazine arose, at least in part, because of the involvement by its management in other activities and it was for this reason that I asked <i>The Big Issues</i> management to refocus on the production and distribution of the magazine. The undertakings given by the management of the magazine were fundamental to consideration for Government assistance.  It is regrettable that, because these undertakings were not fulfilled, it did not prove possible to commit further Government support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At any of the meetings that he attended did the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the Minister for Finance would provide financial assistance of approximately £300,000 to keep <i>The Big Issues</i> in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meetings I attended I had a strong desire to help the magazine in any way I could, particularly for the sake of the vendors. I was involved a long time ago when the social and community employment schemes were availed of.  Although most of the people concerned meant well and tried to help, unfortunately they had their hands in too many pies which stretched resources to the point where they could not be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they mistaken in thinking the Taoiseach had given an indication that they could expect financial assistance of approximately £300,000 from the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although figures were discussed with my officials, figures were not discussed with me.  Between £200,000 and £300,000 was needed to resolve the magazine's difficulties. I would have liked it to receive this, if everything had been in order and on the basis that the magazine was restructured and the full story told but for one reason or another it did not do so.  It became involved in other areas about which the Department did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this sorry saga highlights once again the need for legislation dealing with charitable status to enable us to see clearly which organisations are considered to be a charity and those which are considered to be a business?  Does he agree there is confusion as to whether <i>The Big Issues</i> was considered to be a charity or a business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As required under the law, <i>The Big Issues</i> had a memorandum of association which was to promote the welfare, well-being and relief of distressed people among the homeless, long-term unemployed and those on immediate release from prison by providing them with an occupational means of income and to aid in the provision of temporary and permanent places of <Col N="15" /> residence.  That was what it was engaged in.  It was not a charitable organisation within the terms of the old charitable bequests and donations legislation but it was intended to be non-profit making.  It became involved in a host of other activities which drained its resources and placed enormous liabilities on it until it reached a stage where it was impossible for anyone to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it would. There would still be a tendency for organisations to drift into areas which are not within their remit as stated in their memoranda of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the similar project in Britain extends into the area of advice on drug abuse, employment opportunities and so on as part of the overall project and that the magazines are distributed from a premises where vendors can get advice as well as purchasing magazines?  Would the Taoiseach agree that any scheme to help deprived people must have that sort of back up if it is to be part of the social services as distinct from a venture which may or may not make money?  This is the kernel of the problem.  The structure of a social service must be different from that of a commercial enterprise. Has the Taoiseach looked at that aspect of the overall management structure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not examined it in such detail.  I know that FÁS has tried to put expertise, professionalism and resources into organisations such as this and to structure them in a planned way.  <i>The Big Issues</i> tried to move into desirable but costly areas and it had neither the financial nor management resources to develop in that way.  Deputy Barrett seems to be saying that FÁS could help organisations like <i>The Big Issues.</i>  FÁS is involved with community employment and other schemes and most such organisations eventually come within the FÁS budget because people who are homeless or long-term unemployed normally get employment on schemes.  At the moment FÁS help with financial controls and auditing but it does not give the sort of advice which Deputy Barrett is speaking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask his Department to examine the manner in which the similar project is managed in Britain?  He may get an opportunity to report back to the House.  The project is worthwhile but it is important, if it is to be relaunched, that it is done in a viable fashion and that we know what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not really the responsibility of my Department.  <i>The Big Issues</i> became involved with my Department through its involvement in the Great Famine Project.  It had been advised by a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach in the last Government not <Col N="16" /> to become involved but it did not take that advice.  That was the beginning of the financial problems.  FÁS has been trying to help the organisation and I will make Deputy Barrett's views known to FÁS if we continue to assist it, even though we will not be giving the organisation State funds.</P>

Did the magazine vendors have any shares in it or was ownership confined to the small number of people who initiated the project?  Was the company ever commercially viable or did it always depend on State grants to stay afloat?  I return to Deputy Sargent's question and ask when we will have adequate charities legislation so that companies of this kind are bound strictly within the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fourth Pan-European Ministerial Conference in Aarhus covered a wide range of issues relating to the environment of Europe as a whole.  In so far as my Department is concerned, the main items for decision were the Convention on Access to Environmental Information and Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making, the <Col N="17" /> protocols on the control of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, and a programme for the phase-out of leaded petrol.  On behalf of Ireland, I signed the convention and the two protocols at Aarhus.  My Department is carrying out a detailed examination of the terms and implications of the ratification of the convention.  It is my intention to ensure Ireland is in a position to ratify it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the protocols on heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, I am satisfied that current and planned measures under Community and Irish law, including integrated pollution control licensing and control of products, are adequate to ensure compliance with both protocols.</P>
      <P>As Ireland is committed to phasing out leaded petrol by 2000, the 2005 deadline endorsed at Aarhus will not pose a problem.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of the conclusions relating to, for example, climate change, energy efficiency and participation in improved environmental monitoring at European level, will be taken into account in ongoing environmental management and protection measures.</P>
      <P>The conclusions adopted by the European and Japanese parliamentarians at their conference in Aarhus constitute a valuable contribution to the debate on environmental policy and I will have regard to them in the future formulation of relevant policy initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister regards the conclusions of the parliamentarians as an interesting contribution to the debate but does he intend to do more than that, particularly bearing in mind that in 1977, the Minister is listed as a member of GLOBE, which organised the conference? Will he pay particular attention to the conclusions of the parliamentarians regarding the integration of sustainable development into policy in all economic sectors, the use of sustainable development audits, measures to tackle endocrine disrupting chemicals, and preparation for the forthcoming COP4 conference in Buenos Aires?  Does the Minister intend to bring proposals before the House in view of those conclusions? Does he intend to take action to deal with the fact that, in spite of the conclusions of the Ministers at the Aarhus conference, few countries have put measures in place to control emissions, as they agreed to do at Kyoto, and that none of the major polluting countries has ratified the Kyoto protocol?  Will the Minister indicate what he intends to do about those areas as a result of the conference he attended in Aarhus?</P>

In relation to the conclusions of the parliamentarians, they also welcomed the ministerial decisions on access to information and protocols on heavy metals and stressed the importance of parliamentarians' involvement in the environment <Col N="18" /> for Europe process.  That is a process which I readily endorse.</P>
      <P>The other matters are already in hand, started in some cases by my predecessor through the sustainable development policy document which he launched, and in some cases since I came into office, particularly in the important area which the Deputy highlighted of integrating environmental policies across areas such as agriculture, energy and so on.  As part of that process we have set up the green network in Government Departments where, on an interdepartmental basis at Assistant Secretary level, group meetings and meetings on a bilateral basis are held on matters of policy which cut across those various areas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy rightly emphasises the importance of integration, not just at home.  It is an active and important issue being pursued at European level as well.  There has been a number of joint councils, particularly in relation to transport and energy.  I assure him these conclusions are welcome and are being implemented by me as part of the overall process of putting sustainable development at the centre of Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have over the years heard many calls for the declaration of a housing emergency or a housing crisis and any such declaration would achieve little, if anything.  What is required is well thought out effective action by Government in response to the prevailing housing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met a number of voluntary housing organisations who are seeking the establishment <Col N="19" /> of a national commission on housing and I have agreed to meet them again.  I am open to any useful ideas which will help to meet housing needs. The newly appointed NESC will, at an early meeting, consider a proposal for a study on housing. I understand preparatory work for such a study is under way in the NESC secretariat.</P>
    <P>The Government's housing priorities are set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and include a commitment to the deeply held aspiration for home ownership, a continuation of the local authority and voluntary housing programmes and more effective implementation of the social housing measures.</P>
    <P>My priorities since taking office have been to ensure urgent action in the problem areas including badly needed improvements in the range of social housing measures and the house prices issue which was tackled comprehensively with the Government's Action on House Prices.  This involved a three pronged approach designed to increase the supply of housing, reduce excessive investment demand and assist lower income house purchasers.</P>
    <P>I am also seeking increased resources for social housing in the context of the 1999 Estimates.  It is open to local authorities to acquire land for housing purposes and the acquisition and development costs of land for local authority, voluntary and private housing under the low cost sites scheme is met from existing capital allocations for these purposes.  I will consider ways in which local authorities might be further assisted in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the complacency of the Minister in what the world recognises as a housing crisis.  The Minister refuses to recognise that fact.  I am equally amazed that he feels the issue of house prices has been tackled comprehensively. The problem continues unabated.  Will the Minister accept the recommendation from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and other voluntary groups in the housing area to set up a commission on housing immediately?  Will he make that declaration now with a view to ascertaining what the State and the private sector can do to provide affordable housing and a mix of social housing in line with Government policy for successive administrations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 to 40, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 sets out a co-ordinated and prioritised range of policies and measures to improve road safety.  It establishes demanding targets for achievement within its period; these are designed to save at least 172 lives annually compared to a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario.</P>
      <P>Improving road safety is important in public health terms because an average 35 years of life is saved for each prevented road fatality: this represents a much greater saving of life than the prevention of any of the common life threatening diseases.</P>
      <P>International research establishes that human action is a contributory factor in more than 90 per cent of road accidents.  The strategy accordingly emphasises policies and measures aimed at improving road user behaviour and establishing a culture of road use that is both precautionary and pro-active in relation to road safety.  The strategy also aligns itself with road safety plans from other countries in recognising that the modification of human behaviour in the areas of speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing holds the greatest and most immediate potential for realising road safety gains.</P>
      <P>It is evident there is scope for considerable reduction of many vehicle speeds on Irish roads given the scale of speed limit exceedances being recorded by the National Roads Authority on the inter-urban network.  The Government's first priority therefore is to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits which have been comprehensively revised during the present decade and which are broadly in line with European practice.  However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of the existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of cutting present levels of excessive speeding by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Measures to counter speeding, which will include greater use of automated speed detection systems and of traffic calming, are calculated to account for some 29 per cent of the life savings targeted by the Government's strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Age and length of driving experience are important indicators of the likelihood of safe driving behaviour.  An EU survey shows Ireland to have one of the most experienced driver profiles in Europe, with the average driver having over 20 years driving experience.  Ireland has a relatively small percentage, 6 per cent, of its regular driving population under the age of 25. However this age group accounts for some 32 per cent of driver deaths, although the Garda report that there is no evidence of drivers on provisional <Col N="23" /> licences contributing disproportionately to road accidents.</P>
    <P>The Government Road Safety Strategy proposes improvements in driver training and testing, as well as in educational programmes, as complements to its primary counter-measures in relation to speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. Quality certification is being encouraged for the driver instructor register; a theory test will be introduced next year for first time applicants for provisional licences; and a significant reduction is proposed for the longer term in the number of drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
    <P>The strategy has not prioritised any change in the position whereby persons may drive unaccompanied for the period of a second provisional category B driving licence.  The estimated number of persons holding a second provisional category B driving licence for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 are 78,000, 83,000 and 90,000 respectively. Details of the numbers of such licence holders who would have failed a driving test within that period are not available.</P>
    <P>Some 23 per cent of all persons killed and injured on Irish roads are in the 15 to 24 age group.  The younger age groups are accordingly a target for much of the road safety education and awareness campaigns conducted by our public authorities.  The strategy proposes to intensify action of this kind through new inputs to be developed by the National Safety Council to both primary and secondary school curriculums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to fatalities among the 15 to 24 age group.  I wish to pursue two points with the Minister.  The Minister has repeated that this age group accounts for 23 per cent of all people killed on the roads and 32 per cent of driver fatalities.  Will he indicate what measures, if any, are aimed specifically at that category?  Will he indicate what measures he envisages to deal with the fact that that age group is also disproportionately represented among the people who, as pedestrians, are killed in traffic accidents?  The Minister has referred to speed controls, unmarked speed detection vehicles and traffic cameras.  Will he agree with me, and with an Assistant Commissioner of the Garda Síochána who takes the same view, that since prevention is better than cure, highly visible, prominent and marked Garda vehicles would do far more to reduce speeding than ones which people do not see until they are caught?</P>
      <P>We will come to this on a later question, but is the Minister convinced that in order to improve the quality of driving, it is now necessary for mandatory provisions and standards for the training of driving instructors and the preparation of driving testers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question on that point, to which we will come later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="24" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned it in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of deaths on the road, whether of young or old, drivers, motorcyclists or pedestrians, is a matter of major concern to everyone in this House and the promotion of road safety is supported by all parties.  There is need to change the attitude of road users and to change the culture as regards speeding, the use of seat belts, which is at a disappointingly low level, and driving after consuming illegally high quantities of alcohol.  We have targeted young people and there has been some culture change among that age group &mdash; they take a much more responsible approach to drinking and driving than hitherto, and one hopes that change will take place across society.  Young people are an important part of the Government's road safety strategy, they are being targeted and the National Safety Council is developing special educational packs for teachers and pupils at primary and second levels, which will also involve parents, in order to bring about this cultural change and to promote the need to exercise great caution when using the roads.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the number killed on the road has increased in the past three to four years and the Government will make every effort to get this message across.  The strategy commits us to provide a wide range of new resources &mdash; for instance, making greater use of information technology to assist in processing a greater volume of the Garda's enforcement work.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy &mdash; this is a personal view &mdash; there is need for a much higher profile on our roads to discourage those drivers who are tempted to exceed the speed limit and to apprehend those who drive after consuming alcohol. There is a commitment in the strategy to acquire additional vehicles which would have a high profile on the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the result of this increased effort will become more evident because it is a major deterrent.  It also involves the commitment of much more Garda time.  The Commissioner and the Garda have taken their own initiatives in this area, such as Operation Lifesaver which has been extremely successful.  I hope that level of enforcement can be achieved across the country. I agree the law enforcement agencies should have a higher profile on the highways but it boils down to the attitude of drivers to how they operate their vehicles and the courtesy they show to other road users.  Unfortunately we do not have the necessary level of courtesy and care to eliminate road deaths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree with the view put forward on a recent radio programme by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, about whether it is time to look again at the national speed limits, under which a 60 miles per hour limit applies on a bad county road and a national dual carriageway alike?  Would it not be more appropriate to look at the ability of these roads to take speed?  Is a review ongoing or is the matter being discussed in the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The high level group of experts who drew up the strategy for the Government did not recommend an immediate change in the current speed limits but emphasised the need to implement many of the proposals in the strategy. This is kept under review and if, after a reasonable period, many parts of the strategy are in place but speeding continues to be a major concern and cause of tragic accidents, the position will be reconsidered with a view to reducing the limits.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it is crucial that provisional licence holders be tested quickly?  On 5 March he told the House the delay was six months.  Is he aware that now, in October, the delay is eight months?  Does he accept the policies he put in place to effect change in this area are not working?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is 90,000 provisional licence holders, not the other figure mentioned by the Deputy.  When I previously answered questions about the waiting period for a driving test, I said the delay was most unsatisfactory and unacceptable but there was not much I could do about it while negotiations were continuing with the driver testers' union.  I am happy to inform the House those negotiations have been brought to a successful conclusion and arrangements have now been agreed which will result in increased productivity on the part of the existing cadre of driver testers.  This will also involve the employment on contract of additional driver testers to clear the unsatisfactory backlog which has developed.  Agreement has also been reached on the appointment of additional full-time driver testers and arrangements will be made in that regard with the Department of Finance and the Civil Service Commission.  We hope that will enable us to reduce the waiting period to our target, which is that people will have a test within ten weeks of applying.</P>
      <P>In regard to people who could show that they needed a driving licence to qualify for employment, tests were arranged wherever possible.  The House is aware of that.  The facility has been availed of by Members who approached the Department, and the Department has always cooperated in that regard.  Nevertheless, the length of time it took to get a driving test was excessive and that was because of the huge increase in the numbers seeking driving tests and the inability of the Department to keep up with that increase until a satisfactory arrangement had been entered into with the union representing driver testers.  I hope that we will now be able to reduce the list very quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered introducing a policy of randomly testing drivers' ability to drive once they have achieved a standard through the test?  Many drivers, having passed the test, take up the most pathetic driving habits when they are qualified drivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Inherent in the question is the suggestion that the fact that a person holds a driving licence does not mean he or she will always drive in an exemplary fashion.  The holding of a licence or otherwise is not deemed to be a factor <Col N="27" /> in the accident statistics of the Garda Síochána. The task facing me is to ensure that the existing driver testing system operates efficiently, before we start thinking about a new generation of tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 55, 60, 72, 73, 79, 80, 83, 90, 100 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry, Building Our <Col N="30" /> Future Together, was approved by the then Government and published in June 1997.  The committee was broadly based and representative of private and public clients, the design professions, contractors, unions, and building product manufacturers.  The report contained a total of 86 recommendations, including a recommendation that fixed price tendering should apply to fully designated projects with construction periods not exceeding 11 months.</P>
    <P>In October 1997, I established a broadly based forum for the construction industry to advise on and oversee the detailed implementation of all of the recommendations contained in the strategic review committee's report.  I understand that, at a meeting in early December 1998, the forum plans to finalise detailed proposals for the implementation of some 40 recommendations, including that on fixed price tendering.</P>
    <P>Both the forum and myself have received a considerable volume of representations about the fixed price tendering recommendation from the Association of Electrical Contractors (Ireland) and individual electrical contractors.  I do not want to comment on this specific recommendation at this stage until I have received and considered the forum's specific implementation proposals and report.</P>
    <P>In general terms, however, the 86 recommendations were agreed and adopted by the broadly based strategic review committee without formal dissent from any committee member.  They were subsequently accepted by the Government.  The committee's recommendations were approved for implementation as an integrated package.  There is a consensus between the construction industry and myself that the recommendations must all be implemented as a package, without cherry-picking specific recommendations which benefit some parties to the exclusion of certain recommendations which benefit other parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it had been proposed originally to implement at least some of these recommendations with effect from 1 September last?  Would he not agree that it shows the nature of the problem that now they have been postponed until December?  Could the Minister not accept that the proposals on fixed price tendering in relation to a high import content component of the work is one which may prove difficult, given the fact that sterling is not in the single currency system and the punt is? Would the Minister not agree that it would be entirely appropriate to make a safety net provision to deal with the difficulties that will arise for some contractors from that difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage was I aware that this report was to come to me by 1 September.  The date indicated to me by the chairman at all times was December and remains so.  In relation to the point raised by the Deputy, I would reiterate that everybody who sat on that committee produced a report and recommendations.  The current procedure <Col N="31" /> is about implementing those recommendations, not about opening up discussion on the recommendations themselves.  On the question of cherry-picking, if we go down that route, if anybody is seen now to be withdrawing their consent to one or other of the more than 80 recommendations, that would open up the whole procedure again, and I am not prepared to do that.  I accept that there may be particular difficulties, but it is open to individuals in this situation to make plans now to avoid the type of situation the Deputy fears might arise.  In particular, it is open to people to hedge against any changes that might take place in relation to the value of sterling as against the euro.  It is possible for them to source plant from any one of the other ten countries who will be EMU members, and thereby guarantee fixed exchange rates and so on.  In general terms, the energies of some of the people lobbying on this would be better spent on looking at those options rather than trying to change something they agreed to 12 months ago and which is part of an overall package of over 80 recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me on a view I have held for a very long time, that it is utterly unrealistic of any commission set up by any Government to say when it produces a report that all or none of it must be implemented?  That is pure farce. Would the Minister not agree that that would reduce the Government, and the Minister in this case, to a status to which one of his colleagues objected &mdash; it is not that long since we listened to a Minister in this House saying, &ldquo;I am not a rubber stamp&rdquo;.  Would the Minister not agree that what he is saying is that Ministers should become rubber stamps?  Would he not agree that the majority of member firms of the Association of Electrical Contractors (Ireland) are not in a position to forecast with any great confidence how much Government contract work they will be participating in over the 12 month period ahead?  Would he not agree that, in the nature of things, few of them are in a position to engage in hedging in the way major financial operators would?  Will the Minister agree he is being a little unrealistic in this regard and that he is in danger of making a federal case of what should be a simple problem to resolve?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being dealt with <Col N="32" /> within the committee.  The Deputy mentioned rubber stamping and so forth.  If rubber stamping was done on this report, it was done by the Government of the day and the Deputy was a member of that Government.  It was a good report and that Government was wise to accept its recommendations.  However, Deputies will agree that the report was carried out on the basis of give and take on all sides and that it represented the best view of the entire construction industry.  I agreed with that at the time and I still do.  Nobody should start cherry-picking.  It is a matter that should be resolved within the forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the strategic committee of the construction industry was established by the previous Government to examine efficiencies and cost effectiveness within the industry in order to mirror the benefits which resulted from the Latham report in the United Kingdom?  Will he accept that the boom in the construction industry in recent years has changed the dynamic somewhat and that this should be taken into account in the implementation of the committee's recommendations?  When I was Minister I was happy to endorse those recommendations and to bring them to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I defer to the Deputy's knowledge of the reason for the establishment of the committee.  Conditions in the construction industry have improved.  Huge growth rates have continued for a number of years.  Everybody is aware of the huge increase in volumes and in the value of the industry, which will be more than £9 billion this year.  The case we are discussing underlines the fact that we should go ahead and prepare for the downturn if it arrives.  These recommendations will help in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 58 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The scope and operation of the regulations relating to taxis and hackneys is kept under regular review by my Department.  The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, established a comprehensive revised framework for the licensing and operation of taxis and hackneys on the basis of a substantial devolution of policy and control to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Amendments made in 1997 and 1998 have changed certain criteria for the assessment of applications for new taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences and amplified and clarified the specification for wheelchair accessible taxis.  More recent amendments made in 1998 have simplified the requirements to be met by applicants for public service vehicle driver licences.  This included the removal of the requirement for applicants to undertake that they would be available to operate as public service vehicle drivers for at least 40 hours in each week.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Taxi Forum completed its work in August 1998 and addressed a comprehensive set of recommendations to various Departments, the Garda Síochána, local authorities and the service providers.  I am giving careful consideration to those recommendations as are the other public bodies.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State publish the recommendations of the Dublin Taxi Forum or at least refer them to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government so Members of the House will have an opportunity to debate them?

      <P>There is no reason for the recommendations not to be published but I will communicate again with the Deputy on the matter. The Dublin Taxi Forum was established on the Taoiseach's initiative and the report was given to him on 2 September.  The forum comprised a cross-community representative group and it recommended that there should be more taxis in the Dublin area.  It mentioned a figure which was greatly in excess of the current number.</P>

Is he also aware that the local authorities commissioned a report and wish to make their decisions on foot of that report's recommendations?  The decision-making process was postponed in deference to the forum set up by the Taoiseach, about whose purpose nobody was clear.  The local authorities waited until it received the forum's report.  Will the Minister of State postpone consideration of the forum's recommendations until the local authorities have time to make their own recommendations?

      <P>I intended to ask several questions on the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill in light of the murder trial completed yesterday. However, in view of the lacuna in legislation, does the Taoiseach intend that the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill will be tied in with a mental health Bill and that the two must go together regardless of whether one is completed?</P>

      <P>It is promised legislation, with all due respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and it is unusual for two Bills to be linked in this way. Will the Taoiseach clarify this matter because the drafting of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill has actually been carried out since 1996 and I would have thought it would be ready by now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an overlap between the two Bills.  It was decided following lengthy legal advice when they were drafting this legislation to give preference to a Mental Health Bill. I hope a Mental Health Bill will be ready before the end of this session.  Then the other Bill, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill will be completed at some time in the middle of next year.  I do not think that is a long Bill, but it will be ready after the Mental Health Bill.</P>

      <P>The drafting of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill took place some considerable <Col N="47" /> time ago, perhaps as long ago as 1996, but then it ran into legal difficulties.  It was decided because of the overlap that the Mental Health Bill should take precedence and then that Bill was moved forward.  The intention now is to take the Mental Health Bill as quickly as possible &mdash; I hope before the end of this session &mdash; and then it will be followed by the other one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I welcome the Bill.  Legislation is required to control the carriage of all types of goods.  Those in the haulage business are, by and large, reputable.  They do an excellent job and have quality lorries and transport mechanisms for the transport of goods which can be considered dangerous.  These include toxic and acid based substances.  One is usually aware of such vehicles because they are generally well marked. I compliment those involved in that type of haulage.</P>
      <P>However, it is necessary to question the safety aspects of the haulage of some other goods. There continues to be a lethal problem with oil spillages in the Border region, but the cause has not been discovered.  It has been indicated that lorries from Northern Ireland are overfilling with diesel oils, although I do not believe that is the main problem.  I have no difficulty with people purchasing their diesel fuel on that side of the Border.  However, there appears to be a regular trade in hauling diesel substances in unsuitable containers from the Border to Virginia, Cavan and Kells along the N3 and other less important roads.</P>
      <P>I have encountered a number of accidents where cars have slid off the road because of oil spillages.  When that happens the local authority and fire services are contacted immediately and, at significant cost, the oil is mopped up and a chalk substance is placed on the surface of the road for approximately one mile.  I understand these oils are being hauled in unsuitable milk tankers. This must be stopped because it is making the roads very dangerous.  Serious accidents have occurred on the N3 because of oil spillages.  Perhaps the relevant authorities would examine the matter and those involved should be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When major roadworks take place some lorries carry large boulders.  While the lorries involved are well maintained and in excellent condition, they are not designed to carry such heavy loads. If they have to stop suddenly part of the load <Col N="50" /> could fall off.  Loads should not overhang the sides of a lorry.</P>
    <P>In some cases insufficient care is taken to secure steel and steel girders on haulage lorries. It is not unusual to see lorries on the road on which the ties holding the loads have snapped.  If a steel girder were to fall off lives could be lost. Again, it is a question of overloading lorries to take larger loads from one destination to another in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Lorry drivers are under great pressure and some of them are paid on commission rather than at a flat rate.  There is pressure on them to travel fast on the roads.  It is not uncommon to be over-taken by a lorry, even when travelling at 60 miles per hour.  It has been suggested that, because lorry drivers are seated high in their vehicles they have a far greater view than car drivers.  If an animal or child appeared on the road unexpectedly, trucks travelling at 70 or 80 miles per hour could not stop over a short distance.  Lorry drivers must be prepared for the unexpected.</P>
    <P>I admire those who get on with their work and try to make a living and I do not wish to curtail them.  However, it is not acceptable that lorry drivers should be effectively held up to ransom because they are paid a commission on the number of loads they deliver a day.  They should be paid at a flat rate and given a decent day's wages for doing their job safely.  Those were the points I wished to raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Boylan as a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  Tá sé ceithre bliana ó tháinig Treoir '94 55 EC ar an saol agus ní leor é a chur i bhfeidhm sa Bhille um Iompar Earraí Contúirteacha de Bhóthar, 1998.  Caithfear cur leis mar tharla go leor rudaí idir an dá linn, agus tá sé tábhachtach iad sin a chur san áireamh sa Bhille nua.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable the Bill is not entitled Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail because often rail is a more appropriate means than road for the transportation of freight and hazardous goods.  A number of European countries give special incentives to encourage companies to take that option.  Road transport arrangements for dangerous goods will always have to take account of a substantial imponderable, the behaviour of other road users.  Because of deficiencies in driving licence applications tens of thousands of those in charge of motor vehicles are inadequately licensed and that has serious implications for the transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
      <P>The first question concerning the transportation of dangerous goods by road should always be, could this be done more safely by rail.  That question raises another, why is investment in road transport vastly disproportionate to investment in public transport, including rail.  I will not give the long answer I could give to that because I have only a few minutes to make my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State investment in road transport, in effect, is a subsidy to those industries which use road transport <Col N="51" /> to move goods, including dangerous goods. It must be recognised that it is a subsidy to industry which is financed by the excessive taxation of ordinary working people.  It is worth noting that a firm of consultants, International Risk Management Services, is close to completing a strategic review of all aspects of rail safety at the behest of the Minister for Public Enterprise and it is due to be published later this month.  It speaks volumes about the rather casual attitude of successive Governments to road safety that a similar review of the carriage of dangerous goods by road has not been undertaken.  It is a habit of mind that road transport is seen to be the obvious choice even when full consideration of the collateral cost of road transportation would often indicate that the public interest is not best served by the choice of road over rail.  A proper balance must be struck between the two.  Unfortunately, this Bill concentrates on road transport only.</P>
    <P>A number of specific aspects of the Bill must be considered.  There is a lack of inspection and enforcement of the regulations governing the transportation of hazardous waste by road.  That is not addressed in the Bill, but it must be addressed through other provisions.  Damage to roads can also cause accidents.  It was mentioned on the radio yesterday that the speed at which lorries travel is often excessive.  Even though we are told there are checks and so on, the regulations do not seem to be enforced.</P>
    <P>Herbicides, pesticides and different chemicals are transported in bulk by road.  I spoke to a fire safety officer about this and was told that the inventory on chemicals transported by road is not up to date.  Many dangerous goods are transported by road and if a vehicle carrying such goods was involved in an accident, it would cause problems for the emergency services because they might not know exactly how to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pesticides will no longer be used now that there is genetic engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not speaking the truth.  I wish I could believe everything he says. Fluoride, a product that is in our drinking water, is hazardous when transported by road, and a vehicle transporting it was involved in an accident recently.  It is ironic that substance, which is toxic when transported, is in our drinking water.</P>
      <P>Regulations governing the transportation of animals by road are not clearly specified in the Bill.  There was a serious accident last year involving a lorry and a trailer transporting sheep.  Speed is a factor in many of these accidents.  Enforcement of the speed limit is needed to ensure goods and animals are transported safely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transportation of large items, such as prefab units for use during road building, can also be dangerous.  That is not specifically addressed in the Bill.  As Deputy Boylan said, the transport of <Col N="52" /> such large items is dangerous, particularly when the vehicle carrying them is traveling at speed.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about the parking of dangerous goods vehicles in residential areas. That should be addressed in the Bill.  It should not only provide for the transport of dangerous goods by road but also the parking of vehicles carrying dangerous goods.  Special parking spaces for such vehicles need to be provided sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this technical but important Bill.  It puts in place the legislative framework to enable Ireland become a contracting party to the ADr. It involves two European Union directives. That highlights how much of our law originates in the Commission and other institutions of the European Union.  All Departments are constantly taking on board new directives and issues which originate in Europe and that is beneficial.  There is no doubt the European Union has been an engine for modernisation.  This Bill deals with the health and safety of our citizens and in that regard the involvement of the European Union is particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to ensure that dangerous goods, while in transit on our roads, adhere to the highest standards.  This is particularly important in urban areas, particularly in residential parts. Many residents in urban areas have to put up with noise and pollution from heavy good vehicles. This Bill highlights that they also have to cope with the risk of an accident involving a vehicle carrying dangerous substances.  That is a constant fear, particularly in the inner city close to Dublin Port, but also throughout the country.  Many houses are sited only a few feet from the main road and some of the trucks transporting dangerous goods are bigger than those houses.  There is the possibility such trucks could be involved in an accident and many people consider that an unacceptable risk.</P>
      <P>There are many accidents on our road, as was highlighted in public debate this year.  I welcome the publication of The Road to Safety, the Government strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I hope it will have some impact in reducing the number of road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of our unprecedented level of economic growth, road haulage has increased dramatically in the past ten years relative to the use of public transport and railways which has declined.  The list of dangerous goods that come under the ambit of this Bill is rather frightening. It includes explosive substances and articles, gases, flammable liquids, flammable solids, substances liable to spontaneous combustion and substances which when they come into contact <Col N="53" /> with water emit flammable gases, oxidising substances and organic peroxides, toxic and infectious substances, radioactive material, corrosive substances and other dangerous substances.  It is rather frightening that trucks which carry those dangerous substances pass very close to households. Therefore, this Bill is necessary to harmonise the law throughout the EU.  Deputy Sargent mentioned railways which are important.  In the inner city areas close to the port, railways run close to residences.  The fear of an accident or a derailment is a real one for many living in those localities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Investment in railways is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, especially when one considers the road haulage statistics compared with railway transit figures.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with packaging, labelling, vehicle construction and the technical requirements which need to be met.  The Minister outlined the derogations Ireland negotiated to cover the transport of ammonium nitrate, fertiliser, dispensing gases carried on the same vehicle as beverages, transport of low level radioactive material to hospitals and transport of clinical waste.  Why did we seek derogation in those cases?  The question of radioactive material and clinical waste concentrates the mind of residents in the vicinity of a hospital.  We need to be clear about why we are not including the disposal of radioactive material and clinical waste in this provision.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the enforcement of this legislation. There is a great deal of law on our Statute Book and we have passed many Bills in this House since the foundation of the State, but one wonders whether all this law is being enforced.  I travelled the Dublin-Limerick road last August behind a truck which spewed diesel for 20 miles over the cars behind.  Nobody could stop the truck but eventually a brave motorist passed it and stopped the driver because he was causing untold damage to cars and putting a great number of people at risk.</P>
      <P>We may have rules and regulations on the Statute Book but unless they are enforced by the Garda Síochána, they will be to no avail.  It is important that the Garda enforce this legislation and treat it as a critical matter as far as the health and safety of our citizens is concerned.  The old Irish attitude of &ldquo;it will do and it will be all right&rdquo; is fading fast, which is good.  When we are dealing with health and safety issues, we cannot leave anything to chance.  I ask the Minister to be conscious that this law must be enforced and the Garda must take appropriate action.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the transport of goods by rail or the transport of nuclear waste at sea.  This is an issue I would like to discuss but I cannot as it is not covered by the Bill.  Most people are concerned about what is transported on our seas, particularly nuclear waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned the parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas.  Article <Col N="54" /> 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, prohibits the parking of large vehicles in areas where the relevant traffic signs and information plates are erected.  Under the regulations, the signs and information plates must be erected at the entrance to these areas and a further sign and plate must indicate where the prohibition ends.</P>
    <P>Members of Dublin Corporation were concerned about these provisions and we sought a blanket ban of the parking of trucks throughout the city and a specification of where trucks could park &mdash; which is a reverse of the present system. However, we were told by the Minister that he had no immediate plans to change the regulations and that it may not be possible for him to introduce a blanket ban.  Individual proposals to prohibit the parking of heavy vehicles will be considered by the corporation as they arise.  We will see a proliferation of these signs throughout the city which is unfortunate.  However, if we can get trucks out of residential areas, many residents will be happy.  This is a new development and I am glad local authorities are finally grasping the nettle on this issue.  Parking articulated trucks on residential roads causes untold nuisance to house-holders. I hope we will be able to do something about that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward.  It is a technical Bill but a necessary one.  I hope we can all feel safe in our homes and on the roads as a result of this Bill being passed.  I hope it is rigidly enforced by the Garda Síochána.</P>

It is not before time such a Bill was introduced considering the number of accidents on the roads.  It is good that we are meeting the highest standards of safety for large trucks.  There is more traffic on the road because of the economic boom and in many areas the road infrastructure cannot cope with current levels.</P>
      <P>Nobody predicted the economy would boom as it has.  However, people are concerned by the huge trucks rolling in and out of small towns, going through urban areas and travelling at high speeds on rural roads.  People do not know what they contain or what safety standards are applied. They block roads and add to the number of accidents, causing a great deal of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue mentioned by Deputy Haughey and Deputy Sargent.  I have always been puzzled as to why we have not properly invested in our rail network.  Rail transport is a safer, easier way of transporting dangerous and heavy goods than road transport.  That method is used all over Europe, but for some reason we seem to have a mental block about our railways.  If it could be done here, the volume not alone of dangerous but heavy goods would be reduced, eliminating the need for some of the investment in our roads.  The number of commuters in <Col N="55" /> private cars would also be reduced, easing traffic congestion in urban areas.  When one considers what is being done on mainland Europe the lack of investment by the Conservative Government in the United Kingdom in the rail network becomes apparent.  It was one of its biggest mistakes. Neither did it invest in the education system. Each month Members receive a copy of a magazine on the European rail network which makes interesting reading on how the network is being used to best advantage.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with packaging and labelling are in accordance with Annex B of the agreement.  There have been a number of accidents in my constituency involving heavy goods vehicles and in some instances it took a long time to discover if the goods being carried were dangerous in circumstances where there was liquid on the road.  Vehicle construction, equipment and operation are also covered.</P>
    <P>Contracting parties are required to regulate or prohibit, for reasons other than safety during carriage, the entry of dangerous goods into their territory. Under the agreement transport operations remain subject to national and international regulations applicable in general to road safety, international road transport and international trade. The provisions governing multi-modal operations are to our benefit.</P>
    <P>Driver training is well covered.  The standard is high but it will be further improved as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Up until now out of State hauliers have been able to do whatever they want without fear of prosecution.  The strict penalties set out in the Bill are long overdue.  Out of State hauliers may now be arrested and brought before the courts.  Irish drivers are clobbered if they break the law abroad.  They complain that out of State hauliers escape scot-free here.</P>
    <P>Deputies Sargent and Haughey mentioned the parking of large trucks in urban areas.  This is a major issue at Dublin Corporation level.  There are no controls in place.  In one case if the driver of a truck bringing cars to a break-up yard in Marrowbone Lane was late arriving he would leave the truck in a residential area.  He did this for about nine months.  Eventually he was threatened with prosecution.  It proved extremely difficult to get him to move.  This is an issue that should be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I live along the Ravensdale section of the Dundalk-Newry road which carries the largest volume of traffic in the country.  This Bill which I welcome and which is being introduced at the instigation of the European Union adds to the mountain of Bills which have been enacted but whose implementation and enforcement are not being monitored.  I refer in particular to the drinking laws.  If enforced, a Garda car would have to be placed outside every public house in the country.  While I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill, will it be <Col N="56" /> enforced?  I fail to see how it will given that there are only four inspectors.  Will other personnel, including members of the Garda Síochána, be provided with the necessary training?</P>
      <P>While great strides have been made in recent years in providing top-class roads and flyovers, many of our roads were built for the pony and trap.  The playing field <i>vis-a -vis</i> mainland Europe is not level.  Huge lorries traverse the narrowest of roads.  I have long been deeply concerned at the number who lose their lives on our roads. There is an acceptance that it is inevitable people will die.  To date this year 14 times the number of people killed in the Omagh atrocity &mdash; 29 &mdash; have been killed in fatal accidents without any hysteria or concentration in the media.  Deaths on the road are now so commonplace they are no longer even a nine day wonder.</P>
      <P>A large number of those deaths result from accidents involving lorries.  On the road between Dundalk and Dublin, which I travel regularly, the speed at which lorries travel is horrifying.  They travel in convoy and because of their size they are quite frightening to car drivers.  Does the Minister know if it is legal for large vehicles to travel in convoy?  It is frightening to attempt to pass a lorry travelling at a great speed only to meet another large vehicle coming in the opposite direction.  If we are serious about reducing the numbers of deaths on our roads we must have a highway patrol.  I wonder why we allow the importation of cars which can travel at speeds up to 140 mph when the speed limit is 60 mph?  This is like asking children not to play with a loose bomb.  Children will play with such things and people will drive too fast if there is no deterrent.  I drive too fast myself on occasion.  We see large numbers of adolescent boys driving with their right arms resting on the open car window, putting on the style.  They will continue to drive too fast unless they are deterred by a permanent highway patrol similar to those in France and Germany where persistent offenders have their cars confiscated. We have removed deterrents in too many areas of Irish society.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Eoin Ryan's suggestion to develop the rail system.  He rightly contrasted our rail system with those of other European countries. The illogicality of previous administrations' decisions to downgrade and sometimes remove the rail network is now clear.  The complete removal of the rail network from County Donegal was particularly unfortunate because it effectively cut the county off from what might be called the Irish mainland and certainly from the capital city.  The beautiful county of Donegal, arguably the loveliest county in Ireland, has suffered greatly as a result of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is a firm obliged to notify the Garda if a dangerous substance is being carried in one of its vehicles and do the gardaí provide a flanking escort to ensure the safe passage of such lorries through towns with narrow streets?  This is absolutely necessary.  While there has been no really serious accident involving dangerous substances <Col N="57" /> in recent times the possibility of such a catastrophe remains.</P>
    <P>Once more I draw the attention of the House to the speed at which lorries travel.  This is particularly true of lorries from Northern Ireland. When these vehicles cross the border their drivers are often under great pressure to reach a port in time for a sailing or to deliver their loads at a certain time.  They break the speed limit, intimidate other motorists and are often a contributory factor in the escalating rate of deaths of the road. It is not the purpose of this Bill to counteract this practice but I hope the Minister will bring forward legislation governing the use of lorries regardless of whether they are carrying dangerous substances.  I anticipate letters to the paper criticising my comments and I know there are many responsible lorry drivers.  However, the presence of irresponsible lorry drivers on the roads is frightening to other road users.  I hope meaningful legislation will be introduced to establish a highway patrol.  Every driver needs a deterrent if the unacceptable rate of road deaths is to be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill by which we give effect to two directives and accede to the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road &mdash; ADr. It is essential to legislate for the transport of dangerous goods across national boundaries and within our own country.  We are approaching a time when all dangerous goods will have to be listed, labelled and prioritised in order of their degree of danger.  It is important that the required handling methods and equipment are listed in the Bill.  The fact that the Bill deals with bulk substances which come into the country is an indication of growth in many sectors of our economy. Because dangerous substances are imported in bulk form their transportation on our roads poses a great danger.  We must legislate in the interest of the health and safety of lorry drivers, companies and the general public.</P>
      <P>Legislation involving a mechanism for the inspection of safety equipment, proper education for drivers and company operators and a number of officers to police it places a further burden on the haulage industry.  Haulage companies must spend more money on equipment and on educating staff.  With the legislation must come a proper policing mechanism and this must be made very clear in the Bill.  The Minister said the legislation provided for four inspectors.  Because we are dealing with bulk hazardous goods, we should specify where these people are to be trained, how they should operate, the number of stops they should make when driving through the country, whether they are dealing specifically with imported goods and if they will extend their activity to the internal distribution of dangerous goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation currently in place is not being properly policed and, as a result, a mixture of dangerous and non-dangerous goods are being <Col N="58" /> transported in the same container.  There is little evidence of policing of the internal distribution of hazardous goods.  There are examples in the industry of hazardous goods being transported with less harmful goods every day without any paperwork or any indication on the vehicle.  Few penalties have been imposed on companies which operate on a daily basis in a fashion contrary to the current legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that consignors are responsible for selecting carriers that adhere to the criteria laid down in legislation but there is little evidence in the marketplace that people who use this service go to the trouble of determining that the operators they use operate within the law.  Some companies are not bothered about this once they get their goods transported from the place of production to the customer.  As a result, the laws we pass in this House are being broken on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of trained, certified drivers in this country.  Currently it is difficult for a company to take up any of the Hazchem courses because companies operating in this field, which are extremely busy due to the current economic boom, would have to do without their drivers for up to three days to allow them become certified. We, as legislators, should be conscious of that and we must be careful that we do not create a problem by ignoring the fact that there is a shortage of drivers and courses and that the system currently in operation is not easily accessible by the various companies involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to cost, the Government will have to examine the possibility of putting in place some type of grant-aid system for the industry to ensure companies wishing to operate within the law are given every opportunity to put their employees through the various courses, acquire certification and improve the standard of operators on our roads.  This can be done through FÁS, by way of direct payments or through an educational process whereby the current system would be extended to give greater availability of courses to interested companies.  If we do not do that, we are asking operators to adhere to legislation without giving them the necessary back-up.</P>
    <P>There is also need to ensure the operators of companies involved in the transport of dangerous goods are given an opportunity to take up specialised courses on which they will be given an overview of the legislation currently in place and the requirements placed on their companies by virtue of that legislation.  In having that overview they will be in a position to insist that key members of staff take up in-house training which will ensure the office staff, for example, who take in the various shipment orders, are aware of the way in which hazardous goods are to be handled in their warehouse and delivered to the customer.  These courses are needed because not only should the drivers responsible in this area be educated but also the people who control the general operation of the business.  If we are to be successful in ensuring this legislation is properly enacted and <Col N="59" /> given meaning in the marketplace, we must put in place the necessary support mechanisms which will enable companies participate fully in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is provision for an on-the-spot fine of £150 but substantial fines should be imposed not just on domestic hauliers but also on international hauliers.  If someone is in breach of the law a serious financial penalty should be imposed on them and that should be laid down in legislation. The buck stops with the operator or the managing director of a company and they should be penalised in some way.  There should be a serious penalty on every company or factory handling dangerous goods if they breach any aspect of this legislation.  If that is not done, we will encourage people to break the law.</P>
    <P>There are cowboy operators in the industry and they seem to operate without any sanction being taken against them.  They use redundancy money or take out a loan and set themselves up as operators in the transport industry without acknowledging any laws or regulations.  There is little evidence of the industry being properly policed.  I am aware of companies whose trucks are fully licensed, whose drivers are certified and who want to have a licence to carry dangerous goods, whether it be in bulk or in a group operation, but there is little evidence of the State co-operating fully with them.  There is evidence, however, of people not co-operating in this regard.  They operate in the industry without displaying any responsibility and in a fashion that is contrary to the general good of the industry for which we are legislating today.  Mention was made earlier of trucks containing dangerous chemicals being parked on the side of the road.  Goods are also loaded in a dangerous manner without any respect for health or safety and it appears that nobody, not even the Department officials, is scrutinising this area.</P>
    <P>Today's market is driven by a rates structure and payment for services rendered which cannot be sustained.  People in the industry are operating against the clock.  They want to pick up the goods and deliver them to the customer with the least amount of paper work or policing.  If we are to put this in place and make it meaningful, we must ensure the operators who do not comply with the legislation are rooted out.  We must also ensure the organisations which distribute the goods &mdash; the factories and warehouses &mdash; understand the mechanism in which they are becoming involved. We must ensure those who break the law, assist in the breaking of the law by allowing their tachographs to be used incorrectly and ignore the legislation in the various areas of operation are rooted out.  Unfortunately some of them, who are licensed operators, do this to meet a very competitive rate structure.  Until the cowboy operators are policed out of the market there will not be a proper rate structure in place which will sustain an industry capable of ensuring that all the legislation we pass is implemented, drivers are <Col N="60" /> trained and loads are safely conducted from A to B without infringing upon local government planning regulations for housing estates in breach of general Department policy.</P>
    <P>Four inspectors to police this legislation is inadequate. There must be an inadequate number of inspectors at present because the legislation currently in place is not being policed to the satisfaction of the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>While we may put in place all the regulations required, Europe has a role to play.  If we pass the legislation, and if this State signs up to it, surely Europe has a role to play in funding the issues which I have raised &mdash; training, education, the provision of proper equipment and ensuring the consignor and the consignee are aware of the requirements.  As the legislation filters down from Europe, with it must come the accompanying finance to ensure the industry is in a position to educate itself.  We have a responsible industry, one which will respond to legislation.  It has done so in the past and most of the operators who fall within the licensing structure of the Department are willing to co-operate.  When a State such as ours signs up to this legislation, the onus should be on Europe to ensure the proper funding is available.</P>
    <P>I join other Deputies who highlighted the problem of speed on the roads.  Most bulk containers are carried on roads in 40 foot containerised vehicles at speeds which are totally unacceptable. When we are experiencing such carnage on the roads, the problem is fuelled by many of these containers breaking the law by speeding.</P>
    <P>A further indication of the law being ignored is that a vehicle's speed governor can be removed so the driver is no longer bound by the speed control. There is a case for ensuring truck manufacturers install a mechanism which cannot be tampered with in terms of the speed these vehicles can reach.  It is a wonder some of the trucks driving through my area, on the way from Kilkenny to Dublin, travel safely from one place to the other without an accident &mdash; they use the fast lane to pass cars which are already speeding.  While there has not been a major accident involving the transportation of dangerous goods in recent times, it is only a matter of time before it happens if we do not ensure the law is adhered to.  There is a genuine concern that trucks are passing through towns, villages and cities at frightening speeds.</P>
    <P>In many cases there is need to predetermine a vehicle's route if it is carrying a bulk load.  There should be a detailed routing mechanism so the vehicle operator and the owner of the company is forced to comply with the regulations and the route imposed, diverting it from housing estates. While there is limited legislation at present to divert chemical and other dangerous loads, it should be extended to ensure most loads of dangerous goods are routed in a similar manner. That would be welcome legislation which would deal many of the problems faced by local authorities. It would certainly be a relief in city areas, <Col N="61" /> through which the traffic is forced, to know that such traffic would no longer use those areas.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation but ask that, in future, we go further with it and try to encompass the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this legislation, the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Bill, 1998.  The three initiatives he has taken are most welcome, including the implementation of European directives 94/55 EC and 95/50 EC.  Overall we are acceding to the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that under successive Governments we have provided a great deal of funding for roads, particularly national primary and secondary routes.  The transport industry has received major benefit from this investment.  For that reason I was surprised the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority were not mentioned often in the legislation.  When we discussed the charging of fees by competent authorities in section 5 of the Bill, I felt that those bodies would have a say in the appointment of inspectors.  We are told in the Bill that the inspectors will be appointed by the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The other two organisations mentioned are the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The Minister might indicate why the Department of the Environment and Local Government is not involved.  That Department has drawn up plans under various Ministers to provide funding for our road network.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of pressure to complete the major by-pass road programmes which the Department of the Environment and Local Government has planned for some time.  As a western Deputy I am most familiar with the by-pass at Kinnegad.  I am pleased there are plans to provide a temporary by-pass next year.  It is most frustrating for a truck driver with a cargo of dangerous goods to be stuck in a traffic jam for many hours when a by-pass would solve the problem.  It is significant that much of the pressure for the Kinnegad by-pass is from Galway city.  Business people in Galway recognise the major delays at Kinnegad when travelling from Galway to Dublin and <i>vice versa.</i> Loughrea, in my constituency, is earmarked by Galway County Council for a by-pass.  I hope the necessary funding will be provided in the not too distant future.  There is much pressure from Galway Chamber of Commerce and Galway Corporation to speed up the delivery of goods between Galway city and Dublin.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the truck drivers who work unsocial hours to avoid traffic congestion travelling from east to west and <i>vice versa.</i>  This has avoided many serious problems and the choking of smaller towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> I reiterate what has been said about the importance of the railways.  The whole question of carriage of dangerous goods could be solved by a more efficient and modern railway system.  I recall when the railway was the only means of transport for goods and materials to the Asahi plant in Killala.  In the past the railway was the preferred option for the carriage of coal and cement.  As we head into the next century the carriage of timber should be promoted by rail.  While we may not reach our planting target by the year 2002 &mdash; more and more timber has been growing in the western region &mdash; Coillte can procure enough timber to supply Louisiana Pacific in Waterford, the plant at Clonmel and Masonite in Carrick-on-Shannon.  This product is most suitable for transport by rail.</P>
    <P>Nowadays large trucks which carry timber and heavy and dangerous goods damage our roads. Those involved in the timber processing industry complain that the railways are not suitable, particularly the Sligo-Limerick line, which would serve many of the plants to which I have referred. The Sligo-Limerick line could be developed as a Euro rail link since it can link up with Rosslare port which is an access point to the Continent. Given that funding has been provided for some of the major railway lines out of Dublin perhaps the Euro route from Sligo-Limerick can be considered.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a member of the western inter-county railway committee, the secretary of which is Fr. Michéal Mac Greil, the well-known historian, who is passionate about railways.  He hopes the railway can help the development of the west.  He has plans not only for carrying timber but for carrying people.  The line has not been used since the mid-1970s.  There is a great future for that line given the extra business in the western and north western regions.</P>
    <P>I hope the development of railways will ensure tourist areas in the west will have greater access from Rosslare.  One of the problems experienced by those arriving at Rosslare is getting a transport connection to the west.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that driver training and driver examination is dealt with in the Bill.  This is an area which has been the subject of much criticism.  Recruitment of four additional inspectors for the purpose of enforcing the legislation is provided for in the Bill.  Given the shortage of certified drivers it is important that the Minister and his Department address that issue as quickly as possible.  Mention of inspectors means the legislation must be enforced.  If inspectors are to deal with this matter in a realistic way there must be realistic fines and penalties.</P>
    <P>Recently there have been many horrific accidents. These have involved not only truck drivers but drivers generally.  I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the statements he has issued in this regard.  Given that we are all drivers, I hope we can make this matter a priority of the Dáil.  I hope the suggestion about education courses for new drivers will <Col N="63" /> lead to a reduction in the huge cost of insurance claims.  There is much to be gained from having additional inspectors.  I hope, following the education courses, drivers will be mindful of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of implementation of this legislation.  When will the regulations be put in place?  On occasions there have been delays of ten to 15 years, following the enactment of legislation, before regulations were put in place.  This matter should be addressed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When spending money on roads in the past we did not always provide for what is known as the hard shoulder.  This issue is being addressed on the Galway-Dublin road.  If hard shoulders are not provided there is no place for trucks or slow moving traffic to pull in and allow other traffic overtake.  When a road with a hard shoulder is followed by a road with no hard shoulder this can lead to frustration on the part of drivers and accidents may occur.  We all have to learn to be patient and not to do anything stupid or silly when driving.  I welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister for introducing it, as it allows us to accede to the European agreement and bring Irish law into line with EU Directives.  Once we pass the legislation I hope the regulations will be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, for introducing this Bill, which deals with raising standards in all matters concerning the transport of dangerous goods on Irish roads and internationally by Irish carriers. Its main aim is to put in place enabling powers for the making of regulations which will, first, allow Ireland to accede to the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road, known as the ADR; second, introduce into Irish law the Directive 94/55 EC on the approximation of laws of member states with regard to the transportation of dangerous goods by road; and third, bring into Irish law the Directive 94/50 EC on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road.  All three of those outcomes are welcome.</P>
      <P>The European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road was drawn up in Geneva in 1957 &mdash; I may be considered a mature, middle aged person but I had not yet been born.  The ADR came into force in 1968 and has 33 signatories but it is regrettable Ireland is the only EU member state which was not a contracting party until now.  Ministers dealing with these matters should consider introducing a mechanism for reviewing EU directives after they have passed their sell-by date, rather than allowing for compliance at a late stage. There has been great change since 1968, let alone since 1957, and one wonders about the implications of a member state signing up to an agreement this late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take another example with which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would be familiar, I was <Col N="64" /> shocked to discover the executive of the Tallaght hospital met the Minister for Health and Children to discuss an extension to the accident and emergency unit of the hospital after it was built but before it opened.  Consultants &mdash; I will not name them but we know who they are &mdash; reported on the need for additional accident and emergency services and hospitals for the greater Dublin area and the hospital was built, but before its doors were opened it required a special allocation of additional moneys to change its infrastructure.  In that case, there was only a ten year gap between drawing up the plans and the discovery of extra need.  In the case of this Bill, it is more than 40 years since the agreement, which must necessarily cause its own complications and difficulties.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains two detailed technical annexes which clearly set out the circumstances under which dangerous goods may be transported by road across international frontiers.  It is an international agreement which deals with transnational transportation of dangerous goods.  In practice, Irish hauliers who transport dangerous goods internationally currently comply with the detailed provisions of the ADR and the Irish Road Hauliers' Association welcomes the measures, late as they may be.</P>
    <P>In light of the recent tragic accident in Arklow, one provision which stands out as being merited and welcome is section 9, which allows for the arrest without warrant of hauliers from other states for certain offences in cases where a summons may not be satisfactory to assure appearance. Section 18 also deals with hauliers from other states and this is welcome because it is the first time we have covered them in legislation. Section 18(2)(b) provides for a fine of £150 &mdash; that should be increased to about £1,000.  When one considers the implications of the offence and the process involved, £150 is not an acceptable sum.  The Minister may be tied to this figure by EU legislation or provisions in other member states, but if not perhaps we should show leadership and provide for a greater fine.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes compliance easier by supplying the necessary type approval and vehicle certification facilities in Ireland.  It is time we acceded to the agreement because it will put Irish haulage concerns on an equal footing with hauliers from other contracting states, and in that regard the Bill is welcome.</P>
    <P>The second aim of the Bill is to introduce to Irish law Directive 94/55 EC, adopted on 21 November 1994, which has the objective of applying the detailed provisions of the ADR to domestic transport within each member state.  As a result, the high standards laid down in the ADR concerning the international transport of dangerous goods shall also apply to internal movements within each country.  This is welcome and should lead to a higher overall standard.  I will refer later to my concerns about the transportation of dangerous goods, which I have raised previously in this House.</P>
    <P>As the directive applies to the domestic transport <Col N="65" /> conditions of 15 countries, from the Mediterranean to the Baltic, there are a number of derogations from the annexes to enable member states take account of different domestic circumstances in each state.  One must appreciate such differences but states may use this opt-out clause to request a derogation when they would be able to comply with the agreement and it would be in their best interests to do so.  I ask the Minister to vigorously tackle this with our EU counterparts &mdash; as he does on most issues &mdash; to ensure the derogation is not used in this way.  Ireland has availed of a number of these derogations and I hope that is to take account of our circumstances rather than to avoid difficulties which might arise if we did not have such derogations.</P>
    <P>The third element of the process relates to European Directive 95/50 EC which provides for uniform checking procedures for transport of dangerous goods by road.  This directive also provides that a representative proportion of such transport movement be checked annually.  That is welcome, but it might be argued that annually is not sufficient and that it should be done more regularly.</P>
    <P>With the making of the regulations pursuant to section 17 of the Bill, we have a detailed and comprehensive set of rules and regulations concerning the carriage of dangerous goods internationally and domestically, and the enforcement of those rules.  A number of important features in the Bill deal specifically with enforcement.  Perhaps we should ensure there are regular checks in that regard and take the opportunity to consider what enforcements there have been to date with regard to the current regulations.  I would also like to know what the current rules and regulations are, not just in relation to the carriage of dangerous goods but in relation to the haulage industry as a whole, and the level of enforcement. I would like to be advised also of the success of such enforcement, particularly in relation to the speed of heavy goods vehicles.  I understand there are regulations in place.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know what checks took place in the first nine months of this year, and what Garda statistics are available.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the prohibition of a vehicle or other transport equipment if, in the opinion of an inspector or garda, that vehicle constitutes a danger to the public if used for the carriage of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the arrest of a driver who is in contravention of the Bill or the regulations where the driver cannot give a satisfactory address for the service of a summons, and on arrest the driver will be brought to the nearest Garda station and released on station bail if there is no sitting of the District Court at the time.  If the driver is from another jurisdiction and subsequently fails to appear in court at the relevant time, he may forfeit the bail.  I welcome the fact that sections 9 and 18 are included in the Bill but we should seek to address the £150 fine.  I appreciate the Minister's position in regard to the <Col N="66" /> sections I have just referred to, but if the Garda Síochána are to be the policing mechanism, I would like to know how they have policed in recent months and their success in the area I mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also to deal with some of the minor offences by way of on-the-spot fines which must be paid without delay.  This will have the effect of bringing to book any out-of-State driver who offends.  These elements of the Bill represent a genuine attempt to deal with the problem of hauliers from other jurisdictions who might be tempted to flout the law and take advantage of the fact that they cannot, in the normal course of events, be served with a summons.  The Minister has made a genuine attempt to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, referred to the road infrastructure.  In the early days of my participation at city council meetings I was concerned about the number of deaths in the city of people waiting for bus services.  These accidents happened because there was no difference between the road surface at bus stops and the rest of the road, and leaking oil from the buses made the road slippy with the result that there were some grave accidents.  I am pleased Dublin Corporation is currently addressing that with a special anti-skid surface, particularly at bus stops.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to our road structure.  I appreciate we have inherited a structure and that we are attempting to put a better structure in place, but we should look at the feasibility of using rail transport, on lines that are currently in use or lines that were in use in years gone by that are currently lying idle, particularly for the carriage of dangerous goods.  I have a particular concern about the Dublin-Ballina train on which dangerous and explosive substances are carried through a very densely populated area of Dublin city.  I support the view that we should encourage the use of rail.  Equally we should closely monitor how we can achieve the transportation of dangerous goods in the interests of the wider public and keep the rail transport links out of heavily populated areas, particularly when carrying dangerous and explosive substances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will make one comprehensive set of regulations which will combine with the annexes of the ADR and the Directive 95/55 which will be applicable to both manufacturing and transport operators and will be a comprehensive set of rules relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>In speaking about the carriage of dangerous goods, I have to put on record my concern, which is well known, about the transportation of nuclear waste materials and the activities of British Nuclear Fuels, particularly on the British west coast which is so close to our own east coast, and the carriage, handling and storage of such waste. I am deeply concerned about it.  I do not have confidence in British Nuclear Fuels' handling of serious accidents which seem to be covered up for <Col N="67" /> a period of time before British Nuclear Fuels gives any information.</P>
    <P>I am on public record as expressing my concern about the road infrastructure in the city of Dublin and, currently, the new design and layout of the Malahide Road and Fairview.  When the regulations on the carriage of dangerous goods are in place, will they provide for the width of road which should apply for vehicles carrying such goods?  Despite expenditure of £1.7 million on the Malahide road, one stretch of it is less than 11 feet in width.  A quality bus corridor which will be used by vehicles carrying up to 50 passengers will run alongside it, leaving little or no room for cyclists.  Soon after one leaves that stretch of road one encounters what I consider a computer zigzag directing cars to move from one lane to the other.</P>
    <P>Like thousands of people living on the northside, I am frustrated at the people who drafted the new design and layout for the Malahide road. They have compounded the difficulties for commuters at peak traffic times.  What they have done might appear to be suitable on a computer, but it is impractical and unsafe in practice.  That is particularly important when considering legislation such as this, which seeks to provide for the safe carriage of dangerous goods.  While this legislation is being considered another statutory authority is providing road of only 11 feet in width for use by such vehicles.</P>
    <P>The legislation is welcome.  It will finally enable Ireland to accede to the ADR and bring two important EU directives into Irish law.  We must insist on the highest possible standards in the carriage of dangerous goods.  We must also ensure the rules are properly enforced without discrimination. The framework we are putting place paves the way for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their thoughtful, constructive and useful contributions. The technicalities associated with the European agreement on the international carriage of dangerous goods by road, the ADR, and the two associated European Union directives are complex and difficult.  For that reason, I am even more appreciative of the helpful contributions of my colleagues in the House.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the welcome for the Bill. However, I wish to respond to a number of points made by Deputies during the debate.  Deputy Yates was critical of the delay in bringing forward the Road Transport Bill.  However, he failed to explain that the Bill was hurriedly introduced by the Government of which he was a member and that it was deficient in a number of ways.  In particular, it failed to tackle the problems posed by out of State hauliers.  I have been working on this issue with the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the haulage industry and it will be addressed in the Road Transport Bill which I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> The difficulties which have been experienced in the past with out of State hauliers are being addressed in the legislation before the House.  I agree with Deputies who emphasised the need for consignor liability in the case of overweight haulage. This will be dealt with in the forthcoming Road Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates, who was in a critical mood, was somewhat derogatory of the road haulage review which is in the course of preparation.  The criticisms levelled by the Deputy are unacceptable.  I am extremely proud of that initiative and much work has been done on it by the officials in my Department.  It is an important initiative.  It is the first major review of the structure of the Irish road haulage sector and it is particularly timely in the context of liberalisation of the sector in Europe.  The review is necessary to establish a firm basis on which to make decisions in this sector.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about section 9 of the Bill which provides for the arrest of a driver if an offence has been committed.  Members were concerned about who should set bail and what amount the bail should be.  Currently there is no provision for arresting a driver unless he or she is alleged to be guilty of dangerous driving.  Section 9 confers that power in relation to offences under the Bill where the driver is unable to give a satisfactory address for the service of summonses.</P>
    <P>Bail is set by either the district court judge or the station sergeant if a suitable sitting of the District Court is not taking place.  Setting of bail by the station sergeant is in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It will be a matter for the sergeant to set the amount of bail having regard to the alleged offence or offences.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies believe the level of fines is not sufficient to deter offenders in an area of transport which has potential for extremely dangerous accidents.  There are three categories of fines.  Under section 11 a person is liable to a fine of £100,000 on conviction on indictment.  A person is liable to a fine of £1,500 on summary conviction.  Provision has also been made for on-the-spot fines of £150.</P>
    <P>The concern raised by colleagues related to the level of on-the-spot fines.  These fines will be levied only for minor specified offences.  These could include breaches of marking and plating requirements, non-provision of required equipment and deficiencies in documentation.  The amount must be paid without delay and the inspector will have discretion as to whether to treat the case as an on-the-spot fine offence.  In the context of a £50 on-the-spot fine for speeding or the £15 fine which obtains for a parking offence, the £150 fine is adequate for the type of offence which is envisaged. There is provision for the amount to be increased if it is found to be inadequate in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked if the Bill could be self-financing.  Income will be generated through a number of enforcement activities and that income will accrue to the Health and Safety <Col N="69" /> Authority.  Income will also be generated by approval of training providers, approval of training courses, driver examinations and the issuing of driver training certificates.  Inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority currently carry out much of this work and are paid in respect of those duties.</P>
    <P>On the passing of the regulations, all the revenue from this source will go to the HSA to cover enforcement activities.  It is estimated that at current fee levels, £88,000 per annum would be generated for the HSA.  The Government has sanctioned the recruitment of four additional inspectors for the HSA for the enforcement of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Broughan, Haughey, Callely and others raised the question of derogations negotiated by Ireland.  First, it must be stressed that derogations apply only to domestic transport and not international journeys.  Second, derogations were sought so as to ensure that as far as possible the economic impact on the sector would not be excessive.  A number of these derogations were introduced for good and practical reasons.  For instance, the derogation relating to ammonium nitrate fertiliser in bags means that farms do not have to take on board all the ADR requirements. The derogation relating to dispensing gases carried on the same vehicle refers to small amounts. It makes sense to distribute the necessary dispensing gases to pubs in cans.</P>
    <P>Low level radioactive material for hospitals is another example where very small amounts are involved.  Through the distribution licence the distributor is approved by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland or RPII.  There are other examples.</P>
    <P>Under Article 64 of Directive 94/55, existing tankers circulating in Ireland are allowed to be used to the end of their commercial life, provided they are maintained in accordance with the national provisions applicable on 31 December 1996.  Irish requirements on that date were set out in Statutory Instruments 386 and 389 of 1996. These require tanks to be examined at the interval specified in ADr. For example, with regard to petroleum tanks, a leak proofness test is required every three years and a thorough examination every six years.  The periods could be different for other substances.  Tanks can continue to be manufactured in accordance with existing pre-January 1997 standards, until 1 January 1999.  That is now being extended to 1 July 2001.  After that date it is expected that CEN standards for tanks will be included in ABR. These will be applicable to new tanks from that particular date.  The position, therefore, is that existing tankers can continue quite safely in the domestic market, provided they undergo and satisfy the necessary checks.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about the transport of dangerous goods by rail. The transport of dangerous goods by rail is covered by a separate convention entitled RID. <Col N="70" /> This convention is fully operated by Iarnród Éireann in the matter of rail transport.</P>
    <P>There are individual codes for the transport of dangerous goods by sea and by plane.  The rules for transport by sea are covered by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code, IMDG.  The ICAO technical instructions apply to air transport.  Dangerous goods packaged and labelled for transportation by sea and air are accepted for any road leg in accordance with the ADR.</P>
    <P>A number of colleagues raised the matter of training drivers and all saw this as a necessity.  I fully agree with that.  As I mentioned in my introductory comments, in excess of 5,000 Irish drivers have training certificates.  It might be helpful if I detailed the situation as it stands at present. Driver training is carried out to full ADR requirements.  Training is provided by professional trainers who are approved by the Health and Safety Authority, as are the training courses they provide.  Each driver is required to undergo a basic training course of three days.  Drivers of tankers, vehicles carrying explosives and vehicles which carry ADR quantities of radioactive materials require a further two days' specialisation course.  Following training, the driver is obliged to sit an examination and, if successful, is issued with a certificate which lasts for five years. Between years four and five he is required to attend a refresher course and sit a refresher examination.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing commitment on the part of the Government to ensure that drivers are trained to the highest standards.  They are required to retrain every five years.  I am of the view that this system is excellent and has raised standards of professionalism significantly in Ireland in the area of dangerous goods transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn raised questions about the enforcement staff who will be charged with enforcing the rules.  She was also concerned about who will carry out type approval and vehicle testing, and whether they will be trained.  First, we must enact the Bill in order that the competent authorities can be appointed.  Only then can the various elements be put in place.  As I mentioned previously, the bulk of enforcement will fall to inspectors of the HSA.  These inspectors are fully qualified and properly trained for the task.  They maintain the highest professional standards.</P>
    <P>In the transport of explosives, enforcement duties will rest with the Government inspector of explosives who has long experience in this field. Inspectors from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will be appointed inspectors under this Bill for radioactive substances.</P>
    <P>The type approval of tanks and other equipment will come within the ambit of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Vehicle testing will be conducted by trained mechanical staff at test stations, to be approved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Tank inspections will be carried out by insurance surveyors attached to Irish insurance companies <Col N="71" /> for ADR type tanks, and by competent persons for the existing tanks.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Cooper-Flynn need have no concerns about the abilities and competencies of those who will be appointed to perform these various tasks.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the Government has shown its commitment to adequate enforcement by approving the recruitment of four additional inspectors to the HSA for this task.  Much work has been done on drafting the regulations under the interdepartmental committee established for that purpose.  Arrangements are in hand to organise vehicle testing and type approval authorities. A target date for making these regulations has been set for the New Year.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concerns about oil spillages.  This issue has been looked at and there is no evidence that the reported oil spillages are from petroleum tankers.  A testing regime for these tankers was put in place in 1996 to ensure that tankers are properly maintained. One of the tests is a leak proofness test, which will immediately identify a leak.  These tests are being carried out by competent persons and inspectors from the HSA.  They are carrying out road checks to ensure that tank tests have been done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan mentioned irregularities in the Border area with regard to tankers being used for purposes for which they were not designed.  I always have great respect for local knowledge and what Deputy Boylan said will be noted.  It is deserving of some vigilance.  It is known that some of the reported leaks have come from the fuel tanks of vehicles which have been overfilled or are leaking or whose fuel caps have not been properly replaced or are missing.  One small drop of oil on a wet surface can give the impression of a more serious problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked about emergencies and the role of local authorities.  Major emergencies involving dangerous goods in transit are planned for in the national peace time emergency plan.  A major emergency is defined as an event which usually, with little or no warning, causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property beyond the normal capabilities of the emergency services. Examples are fire, explosive gas releases, transportation accidents, spillage of dangerous substances, etc.</P>
    <P>Each emergency service is obliged to prepare plans governing its response to any major emergency. The plans must conform with the broad guidelines laid down in the framework for co-ordinated responses to a major emergency.  This framework sets out the responsibilities of each service in an emergency and requires that plans be co-ordinated between the services.  A co-ordinating group of senior representatives from each service meets at least once a year to review the co-ordination arrangements.  The emergency services involved are the Irish Marine Emergency <Col N="72" /> Service, local authorities, including the fire services, health boards and the Garda.</P>
    <P>Exercises to test plans are undertaken frequently and the Departments involved normally have officers in attendance to act as observers and to advise on the lessons learned from the exercise when reviewing the plans.  The first port of call in an accident involving the transport of dangerous goods is the fire services who are fully trained to deal with such incidents.  The gardaí will also be involved in making the area safe and other emergency services will be called in if required.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their useful contributions and I hope I was able to respond to the concerns raised.  When this Bill is passed, we will be able to put in place the three blocks necessary to ensure a safe environment surrounding the carriage of dangerous goods by road &mdash; statutory provisions, training and enforcement.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the VHI to act as an agent for an authorised insurer in the sale of an international health care plan.  This legislation is being introduced on foot of representations received from the VHI board and entails a limited amendment of the VHI Acts to give the board a specific additional power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More fundamental considerations relating to the corporate status of the VHI must be <Col N="73" /> addressed.  I know Members will be keen to hear about these as soon as possible and to have an opportunity to debate the matter.  I assure the House that the broader issue of the appropriate corporate status of the VHI going forward is being actively and comprehensively addressed in the context of my Department's preparations relating to the proposed White Paper on private health insurance.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that pending completion of consideration of the more fundamental issues, I must respond to the board's expressed needs as regards legislation for the effective conduct of its business in the immediate term.  I inform the House that in the developing competitive health insurance market, the board considers it imperative that the proposed amendment be enacted as quickly as possible to enable the VHI to compete more effectively.  The legislation will lead to easy availability and continuity of cover for VHI members who intend to live outside the jurisdiction for temporary periods.  It is geared towards helping the VHI to better serve the needs of the modern consumer.</P>
    <P>The VHI was established in 1957 as a not for profit body to provide cover primarily for the 15 per cent of the population who did not have an entitlement to public hospital services.  Deputies will be aware and I am sure will appreciate the success the VHI board has made of fulfilling its role within the health care system.  In the early days this role was primarily as a provider of cover for those who did not have an entitlement to hospital services and, as time passed, as a provider of health insurance to all those who wished to avail of private health insurance, irrespective of their eligibility for health services.</P>
    <P>Its role and importance in our health care system has expanded considerably since its foundation. The environment in which it operates has become more demanding and sophisticated over the years, particularly as regards the expectations of its members in terms of quality of product and service.</P>
    <P>Today, membership of the VHI is at an all time high of 1.45 million people, which represents 40 per cent of our population.  It has more than 1,000 members joining every week and operates 6,700 group schemes throughout the country.  The evolving competitive market has elicited an enthusiastic and vigorous response from the board, management and staff of the VHI.  Membership continues to grow and, where it previously had five main plans on offer, it now offers the consumer the choice of ten plans following the introduction of its new options plans at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>As a not for profit organisation, the VHI aims to return to its members the greatest possible proportion of its income, while maintaining a sufficient reserve.  I note that in the five years to the end of February 1998, the total premium income of the VHI was £1.287 billion and the total claims expenditure was £1.274 billion.  This represents a payout of 99 per cent of subscription income on <Col N="74" /> members' claims during the period concerned. For the financial year ended February 1998, the VHI's premium income amounted to £304 million, while £294 million was returned to members in the payment of benefits arising from claims incurred.  Reserves now stand at £76 million and I am aware of the board's commitment to strengthen them further.</P>
    <P>In common with other sectors, the health insurance market was opened to competition pursuant to EU directives.  Prior to the introduction of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, the VHI operated as a statutory monopoly.  That Act and the associated regulations provided a framework for a competitive private health insurance market, while maintaining the principles of private health insurance in Ireland &mdash; open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to have an insurer of the vast experience of the British United Provident Association, known as BUPA, providing competition to the VHI and offering choice to the consumer. I hope other players will enter and further enhance the competitive environment.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the benefit which competition brings in terms of invigorating the consumer focus of the existing market player, apart from the new and different approaches which additional competitors may bring to attract and retain the consumer.  This is particularly the case in our community rated health insurance market where insurers must rely on quality, service and efficiency, rather than ability in the practice of preferred risk selection or cherry-picking in order to define themselves as a market leader.</P>
    <P>The broader environment has also undergone dramatic change since the VHI was founded.  As an open economy, Ireland has embraced global change, international trade and foreign investment. Central to this process is the ability of people to move from Ireland to other countries in a free manner.  In the modern economic global village an increasing number of people employed by export companies, multinational companies and State agencies will live abroad for significant periods during their working lives.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Hospital Waiting Lists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the scandalous increase in the hospital waiting lists, which on 30 June 1998 stood at 34,331 an increase of over 13 per cent since this Government took office, and the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to implement the broad range of reforms necessary to end the waiting lists crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I propose to share time with Deputies McGinley, Perry, Stanton, Deenihan, Naughten and Crawford.</P>
    <P>Our health services must be patient centred and must put patients first.  Inadequacies in the public hospital service are depriving those who need it of access within a reasonable timeframe to the medical services to which they are entitled. Those in the front line of healthcare provision, namely, doctors and nurses, are also required to work under unacceptable and intolerable pressures. During the lifetime of the current Government and the term in office of the Minister for Health and Children, hospital waiting lists have escalated dramatically and the length of time patients are forced to wait before gaining access to essential treatment or surgery has lengthened unacceptably.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats entered Government promising waiting list reductions.  Fianna Fáil promised dramatic waiting list reductions in its election manifesto in June 1997.  Instead, the two Government parties have shown contempt for GMS patients and failed to harness the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy to provide, for everyone who requires it, speedy access to medical treatment and surgery.</P>
    <P>A democratic state that guarantees people the right of access to a lawyer if they commit a crime should also guarantee their right of access to a physician and essential in-patient hospital treatment or surgery if they take ill.  It is an indictment of the Minister that the number of patients awaiting admission to hospital for treatment and elective surgery is steadily increasing.</P>
    <P>As of today we have access to only the published information concerning in-patient waiting lists as it stood at the end of June 1998.  At the end of June 1997 there were 30,453 people on the in-patient hospital waiting list.  By the end of June 1998 the number had risen to 34,331 patients. These figures included 7,638 people awaiting ear, nose and throat surgery or procedures, 6,648 people awaiting orthopaedic surgery, 3,608 people awaiting ophthalmology services, 2,545 women awaiting gynaecological procedures, 2,762 people awaiting vascular treatment, 1,430 patients awaiting urological procedures, 1,211 awaiting cardiac surgery and 1,243 awaiting cardiological procedures.  During the summer 1,477 hospital beds were closed for varying periods.</P>
    <P>In the context of these closures and further autumn cutbacks being implemented by hospitals throughout the country which are attempting to remain within their financial budgets, it is reasonable to estimate that the number of people currently on hospital in-patient waiting lists is in the region of 36,500.  However, the real figure will not be known for at least another two months.  Waiting lists increased by 13 per cent in the first 12 months of the Minister's term of office.  As of today, it is reasonable to estimate that they have increased by 18 per cent.  It is not merely the number of people on in-patient hospital waiting lists <Col N="76" /> which is of particular concern, it is the length of time adults and children must wait for essential treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children publicly stated that he has an objective to ensure that where an adult requires surgery it will be undertaken within 12 months and that where a child requires surgery it will be undertaken within six months.  The Minister has failed to achieve this objective.  At the end of June 1998, 827 adults had been awaiting cardiac surgery for in excess of 12 months.  Some of these people have been awaiting surgery for almost two years or longer.  At the end of June 1998, 47 children had been awaiting cardiac surgery for in excess of six months.  It was recently reported &mdash; the Minister may or may not confirm the accuracy of the report &mdash; that there are now 56 children who have been on cardiac surgery waiting lists for in excess of 18 months.</P>
    <P>While I accept the waiting list initiative targeted cardiac surgery this year and as a consequence, in fairness to the Minister, it must be acknowledged the overall cardiac surgery waiting list has been reduced, the initiative nevertheless fell abysmally short of what was required to meet the essential objective articulated by the Minister. In other areas, the Minister's waiting list initiative had virtually no impact.  For example, on 30 June 1998, for in excess of 12 months 650 adult patients had been awaiting cataract surgery, 435 adult patients had been awaiting hip replacement operations and 2,216 had been awaiting ear, nose and throat procedures.  As of 30 June 1998, for over six months 1,456 children had been awaiting tonsil and adenoid surgery, 194 had been awaiting grommet surgery and 136 awaiting various ophthalmology procedures.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented economic prosperity it is unacceptable that so many public patients must wait so long to be admitted to hospital.  It is indefensible that life-enhancing, pain-relieving operations such as hip replacements should be out of reach for months &mdash; in some cases even years &mdash; for elderly and infirm people.  It is unacceptable and unjust that children's school attendance is disrupted by ongoing bouts of debilitating infection while the ear, nose and throat surgery waiting lists grow longer by the month.  It is also unacceptable that school-going children with hearing difficulties have their education seriously impaired.  It is shocking that in this day and age cardiac patients die while on the cardiac surgery waiting list.  It is scandalous that in a reply to a recent Dáil question the Minister for Health and Children admitted that neither he nor his Department had readily available information regarding the number of patients who have died while awaiting cardiac surgery.  This is something I would expect to be of central concern to a Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Is this information &ldquo;not readily available to the Minister&rdquo;&mdash; to use the phrase which appeared in the reply to which I referred &mdash; because he does not want to know the reality of the tragedies <Col N="77" /> which confront families reliant on access to public hospital healthcare or is it not readily available because he does not wish to be held responsible for such deaths and is more concerned with his Department's possible legal liability than with the plight of patients.  Astonishingly, this is not the only information stated by the Minister in reply to a succession of Dáil questions to be &ldquo;not routinely collected&rdquo; or &ldquo;not readily available to his Department&rdquo;.  For 12 months the Minister has been unable to supply me with full details of all requests from hospitals throughout the State for additional financial allocations to either modernise their facilities or provide additional services.  I am now seeking this information under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>Last week, in reply to a Dáil question, the Minister informed me that information is not &ldquo;readily available&rdquo; to detail existing requests from hospitals throughout the State for the appointment of additional consultants and the nature of the specialities concerned.  Nor was information readily available regarding the number of current vacant hospital consultant posts throughout the country or the relevant hospital and health board areas to which these vacancies relate.  In addition, the Minister could not inform me of the posts currently vacant due to delays in his Department providing the required financial sanction.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is considerable concern on the Fianna Fáil back benches about the scandalous state of the public hospital in-patient waiting lists. As recently as last Thursday, Deputy Callely asked the Minister &ldquo;if his attention has been drawn to the cancellation of appointments and ward closure in hospitals, reported to be due to inadequate budget allocation to meet the demand, with particular reference to the Mater and Beaumont hospitals&rdquo;.  The number of temporary bed closures in Beaumont Hospital to date this year is 191, while the number for the Mater Hospital is 60 for a period of 12 weeks.  I understand a similar number of beds in the Mater Hospital will remain closed for the last quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Deputy Callely was stirred by the plight of his constituents who are regularly being informed that surgery fixed for particular dates, many months in advance, is being cancelled. It is not unreasonable to assume that Deputy Callely, prior to tabling his parliamentary question, had discussed his worries with the Minister for Health and Children and this question was the last throw of a desperate man concerned about his electoral prospects at the next election. What did the Minister say to him to set his mind at ease?  Did he get the assurances he was seeking? Did the Minister respond to his clarion call of concern?  The reply he received from his Fianna Fáil ministerial colleague was that his Department does not collect information on numbers of postponed elective procedures or appointments.  The Deputy was told that temporary bed closures form a part of the normal bed <Col N="78" /> management function performed by local hospital management with an overall budgetary management strategy.  All he got essentially was a piece of political gobbledegook which, when translated, was basically an acknowledgement by the Minister that he had failed to provide to either hospital the funding each required for 1998 and that as a consequence they each had to close down beds and elective surgery had to be cancelled. Implicitly, the Minister was telling his colleague that while he remained Minister for Health and Children the same would happen in 1999.  I wonder did Deputy Callely circulate the Minister's reply to his parliamentary question around his constituency with his usual enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Hospital bed closures are a false economy. Waiting list reductions effected by waiting list initiatives are ultimately off-set by bed closures which result in the cancellation of elective surgery. So far I have been addressing the problem of in-patient hospital waiting lists, the only waiting list published.  There are two waiting lists, one visible and one hidden.  The visible waiting list is that of the 36,500 public patients who are today waiting to be admitted to hospital for surgery or treatment.  The second hidden list is made up of those thousands of people who have been referred by their GP to a consultant, who are awaiting for many months &mdash; some for more than a year &mdash; to see the consultant to whom they have been referred.  They are essentially a queue to potentially join another queue, the in-patient hospital waiting list queue.  Again astonishingly, the Minister for Health and Children collates no information and is unable to estimate the numbers of patients on this hidden queue to join a queue, nor the length of time within any area of speciality during which people must wait to see a consultant.</P>
    <P>The delays experienced by public patients create unnecessary anxiety not only for people whose medical condition may already be a cause of concern, but place extra strain on close family members.  These delays are also directly impacting on the quality of life of patients and their families, and in the context of particular illnesses place patients' lives at risk.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the individual waiting list initiatives of the Minister and his predecessors have solved the individual health problems of many thousands of people.  However, waiting list initiatives have not and cannot structurally solve the waiting list problem.  Nevertheless it is clear that a further substantial sum must be allocated as a waiting list initiative by the Government in its forthcoming budget to tackle today's chronic waiting list crisis.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed to read of the recent speech to the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association by the Minister for Health and Children in dealing with this aspect of the waiting list issue.  It seems that when speaking in public about this problem the Minister is incapable of accepting that it is his responsibility and the responsibility of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> Government of which he is a member to address and resolve it.  He is reported in one of the medical journals over the past two weeks as stating that he will seek £20 million for a waiting list initiative for 1999 from the Minister for Finance. His presentation of this resembled that of a supplicant collecting crumbs at the table of an uncooperative and unsympathetic finance Minister. His comments suggested that he was not optimistic he would get the sum he was seeking so that in the event of this amount being allocated to him he can present himself in heroic guise.  The Minister should know the audience he is addressing in this manner is not impressed.  The Minister is part of the Government and not apart from it. Instead of this public playacting, he should ensure in discussions with his Fianna Fáil colleague in the Department of Finance that the funds required to tackle the waiting list crisis are allocated and he should in the last quarter of this financial year now urgently seek an additional allocation of funds to prevent the inevitable bed closures in October, November and December.</P>
    <P>Apart from funding an allocation for waiting list initiatives, a great deal more is necessary.  To tackle the waiting list crisis, a broad range of reforms are required which impact on departmental, health board and Comhairle na n-Ospidéal procedures, on hospital structures, the management of waiting lists and the manner in which GPs and consultants work, as well as medical staffing.  The co-ordinated nationwide use of the latest interactive communications as a diagnostic tool and for the administration and monitoring of the health service is also crucial to ensuring a caring health service responsive to the community's needs and equipped to meet the challenges of a new millennium.  At a time of unprecedented economic growth and Exchequer income, funds should be targeted to put in place a comprehensive programme of measures which once and for all addresses the waiting list problem.</P>
    <P>Experience has taught that <i>ad hoc</i> piecemeal initiatives merely act as a palliative.  What we need is a cure.  Fine Gael proposes a number of specific actions designed to tackle the in-patient and out-patient waiting list crisis in a systematic and practical way, and to make the acute hospital services more patient centred.  First, we propose that national guidelines be put in place detailing specific timeframes within which a patient should attend with a consultant for an opinion and within which treatments would be provided or surgery undertaken.  Financial allocations to the health service and the appointment of medical personnel should be designed to facilitate compliance with these guidelines nationally and to set a standard for the provision of medical services.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a radical overhaul of the approach taken by the Department of Health and Children to monitor the provision of medical services.  New information systems and technology are required by the Department to link into existing hospital and health board computer <Col N="80" /> systems to enable the Department to have available to it up to date statistics and information so that it can fully monitor and analyse the manner in which the medical service is functioning within each health board area and within each hospital within each health board area.  At present only quarterly figures are published for in-patient hospital waiting lists.  There can be anything between four and six months delay for information contained in such figures to become available. The Department, as we have already seen, does not maintain up to date statistical information in a variety of other areas.  These issues must be addressed by a proper monitoring system which gives on-line up to date daily information on the workings of the health system.</P>
    <P>Where consultation posts are vacant or new consultant posts have been approved appointments should be made without delay.  In the event of retirement, death or incapacity of a consultant in an approved post, hospitals and health boards must be given the authority to immediately set in train the necessary recruitment procedures and to make the required permanent appointment without recourse to the Department of Health and Children.  There is also a need to ensure that health boards and hospitals fill temporary posts which are required without delay.  At present unnecessary delays frequently occur in filling positions.  These delays are exacerbating the waiting list problem.</P>
    <P>There is a need to appoint additional consultants and this need is apparent throughout the health service.  The growth in the waiting lists is a direct consequence of the failure of the Minister to sanction the appointment of the additional consultants required.  Provision also should be made for a new grade structure in the health service to allow for the appointment of specialists, a grade above that of senior registrar but below that of consultant.  Doctors recruited as specialists would have to have qualifications approved as appropriate for identified specialities by the postgraduate medical colleges.  Specialist posts would be for a fixed term of three, four or five years and an educational and career structure should be put in place to provide for the possibility of specialists ultimately becoming consultants.  The creation of such a new grade would have to be tailored to meet the needs of the health service.  Clearly the most pressing need is for additional medical and surgical capacity to assist consultants to reduce and maintain a reduction in the public patient waiting lists.  Specialists would have the skill to take consultations or perform specified procedures or routine surgery with the agreement of the consultant.  The appointment of specialists would reduce pressures on consultants and the unnecessary delays experienced by patients.</P>
    <P>Procedures should also be agreed to facilitate consultants who specialise in a particular branch of medicine in a particular hospital or health board area to join their colleagues and collaborate in operating joint waiting lists.  Those who have long waiting lists should share some of their <Col N="81" /> work with colleagues who have shorter lists.  To maintain patient choice and in recognition of patients' wishes, those who wish to wait for a surgeon or specialist would be free to do so.</P>
    <P>Where appropriate in hospitals to which there is attached two or more consultants who have the same speciality, consultant teams should be formed whose workload can be regulated by a clinical director within the speciality to ensure efficiency in dealing with waiting lists, in-patient admissions and discharges.  The clinical director within such a team would fill this position for a period of two or three years and it would pass by rotation to other members.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country, hospitals are suffering nursing shortages.  Without further delay the Minister should urgently implement the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing and he should in doing so recognise that nurses, who have specialist qualifications, are entitled to additional income to reflect the nature of their qualifications.</P>
    <P>We also call for a national assessment of unused capacity within each of our hospitals. Hospitals which operate efficiently and have no significant waiting list in a particular specialty or which have unused capacity should have the option to buy in work from outside their area. This does not happen at present.</P>
    <P>The necessary legal provisions and financial and administrative mechanisms should also be put in place to facilitate cross-Border co-operation between health boards and hospitals.  There is no reason cross-Border consultancy posts could not be created to ensure that the broadest range of specialist care is available to those who live adjacent to the Border in this State or in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of additional proposals by the Fine Gael Party which are now published in the document entitled &ldquo;Patient First&rdquo; and which we believe, if implemented, would dramatically impact on waiting lists, not on a temporary basis, but would provide the structural basis for tackling our waiting list problem and once and for all addressing it in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take the necessary action to tackle the problem, not just by waiting list initiatives but by implementing the necessary structural reforms in our health service.  I anticipate from leaks that have occurred that some of the reforms the Fine Gael Party is proposing may be included in the report of the review group on waiting lists submitted to the Minister's desk. Strangely this report has sat on his desk since last August, yet he is extraordinarily reluctant to publish it in full.  I call on him to do so because we will then know what is recommended by the group appointed by him.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to implement the various recommendations contained in the Fine Gael document published last week entitled &ldquo;Patient First&rdquo;.  He has sought to deflect attention from the real extent of the waiting list problem.  It is our hope that as a result of this debate he will be <Col N="82" /> finally forced to take action that should have been taken a long time ago.</P>

      <P>A good indication of a Government's level of concern for its people is the manner in which it treats the sick and infirm and the level of care it provides for them.  Applying these guidelines the Government is well down the league and the slippage continues.  We now know from the Minister's figures that the waiting lists for hospitals have increased by 13 per cent nationally between June 1997 and June 1998.  This deterioration occurred at a time of unprecedented economic development and when Exchequer returns are better than forecast by even the most optimistic economic commentators. Exchequer surpluses are no longer estimated in millions but in billions of pounds.  This is a good country for the healthy, but is hell on earth for the sick and infirm.</P>
      <P>While the situation nationally is serious it is disastrous in the north west and County Donegal. During the period from June 1997 to June 1998 the hospital waiting lists in Letterkenny General Hospital and Sligo Regional Hospital, the two main hospitals in the north west, have grown not by 13 per cent but by 30 per cent, an astronomical increase in a one year period.  In Letterkenny General Hospital the waiting list for serious surgical procedures now stands at 632 while in Sligo Regional Hospital it is 1,544 making a total of 2,176.  Over a year ago, when the Minister took office, it stood at 1,644.  This represents an increase of 532 or 30 per cent.  What a record. This is an intolerable situation and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>These figures do not include the many hundreds who have been referred to consultants by GPs, to what my colleague, Deputy Shatter, has referred to as the queue to join a queue.  In addition, there are many more hundreds from County Donegal and the north west on waiting lists for Dublin hospitals where more complicated procedures are carried out, such as cardiac surgery, chemotherapy and radium treatment.  Many have been on the list for a year or more.  There are 153 on the Letterkenny General Hospital waiting list for over a year and in Sligo Regional Hospital the situation is more critical, where there are 269, excluding approximately 200 children.</P>
      <P>If one is fortunate enough to be in a position to pay for private treatment one can be admitted almost immediately.  This is a most unjust system. I know of people in County Donegal who have sacrificed their life savings to go private to relieve their pain and suffering.  Everybody agrees that the present situation cannot be allowed to continue. The Minister has failed dismally to deliver an adequate service.  His performance as Minister does not match the eloquence of his promise when he was in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More resources are urgently required.  The practice of ward closures during the summer and holiday periods must be discontinued.  There <Col N="83" /> should be more co-operation between the North-Western Health Board authorities and the Northern Ireland health authorities where under utilised facilities exist.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously address the scandal of waiting lists for admissions to hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A headline in today's <i>Irish Medical Times</i> states that more than one in three patients are on hospital waiting lists for one year. It goes on to report that, according to new figures, more than one in three patients have been on a hospital waiting list for in-patient treatment for over a year and that of the 30,777 patients on the targeted specialty waiting list nationwide at the end of June, 14,329 adults had been awaiting treatment for between three and 12 months while 12,319 have been on the list for over one year.</P>
      <P>The figures released by the Minister's Department showed an increase of 42 per cent in the waiting list for public in-patient treatment for Tralee General Hospital.  I subsequently checked with the Southern Health Board and it has revised those figures to 50 per cent.  This is unacceptable.  I wish to quote the following from a letter I received during the week from a concerned parent:</P>
      <P>I am writing to you in the hope that you might be able to do something for my son.  He has been on the waiting list for about one and a half years to get his tonsils out.  I am at the doctors every week or every two weeks with him.  He has not even been called to see [the consultant] yet.</P>
      <P>Every time I go to the doctors they say they have written or telephoned them, but no call has come for him.  I know there is a long waiting list but he is very sick with the tonsils and is also losing weight.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable and unjust that children should have had their school attendance disrupted by ongoing bouts of debilitating infection while the waiting list for ENT surgery grows longer by the month.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about the matter.</P>
      <P>The figures for Tralee General Hospital also indicate that the gynaecology waiting list had increased since June 1997 from 146 to 273, an increase of 127.  While there may be a reason for that, it is unacceptable that it should be allowed happen.  In addition, the waiting list for orthopaedics has increased from 82 last year to 106. The overall figures for Tralee General Hospital provided by the Minster's Department show an increase of 366, which is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at the problem in Tralee General Hospital, especially the ENT waiting lists.  There is a problem with all waiting lists there.  The lists for the other hospitals in the Southern Health Board region do not appear to be as bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter <Col N="84" /> on raising this important issue.  The Government is very popular and is riding high on the Celtic tiger.  However, unfortunately, for the elderly and those of whatever age on hospital waiting lists there appears to be no relief or no possibility that the problem will be resolved.  In my six years as a Member of Dáil Éireann I have never received so many complaints from people who cannot get an indication of when they will be called for their hip replacements operation, general orthopaedic surgery or whatever.  A total of 477 people, many of whom are from my constituency, are on a waiting list at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  It is unacceptable that they do not know when they will get relief from pain.  A total of 29 beds were closed in that hospital, a recipe for disaster.  Those people should be able to have the operations they need and the Minister should provide the necessary finance.  More than 500 people are on waiting lists at the Cavan-Monaghan surgical hospitals, which is not a record of which to be proud.</P>
      <P>I wish to follow up on Deputy McGinley's request that the Minister give serious consideration to the opportunities available through the Northern Ireland structures to deal with some of these problems.  In the past many people, even from as far away as Cork, travelled North for surgery and that improved the position.  We all hope the peace will last.  As a result of it, accommodation is available in many extremely high quality hospitals in Northern Ireland.  If the Minister cannot open beds in hospitals south of the Border, he should consider the opportunities that are available to relieve the dreadful pain many people are suffering.</P>
      <P>This is not the only area of the health services that is in crisis.  Many of the elderly who were in nursing homes in Northern Ireland have had to be taken out of them because of the scarcity of resources and others, who are incapable of looking after themselves, have had to return to their homes.  The indications are that the health services are in crisis and the buck stops with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for sharing time with me.  The most critical issues affecting Sligo General Hospital are in the area of medical admissions, day surgery facilities, the appointment of a second ophthalmic surgeon and a third general surgeon.  Medical admissions increased dramatically this year, but there has been a continuing increase in admissions dating back to the 1970s.  That has increased the demand for medical beds.  The provision of a dedicated day surgery unit would improve matters significantly.  Many hospitals in the South, including Letterkenny General Hospital, has such a unit.  It is generally accepted that such a unit is much more efficient, productive and involves significantly less cost per patient treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding childcare services and family support, the Minister will be familiar with the recent McColgan report.  While those services have improved since the 1980s and early l990s, we have <Col N="85" /> a responsibility to ensure the resources that are available are used to make the greatest impact possible on child protection and family support. Many more resources need to be devoted to this area.  Other areas which require further development include family support services, parenting and education programmes and the development of a youth strategy.  There is also a need for additional direct intervention by social workers, after hours social work services, a strengthening of support services for social work teams, the approval of additional premises in the Sligo-Leitrim region, ongoing training of foster parents, inter-agency co-ordination and purpose built residential homes.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that in the next 25 years there will be a 60 per cent increase in the number of people over the age of 85 in the Sligo-Leitrim area.  Demands for services for the elderly will continue to increase.  It is national policy that at least 90 per cent of the elderly, should be retained in their homes in so far as possible.  That demands significant resources by way of home help support. The hours worked by home helps could be doubled to maintain the standard required.  There must be a substantial additional allocation for the home help service which is inadequate in certain areas.  A good deal more could be done to keep the elderly at home.  A large number of elderly people live alone in very remote areas of Sligo-Leitrim. That area has the highest population of elderly in the country.  The North Western Health Board pays home helps less per hour than any other health board and I would like the Minister to examine that.  Primary health care is at the core of a comprehensive health care system.  There is a development programme for primary health care, but additional provision is required for the home help service.  Additional health centres are required and much more funding is necessary to develop centres which provide respite care.</P>
    <P>Sligo General Hospital requires the appointment of a third general surgeon.  The area requires three surgeons, one with a special interest in urology, one with a specific interest in the colon-rectal area and another with a special interest in cancer care.  The appointment of a third surgeon would assist greatly in dealing with that devastating condition that affects so many families.</P>
    <P>There is a long list of people waiting for an appointment for hip replacement operations. Given the additional revenue in the country, I appeal to the Minister to make more funds available to reduce the number on that waiting list.  It is unreal that people have to wait up to three years to get a hip replacement.  That is only one of the operations for which people are on waiting lists.  I appeal to the Minister to allocate additional resources to the North Western Health Board, which is doing outstanding work in the care of the young and the elderly and in all other areas of health care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for tabling <Col N="86" /> this timely motion.  Almost every Sunday evening one of my constituents, an elderly man who is a gentle soul, telephones me to know if there is any news.  He wants to know when he will have his hip replacement operation.  He has told me that he can hardly stand the pain he is suffering.  I go through the motions of telephoning the hospital, the consultant's secretary and I write letters, but I am told nothing can be done.  Initially I was told he was not on the waiting list.  That was before I understood there was a waiting list for waiting lists.  I then discovered he was put on the waiting list four or five months after he had been seen initially.  I could not understand why that was the case, but it might have been done to show the figures in a slightly better light.  Perhaps we could find out how many are on the waiting list for waiting lists.  That constituent telephoned me last Sunday night and asked if he would have his operation sooner if he were able to scrape together a few pounds.</P>
      <P>I tabled five questions to the Minister for Health and Children last week and his reply consisted of five or six lines.  I asked him the average time people have to wait for hip replacement operations in the orthopaedic hospital in Cork, but he declined to put that information on the record.  I asked him how many operations were carried out each month over the past year, which should have been easy to find out, but he declined to put that information on the record.  I asked how many of those people hold medical cards, which should also have been easy to find out, but he also declined to put that information on the record.  My biggest fear is that matters are a good deal worse than they appear.</P>
      <P>Another constituent, who is housebound and has been waiting for a hip replacement operation for months telephoned to say she is in terrible pain.  She has great difficulty and requires assistance to get in and out of her car.  We can quote statistics and facts, but we are dealing with people who are in real pain and who have real problems. I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to alleviate suffering, especially among the elderly who are defenseless.  I take it the Minister is a compassionate man.  I urge him and his colleagues in Government to do more because much more needs to be done.  It is not good enough that the number of people on waiting lists has risen dramatically since this Minister took office.  I urge him to make an effort.</P>
      <P>It is not fair on the staff of Cork University Hospital that they must ask people to wait all day for minor operations and x-rays.  It is not the fault of the staff but is due to a lack of resources.  Some people have had to stay on trolleys in corridors and that is happening throughout the country.  I urge the Minister, in the name of humanity, to act on this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" />&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(1) commends the Minister for Health and Children for allocating £12 million in 1998 to deal with waiting lists, which represents a 50 per cent increase in the sum allocated by the previous Government in 1997 as an important initial step towards implementing a comprehensive programme to address the issue, commencing immediately,</P>
    <P>(2) notes that the Minister for Health and Children has undertaken the first ever formal analysis of the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times which enables a comprehensive overview of the needs of the health care system towards addressing the issue, and</P>
    <P>(3) endorses his on-going strategy of dealing with waiting lists and waiting times in a structured, co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary manner, involving all components of the health care system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity tonight to deal with the issue of waiting lists and to outline what the Government is doing to tackle the matter. I am conscious that the issue of waiting lists is one which gives rise to genuine concern among members of the public.</P>
    <P>While the actual numbers on public waiting lists have been on the increase recently, little, if any, attention has been paid to the length of time that patients must wait.  The length of time spent by public patients on waiting lists in a number of important specialties has actually been reduced in recent months and in other specialties it has remained static.</P>
    <P>For example, waiting times for adults requiring treatment in cardiac surgery, general surgery and urology fell between March and June of this year. Similarly there were improvements in waiting times for children in cardiac surgery and ear, nose and throat procedures.  It is vital from the very beginning of my contribution to stress that looking solely at numbers will distract us from the real issue of how long patients are waiting for treatment. That is the issue for every individual referred to by each Deputy as regards their own regions &mdash; how long must they wait?</P>
    <P>In addressing the question of waiting lists and waiting times, we must remember that they are an international issue.  No country has wiped them out, nor can any country claim that it is easy to reduce them very quickly.  A number of practical difficulties arise, irrespective of how much funding is available to deal with waiting lists.</P>
    <P>When it becomes apparent that inroads are being made in a lengthy waiting list, new cases tend to be added quickly to the list to replace those who have received a service.  This is entirely understandable, but it again underlines how inadvisable it is to look at waiting lists in isolation from waiting times.  Waiting lists can be replenished by additional patients.  The important point, <Col N="88" /> however, is that these patients are receiving a service without undue delay.</P>
    <P>The increase in the population, especially the older population, has resulted in an increased need for health care generally and hospital care in particular.  The demand for health care has been increasing continually.  As we make advances in technology, it is medically possible for patients to receive services for conditions that were previously treatable or treated as successfully.</P>
    <P>Even a sustained and successful effort to reduce existing lists may not address the underlying cause of waiting lists developing in the first instance.  Waiting lists can arise due to inadequate staffing or equipment, problems with management of the hospital's facilities, shortages of non-acute facilities or a combination of these factors. It is vital therefore, to address the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times so that the available funding is targeted very clearly at addressing them.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it is not possible to deal effectively with waiting lists and waiting times within the acute hospital system alone.  Each component of the health care system has a role to play. Addressing their interdependence is a critical factor in dealing with the issue in the long-term. Before dealing further with the underlying causes of waiting lists, I propose to review briefly the approach taken towards reducing waiting lists by successive Governments over the past few years.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government introduced a new waiting list initiative.  It was based on allocating separate, dedicated funding to participating health board hospitals and voluntary hospitals so that they could carry out a specified number of elective procedures for patients who had been waiting for significant periods of time on a public waiting list.  It was agreed with agencies that the work must relate to patients awaiting treatment and must be over and above the activity that would have been performed in the hospital from normal funding.</P>
    <P>A total of £20 million was allocated to that in 1993 and by the end of that year, the total numbers awaiting treatment had fallen from 40,000 to 25,000.  A further £10 million was allocated under the waiting list initiative in 1994 and waiting lists fell further by the end of the year to just under 24,000, a decrease of just 1,000.  The progress made in those years was partly because of the level of funding that we allocated and partly because there was some spare capacity in the hospital system to take on additional activity.  It is clear that in the case of some hospitals spare capacity has now been fully utilised and it will be necessary now to assess the capacity of individual hospitals to take on additional work.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the Government that took office at the end of 1994, comprising Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, the impetus for serious attention to waiting lists declined.  A degree of complacency set in in tackling waiting lists and waiting times after the initial successes and that Government's reaction to rising waiting <Col N="89" /> lists was, as a result, unplanned, unstructured and did not heed the danger signs in failing to maintain the momentum which could be seen in the 1994 figures.</P>
    <P>It did not build on the initial success of the previous Government, reducing investment on the assumption that spare capacity was utilised fully and undertaking little analysis of the impact of the reduced investment.  The previous Government allowed funding for waiting list activity to fall to £8 million and the negative effect this had on the numbers waiting will not be easy to undo. However, I am committed to addressing the problems that have arisen as a result of that.</P>
    <P>The numbers on waiting lists and the length of waiting times for many specialties inexorably rose during the period 1995-7.  When the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government took office in December 1994, waiting lists stood at 24,000. When they left office in June 1997 waiting lists had increased to over 30,000.  They rose to 32,000 by December 1997 due in part to the allocation by that Government of just £8 million for waiting list work again in 1997.  This represents an increase of 33.3 per cent during the lifetime of the previous Government.  With the reduced funding provided by the Rainbow Government, waiting lists rose by one third.</P>
    <P>We can argue the facts here all night and the Opposition can refer to increases since I took office and I can refer to increases during the last Administration.  However, the facts stand as they are.  It is important to emphasise that in the years in which funding for waiting lists fell to £8 million &mdash; such as in 1995 and 1997, when the parties opposite were in office &mdash; waiting lists increased substantially.  They rose by 4,000 in 1995 and by 6,200 in 1997.  This suggests that, for the foreseeable future, we need more significant funding to address the problem of waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It was with this in mind that I allocated £12 million for waiting list work this year, which represents an increase of 50 per cent over the funding made available by the previous Government in 1997.  The additional funding will result in an extra 15,000 procedures being carried out during the current year.  Again, I caution against the simplistic approach of counting numbers only, with no regard to waiting times, but it is quite clear that adequate funding is required to support a sufficient level of dedicated hospital work to reduce both waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>When we came into office, we gave a clear commitment to tackling the problem of waiting lists and waiting times in a planned and structured way, starting with an analysis of the underlying causes of waiting lists.  Since taking office, I have taken a number of initiatives in relation to the operation of the waiting lists as they then were.  I ensured that hospitals received earlier notification of the level of funding that was to be made available to them under this initiative.  They received details of their waiting list funding in December whereas in previous years the funding for waiting lists tended not to be allocated until <Col N="90" /> July.  This earlier notice has enabled hospitals to plan their activities more easily with money for the waiting list initiative now being made available during the course of the full year.  This provides for better planning on the part of health agencies.</P>
    <P>I placed an increased focus on waiting times as well as waiting lists so that we would not lose sight of our major concern, that is, to reduce the length of time patients must await treatment on a public waiting list.  The target is that children should have to wait no longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention.  I instructed hospitals to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with my Department on waiting list issues.</P>
    <P>The changes will take some time to have effect but they are an important starting point and should be acknowledged as such.  The Government has implemented a more planned and structured approach to the issue of waiting lists.  I took one further vital step in April this year, that was to establish the first ever formal analysis of waiting lists and waiting times.  I appointed an expert review group on the waiting list initiative drawn from the clinicians who provide treatment under the initiative, the managers who oversee it and officials of the Department.  Its terms of reference were to examine the underlying factors giving rise to waiting lists and waiting times and to make recommendations on the most appropriate means of addressing the underlying causes of substantial waiting lists and waiting times.  The review was to have particular regard to the net effect of the waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting times; any incentive effects of the waiting list initiative on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate waiting lists, and the adequacy of existing information systems, which have been criticised, to permit routine evaluation of the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>The review group comprised consultants in the specialties of accident and emergency, cardiology, orthopaedic surgery and geriatrics.  It also included a general practitioner, a specialist in public health medicine, a former chief executive of a major Dublin teaching hospital, a deputy chief medical officer and other senior officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>The urgency I attach to this issue is underlined by the fact that the review group reported rapidly within a few months of its establishment.  I received its report in mid-August.  I thank the members for their work.  I consider it to be a useful contribution, as an analysis of the causes of waiting lists and as the basis for the work which is under way as a priority in the Department on the development of a comprehensive plan to address the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>I propose to present the plan to Government as soon as the logistics of what is a complex exercise <Col N="91" /> have been worked out carefully.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough the commitment of the Government to deal with the issue but it will not attempt to do so in a short-term, knee-jerk manner.  Waiting lists and waiting times can only be dealt with in a structured, co-ordinated way, involving all components of the health care system working together.  This involves developing a long-term plan, not merely attempts at quick fix solutions.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group sets out a logical and structured means of addressing waiting lists and waiting times.  These include, as immediate-term objectives, a further study of hospital capacity to be carried out as a matter of urgency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a review of information systems by agencies to ensure they can maintain accurate and up-to-date waiting list initiative data &mdash; agencies should be assisted if specific shortfalls are identified; a bulk postal review of patients on waiting lists where hospitals have not done so in the previous 12 months; the encouragement of an improved flow of information between primary and hospital care regarding the status of patients on waiting lists; a continued move towards day case work, the appointment of bed managers and bed utilisation committees; agreement under each agency's service plan regarding the mix of public and private patients treated, and a written policy on planning the discharge of older patients and liaising with community based services.</P>
      <P>The review group recommended, as medium-term objectives in 1999, that WLI funding should focus on a limited number of specialties and take the greatest possible account of health and social gain; that the Department of Health and Children should consider introducing possible financial incentives for hospitals to reduce their waiting times; that protocols be developed in all major waiting list specialties for the validation and prioritisation of cases, and that a number of measures be pursued to reduce the pressure from accident and emergency services on acute beds.</P>
      <P>The review group recommended, as long-term objectives from 1999 to 2001 &mdash; these are focused primarily on freeing up acute hospital beds &mdash; the development of geriatric day hospitals and rehabilitation facilities on the site of acute hospitals; the development of a planned programme of investment in appropriate facilities for those in need of long-term care; that the case for providing stand-alone day surgery units on the site of acute hospitals for acute patients should be examined closely, and that the question of providing additional hospital or other short-term accommodation for patients who do not otherwise need to stay overnight in an acute bed should be pursued as a means of reducing unnecessary hospital stays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group highlights the <Col N="92" /> main pressures on the health system, particularly the features that give rise to problems in meeting the genuine needs of public patients.  Some of the most important of these features relate to an increase in the total population; an increasing number of older people in the population with consequent need for additional short-term and longer-term facilities, and increasing demands for health care generally and acute hospital care in particular.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the specific needs of older persons, it should be remembered that the population as a whole has grown by 150,000 since 1990. As the in-patient capacity of acute hospitals has remained virtually static in recent years, its ability to cope with the increased demand arising from the growth in the population has been greatly challenged.  At the same time there has been a growing demand on acute hospital facilities with the number of persons treated as in-patients and as day cases rising significantly in recent years.</P>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People projects an increase of nearly 30 per cent in the population aged over 65 from 1991 to 2011 and, more significantly, an absolute increase from 74,000 to 130,000 in the number of persons aged over 80 years in the same period.  On average, those over the age of 65 consume four times more hospital and community resources than the rest of the population.  The higher usage of hospital services by the older age groups will place increasing pressure on acute beds and waiting list activity.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern is the recent survey of acute hospitals by my Department which indicates that at least 3.5 per cent of acute hospital in-patient beds are occupied by patients who through no fault of their own are inappropriately placed.  These include older patients who do not require or who no longer require acute care.  An example would be persons who have made a good recovery after surgery and who no longer need acute care but who are not ready to go home. Another example would be older people who require longer-term care rather than the intensive treatment offered in an acute hospital setting but who cannot gain access to appropriate non-acute facilities.</P>
    <P>The figure of 3.5 per cent of patients who are inappropriately placed in acute care is equivalent to approximately 150,000 bed days per year.  The Government is committed to tackling this figure and ensuring all acute hospital beds are freed up for the purpose for which they are intended.  Success in utilising these 150,000 bed days for acute care as opposed to other forms of longer-term non-acute care would have a major impact on the ability of hospitals to carry out their waiting list work.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group elaborates on the factors which lead to an increased demand for acute hospital facilities by older people and others needing long-term care.  These include the shortage of appropriate community services and day assessment services which contribute to inappropriate <Col N="93" /> admissions of older patients to acute hospitals; insufficient provision of rehabilitation facilities which results in an increase in the average length of stay for patients, even when the initial referral was appropriate; insufficient liaison between acute and community services which can lead to unsatisfactory discharge planning and an unnecessary prolongation of hospital stays; a shortage of long-term care facilities which can result in excessive utilisation of acute in-patient facilities by older patients, and a poorly developed service for older patients suffering from dementia associated with behavioural disturbance which often results in inappropriate referral to acute hospital services or an inability to discharge them after an appropriate admission to an acute hospital.</P>
    <P>The review group's findings in this area serve to underline the fact that inappropriate placements in acute hospitals, whether of older people or of others such as stroke victims and those involved in serious road traffic accidents, cannot be addressed by hospitals alone.  The review group rightly argues for a co-ordinated approach right across the board from primary care to acute hospital services and on to sub-acute and longer-term forms of care.  It is only when we address the issue of waiting lists in that manner that we will make real progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>To this end the review group has highlighted the need for facilities which will first benefit older persons and others needing long-term care and, second, which will free up acute hospital facilities for their core business, including treatments for those on a waiting list.  These facilities include geriatric day hospitals for the assessment and planning of treatment of older persons, rehabilitation facilities for older persons and others with chronic conditions, community nursing units to meet the long-term residential care needs of older persons, commuity-based support services such as home help, physiotherapy and speech therapy services and hostel and other short-term accommodation for patients who do not otherwise need to stay overnight in an acute hospital bed.</P>
    <P>Our policy in Government seeks to recognise these facts and we must build on them.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, was appointed with special responsibility for older people.  In 1997, its last year in office, the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government made available £3 million for a capital programme for older people.  That was the figure and that was the commitment.  This year alone my colleague, Deputy Moffatt, and I are making available almost £14 million capital moneys for the development of facilities for older people and we must do more.  The review group highlights the importance of this and we will continue with this significant investment programme.</P>
    <P>The report argues that the case for providing stand-alone day surgery units for acute patients should be examined closely.  It also points to the <Col N="94" /> need to develop closer relationships between primary care and hospital services and to take further measures to reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>As regards the review group's report, the Government is committed to implementing its recommendations as quickly as possible.  As I mentioned earlier, my Department is currently working on the implementation of the report.  As a first step, it has commenced the assessment of the current capacity of the acute hospital system and I have asked that this work be completed shortly.  I assure the House that the Government is not lacking in its will to tackle the problem of waiting lists, but in a planned and co-ordinated fashion.  It is clear that implementation of the report will involve a well developed working relationship between all sectors of the health service. We will need a partnership approach in which primary care, acute hospitals and continuing care services work closely together to achieve the maximum benefit.  We will need the continuing enthusiastic co-operation of consultant medical staff in implementing a successful waiting list initiative but we will need to go further.  The entire health system must be harnessed to address a key priority problem which we all recognise as unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to place the numbers on waiting lists and the performance of the waiting list initiative in context.  First, the number of people on waiting lists on 30 June 1998 was 34,331. Within this figure there is a wide spectrum of ill-health among the patients waiting for different procedures.  In this context the length of time waiting is not the sole determinant of access to treatment.  The severity of the person's condition is also important and, irrespective of which criterion is used to determine access to treatment, it is clear that a large number of patients are waiting too long for surgery.</P>
    <P>While the current numbers on waiting lists are clearly not satisfactory, this figure must be set against the total number of patients who have been treated over the past year.  In 1997, for example, there were over 535,000 in-patient discharges from acute hospitals and a further 250,000 day cases.  The waiting list figure of 34,331 represents 6.4 per cent of all in-patients and 13.7 per cent of day cases seen in acute hospitals last year.  When the total activity of 535,000 in-patient discharges and 250,000 day cases are combined the numbers on public waiting lists represents 4.4 per cent of all such activity.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that, contrary to some claims, the level of activity in acute hospitals has been rising noticeably since the beginning of the year. For example, overall acute in-patient acitivity between January and June 1998 increased by over 1 per cent and the increase for day case activity in the same period was almost 10 per cent.  This underlines the fact that our acute hospitals are working extremely hard to meet the demands placed on them and that they are to be commended for their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> We have now spent a total of £70 million under the waiting list initiative since its inception in 1993.  There have been some claims in the media that this £70 million has been wasted or that it has failed to reduce waiting lists in the way that was intended.  This claim does not stand up to close examination.  While waiting lists remain a significant problem, we must remember that the £70 million was used to treat thousands of patients over the past five years who would otherwise have been waiting for a much longer period of time.  These include vital treatments such as hip replacements, cataract procedures, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery &mdash; all treated as a direct result of the funding provided.</P>
    <P>Put simply, this money helped to treat public patients much faster than if a separate stream of funding had not been made available for those on waiting lists.  In the years 1993 to 1997, a total of 85,000 patients benefited from the waiting list initiative.  I anticipate that at least a further 15,000 patients approximately will benefit in 1998 as a result of the £12 million allocated this year.  This will bring the total number of patients benefiting from the waiting list initiative to 100,000 since it began in 1993.  We should bear these facts in mind before claiming that the money allocated to waiting lsts has had little effect.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the money has been used in a highly efficient manner.  For example, last year the hospitals participating in the waiting list initiative set out to carry out some 7,500 procedures for those in the target specialities. In fact, the hospitals managed to carry out over 11,000 procedures under the waiting list initiative.  This year we estimate the figure will be 15,000.  The fact that waiting lists have not decreased despite that efficient performance underlines the speed at which patients can be added to the list.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to one particular area in which the waiting list initiative has been noticeably successful.  This is the area of cardiac surgery which has been adverted to by Deputy Shatter.  Without going through the matter in detail I must highlight the fact that the approach we have adopted is bringing about results and is reducing the time spent on waiting lists.  My Department is attempting to apply this type of approach to a wider number of specialities as a result of the findings of the review group.  That approach provides us with the best prospect of success.</P>
    <P>I have set out the progress of the waiting list initiative to date and I have pointed to the challenges involved in reducing both waiting lists and waiting times.  I believe that if we are to have a debate about waiting lists it must be an informed one.  We must quickly depart from the simplistic notions put forward in some quarters about waiting lists alone.  So too must we accept that solving this issue will require a co-ordinated approach, using the partnership idea across the entire health service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> The factors that give rise to waiting lists and the success with which they are addressed are complex.  I believe the review group's report represents a very valuable starting point from here and I am committed to adopting its recommended approach in dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>I am willing to discuss strategies on how best to address the waiting list issue with all interested parties throughout the health system and central to this is an acceptance that the rate of change in medical and surgical has moved on substantially. The model of the acute hospital system as a single multi-purpose facility for treatment, recuperation and rehabilitation is simply no longer valid. Patients need a continuum of care involving all components of the system.  We must work on the basis that co-operation between all sections of the health system is critical and that waiting lists are not just an acute hospital issue.  The interdependencies between sectors is vital and must be recognised by all concerned.  The long-term strategy proposed by the review group will have an impact on all levels of our health and personal social services and it is essential that the relevant developments are planned and implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>The Government, unlike its immediate predecessor, will not rush into short-term panaceas for dealing with waiting lists and waiting times.  We are dealing with the issue as a matter of priority and we are prepared to devote the energy required to address the medium and long-term requirements as well as those in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The review group has moved the argument from anecdotal opinion to a comprehensive review of what needs to happen to shorten waiting times for those awaiting surgery.  That systematic analysis had to be done first.  I am now in a position to make the argument for an improvement programme which seeks not only more resources but holds out the prospect of achieving better results for that investment as well.</P>
    <P>The last Government's response to growing waiting lists was to reduce the funding and do no analysis of what was happening.  When this Government took office, I negotiated an Estimate for 1998 which increased the funding to £12 million &mdash; a 50 per cent increase &mdash; as an initial step to undo the damage done during the tenure of the previous Government.  I have conducted an in-depth analysis and I am now properly armed with the arguments that can be made to Government. I am in the process of devising a comprehensive response to the major challenges highlighted in the review group's report.</P>
    <P>As soon as the deliberative process is over and the Government has taken decisions in the context of Estimates and budgetary discussion I will, of course, make copies of the report available to all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The Opposition can be assured that it is not the intention of this Government to repeat its mistakes regarding the handling of this issue.  The Government will not be complacent as its predecessor became.  I am committed to giving public <Col N="97" /> patients a fairer deal than they are getting at the moment.  It requires focused investment in a range of areas and equally important, co-ordinated action across a number of fronts.  The House can be assured that a response commensurate with the complex problem which we are discussing this evening will be forthcoming and it will certainly compare far more favourably with the inadequate and complacent approach of the previous Administration which can be clearly gleaned from the facts as I have outlined them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before us tonight and I thank Fine Gael for using its Private Members' time to discuss the critical problems associated with the current hospital waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Before the summer recess I tabled a Private Members' motion on the crisis in our health services. A month later, that crisis has worsened but the Minister has continued to sit on the fence.  I welcome the opportunity to remind the Minister that we urgently need investment in our health services.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House tonight to debate this motion because it appears, of late, that he has been dodging debate.  He failed to appear on a number of key current affairs programmes where health was one of the main topics for discussion.  He has failed to attend in this House on a number of occasions when Adjournment Debates relating to his portfolio were being discussed.  The Minister also suppressed debate and criticism from the Opposition by his failure to put key reports into the public domain.  The reality of our health services, now more than ever, is that those who can pay get treatment while those who cannot must wait.</P>
      <P>The Minister is presiding over a health service which is rapidly falling apart.  Hospital wards are being closed, waiting lists are growing, there is a serious shortage of nursing staff and an acute shortage of nursing home places, yet no attempt has been made to ensure we are getting value for money.</P>
      <P>Figures recently released by the Department show that one in every three patients on a waiting list has been waiting for treatment for over a year. Among these people on waiting lists are an unacceptable number of children &mdash; 2,413 children have been waiting for in-patient treatment for over six months while a further 1,721 children have been waiting for between three and six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 1,000 children are on hospital waiting lists in Temple Street Children's Hospital.  That is an appalling indictment of the Minister's stewardship in the Department of Health and Children. If he took the trouble to visit Temple Street Children's Hospital he would see the deplorable conditions <Col N="98" /> in which people are trying to work.  Major problems are being experienced in relation to funding to cut waiting lists.  As I said, over 1,000 children are waiting for procedures and various operations but it appears these are only figures to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think about the impact of recurrent tonsillitis or hearing problems on young children, the amount of time they miss from school and the suffering caused as a result.  A person attended my clinic over the weekend whose child was put on a waiting list in Temple Street for a tonsillectomy at the age of ten months.  The child will be four years old next month and that parent is still waiting to get on to the real waiting list.  They were informed recently that all children likely to be called in the next two years have been notified, so the parent of this child cannot hope to be called in the next two years.  The child will be six years of age before they are likely to be called; that is totally unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to pay urgent attention to the fact that there are so many children awaiting hospital operations.</P>
    <P>Every hospital in the country is being plunged into a crisis and they simply cannot cope with the numbers seeking treatments.  One of the worst waiting lists cited recently was the 2,761 people awaiting operations for the removal of varicose veins at the University Hospital Galway; more than half those people have been waiting for more than a year.</P>
    <P>In April, a review of hospital waiting lists was commissioned by the Minister.  Despite the fact that the problem has become much worse over recent months, it appears the Minister is happy to sit on that report.  He has had it for almost three months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we have not yet seen it.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us some indication tonight of what might be contained in the report, but why is he keeping it quiet?  Why will he not put it into the public domain, allow us have a proper debate and identify the underlying problems that have led us to this crisis?  It does not make sense for the Minister to sit on the report.  It is a report from an expert group and we should know what the experts say.  We need to find out what is required and then see how the Minister fares in the budget.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give an undertaking tonight that he will publish the report as a matter of urgency and, more importantly, that he will take the steps necessary to implement its recommendations. We are facing into another winter during which the crisis will undoubtedly get worse.  Little hope is being offered that there will be any improvement in the position until well into the new year.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems associated with the soaring waiting lists are due to the fact that insufficient resources have been made available to <Col N="99" /> health boards and hospitals.  The Minister was unfair in his approach to this in so far as he has attempted to hide behind the accountability legislation. Hospitals and health boards outline clearly the extent of their problems and the funding that is required to address them, but invariably the Minister's response is that they must live within their budgets.  We all should live within a certain budget but the Minister is ignoring the fact that the budgets allocated to hospitals and health boards were inadequate.  He did not get sufficient funding for the health services in the last budget and he is trying to force the hospitals and health boards to live within very inadequate budgets.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stop hiding behind the accountability legislation.  At this time of the year that legislation is kicking in and it is having a serious effect in terms of bed closures, etc.  A person attended my clinic over the weekend who had an outpatient appointment for November.  The person had waited nine months for the appointment and got a letter the other day stating that, regrettably, the hospital had to cancel it due to financial difficulties.  The hospital was not in a position to indicate when another appointment would be made.  Will we see not only inpatient services being reduced but out patient services also?</P>
    <P>It is impossible for health boards and hospitals to meet the demands placed on them because of inadequate budgets.  As we all know, hospitals have been forced to close beds simply to save money.  When the country is awash with money and we hear stories about hugely inflated standards of living and vast amounts of money being spent, the public cannot understand how the hospitals are closing beds to save money.  That exacerbates the waiting list problem and the numbers on the lists soar.</P>
    <P>The summer is an important time for hospitals because it provides a breathing space from the huge pressures on the accident and emergency departments.  The summer months should be used to make inroads on the waiting lists when there is not such pressure on the beds from casualty departments.  Unfortunately that opportunity was missed this year and we face further chaos in the winter months.  There was no progress because hospitals were forced to close beds.  The hospitals did not do this for standard maintenance work, they were forced to close beds to save money because the budget the Minister allocated was inadequate.  That is unacceptable in a civilised society.</P>
    <P>Hospitals and health boards are being blamed for the lengthening waiting lists when quite clearly they are not at fault.  The Minister has played both sides; he promised to go to the Minister for Finance to see how much funding he could get and he said he would fight his corner and do his bit at the Cabinet table.  As public representatives we are all aware of the crisis in our health services.  Surely the Minister's Cabinet colleagues are aware of it as well.  He cannot play <Col N="100" /> one side off against the other like that.  Is the Government committed to doing something?</P>

      <P>Either this Government is serious about tackling the crisis in the health service or not.  Let us see the Cabinet take responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>An area I have tried to draw to the attention of the Minister over the past year to which he seemed oblivious for many months, and to which he has only recently copped on, is the inadequate supply of nursing home places.  I was amused to hear him mention a written policy on the discharge of elderly patients from acute hospitals, as if that will make a whit of difference.  Has the Minister spoken to people in the acute hospitals?</P>

      <P>If the Minister had spoken to anyone in Beaumont, St. James's or any of the large acute hospitals 12 months ago, they would have <Col N="101" /> told him their most pressing problem was hospital beds blocked by people who are inappropriately placed.  I do not know why we have to wait months for the report of a review group to tell us that when it was clearly the case.  Action should have been taken last winter to ensure we would not face the same crisis this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity has been lost this year because we will not be in a position to provide proper places.  It is a disgrace that almost 500 people are inappropriately placed in acute hospital beds.  That means 500 acute beds are blocked indefinitely.  The priority must be to clear those beds by providing appropriate step down facilities for those patients.  The Minister seems to accept that fact about our health services and is talking about doing something in the future.</P>
      <P>During the summer a state of the art nursing home was completed by the Eastern Health Board in the Glasnevin area in my constituency. It is fully equipped, yet in the north side of Dublin, 25 per cent of operations are cancelled due to shortages of beds in Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital because of bed blockages.  Mean-while, a fully equipped, 50 bed nursing home lies idle in Glasnevin.  That is a disgrace.  It is an indictment of this Minster who has not got the foresight to see that providing the money necessary to open that nursing home &mdash; which could be opened tomorrow if the will existed &mdash; would allow 50 beds to be cleared on the north side of Dublin, allowing significant progress to be made on the extremely long waiting lists in that area. Does it take a review group to point out these self evident facts to the Minister?  Was the review group set up to delay taking the necessary action? We were told at the start of the year when the problem came to notice, when the hospitals complained and the public was outraged, that this urgent review would be set in motion.</P>

We all have access to the demographic figures and know what will be needed this <Col N="102" /> year and next year.  What planning has been done to ensure adequate places will be provided to deal with the elderly in particular?</P>
      <P>Is there any point asking the Minister to give a commitment to open the new St. Clare's Hospital?  I have asked on a number of occasions but it seems that the winter will be over before there is any chance of that happening.</P>
      <P>There is huge unease among nurses over their pay, conditions and lack of career structure.  Such is the unease that nurses are voting with their feet by leaving nursing and entering other paramedical areas.  Young people are not entering the profession. The absolute minimum needed is the full implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
      <P>Many other things need to be done in relation to nursing.  We must introduce the idea of permanent part-time nurses on a widespread basis.  The majority of nurses are female and many female workers want the option of flexible working time; this is unavailable to most people but it must be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister has completely neglected value for money.  He has displayed a general failure to ensure accountability among our hospitals regarding cost.  There are no clear indications available to the taxpayer regarding value for money in our hospitals.  We do not know how much a hip replacement operation costs in Cork compared to Limerick or Dublin; we do not know the success rates of operations.</P>
      <P>Given that he promised so much, the Minister has delivered very little.  The time for defensiveness and the history lessons have gone.  The Minister is in charge.  It is his responsibility to tackle the problem.  What is needed is action as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Charitable Status.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the valuable and priceless work being done by more than 10,000 voluntary community and non-profit organisations throughout the country, at local and national level.  Many of these have charitable status in tax law but some do not.  Charitable status is important in terms of the morale of the organisations and also in practical ways, such as legal exemption from DIRT, which is an asset to any organisation fund raising in the USA in particular. In the last few years the large organisations raised funds from business under section 61 of the Finance Act, 1998, and from a local credit union under section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is remarkable about charitable status in this era of freedom of information is the secrecy that surrounds it.  Many worthy organisations carry the words &ldquo;registered charity&rdquo; on their <Col N="103" /> headed paper.  In Ireland there is no such thing as a registered charity; there are only organisations which the Revenue Commissioners have decided, in secret, have charitable status in tax law.</P>
    <P>Through the operation of revenue foregone, every organisation that has charitable status is subsidised by the ordinary taxpaying man and woman.  The ordinary PAYE taxpayer is denied access by the Revenue to information on who are the beneficiaries of this subsidy.  Potentially the absence of a register of charities and the failure of successive Governments to provide for the appointment of a registrar of charities creates a problem for charities in which the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for the accuracy of advertising, might take an interest. The crux of the issue is the question of secrecy, as provided for by a former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, Mr. Charles Haughey when framing the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have witnessed the effects on the pockets of ordinary taxpayers of the Revenue acting in secret.  In the case of AIB, the Revenue appears to have made decisions in private which cost ordinary taxpayers over £80 million.  I have failed to get from the Minister for Finance, despite persistent questioning by way of parliamentary questions, an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of the operation of charitable status in the period since 1967.  Most of that Exchequer cost would have the whole hearted support of the public but because of the culture of secrecy within which the Revenue has exercised its discretion in relation to its charitable status, we do not know, for instance, whether, in the late 1960s and right up to the time of the establishment of the Costello Committee of 1989, charitable status may have been used indirectly to facilitate party political fund raising.  Secrecy breeds suspicion. We have witnessed time and again, regrettably, that where the public is not vigilant, abuses &mdash; such as the Goodman scandal, the AIB scandal and various scandals associated with Fianna Fáil Administrations since the late 1960s &mdash; have proliferated. Thus the cloud of secrecy around charitable status is a scandal waiting to emerge.</P>
    <P>What is needed is the publication of a compendium of all organisations which have been granted charitable status since the passage of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Nothing less will do.  I challenge the Minister to come clean and to publish that list before Christmas.  There is a precedent for such a publication in the compendium of national lottery grants 1986-96.  This is nothing new.  We need the immediate publication of a register of all organisations currently active which have charitable status and the immediate appointment or designation <i>pro tem</i> of a registrar of charities or charities commission.  Failure to act on these three requests will add to the suspicion of what is in progress.</P>
    <P>The Government will have many questions to answer when the tribunals begin their public work in the near future and in the interests of <Col N="104" /> those charitable bodies that are legitimate and honest, it should move without delay to ensure that order and transparency are brought to bear on an area that has for too long been the preserve of an administrative inner golden circle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain tax advantages available to organisations that are considered to be charitable bodies.  A charity is defined in the tax legislation as any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only.  The tax legislation does not define what charitable purpose is but the courts over the years have defined four categories of charitable purpose as follows: the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the community not falling within the three other categories.  Any group of persons or trust that wishes to obtain charitable exemption from certain taxes must apply to the Revenue Commissioners who operate under the particular criteria to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>If a body is given charitable exemption by the Revenue Commissioners that body is entitled to exemption from income tax, corporation tax, deposit interest retention tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and probate tax.  These tax benefits are substantial and are of considerable assistance to charities in the State.</P>
      <P>This year, the Minister for Finance introduced a tax relief for donations by companies to eligible charities.  The relief is available for donations to any single charity between £250 and £10,000. There is also a cap on the total amount that a company can donate in total to charities in any one year.  This is the lesser of either £50,000 or 10 per cent of the company profits in any accounting period.  To be eligible for this relief the recipient must be established for charitable purposes only, apply its income for that purpose and have been exempted from taxes under the Revenue rules for at least three years.</P>
      <P>Information is not published generally on who has charitable status under tax rules.  The view is taken that this is a matter of an individual body's tax affairs.  This issue was raised in parliamentary questions asked by the Deputy and answered on 30 September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out in that reply the question of whether more general information, such as details of tax exemptions granted to taxpayers should be made available to the public by the Revenue Commissioners, has come up for decision under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  That Act provides for the non-disclosure of information given to a public body in confidence where disclosure would be likely to prejudice the giving of further similar information to that body from the same person or other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> The Revenue Commissioners' view is that the non-disclosure of information they receive in confidence in the ordinary way from taxpayers, including information received in the course of applications for exemptions, is an important element underpinning voluntary compliance with the tax laws and in maintaining public confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>However, the matter of releasing the names and addresses of bodies granted exemption as charitable bodies is being adjudicated on by the Information Commissioner who is responsible for reviewing decisions not to release information under the Freedom of Information Act.  The Information Commissioner will decide whether the maintenance of the confidentiality principle in this particular matter outweighs any public interest concerns.</P>
    <P>In the case of those charitable bodies who are eligible to accept tax relieved donations under the scheme which the Minister introduced in the 1998 Finance Act, the Minister did provide for the names of those bodies to be published by the Revenue Commissioners and these are being sent to the Deputy.  There are 215 such bodies on the list.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that the role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to charities is confined to consideration of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from tax on the basis that they are established for charitable purposes only.  The issue of the general regulation of charities and the question of the appointment of a registrar of charities is the responsibility of the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I understand from our colleague that the report of the Costello committee on fund raising activities for charitable and other purposes included recommendations in relation to registration arrangements for professional fund raisers and consultants.  A subsequent advisory group on charities fund raising legislation also made recommendations on this matter.  The implementation of these reports is also a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The reform of the law in this area is included among the items in his legislative programme. While it is not possible to give any firm indication when proposals for a Bill might be ready for submission to Government, it is the intention that work will proceed as quickly as possible in the light of the disposal of other legislative priorities.</P>
    <P>Since the appointment of a registrar of charities on an interim basis would, in itself, almost certainly necessitate legislation, I am not sure how this would achieve the result which is intended. In the circumstances, and in view of the decision being awaited under the Freedom of Information Act, I do not believe the sort of interim measures called for are required.  I trust this clarifies the mater for the Deputy.  My clinic is available to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's newspapers announced that £185 million would be spent this year on water and sewerage schemes but the Castlerea scheme will not be included in this allocation.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government says we must clamp down on pollution, yet Castlerea has a substandard sewerage scheme which is over capacity and is polluting the river Suck.  There is not much point combating eutrophication on Lough Derg when the system in Castlerea is dilapidated and raw sewage is running into the lake from the Ballintober scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government is drawing up a White Paper on rural development and is talking about developing the west.  The people of Castlerea campaigned for a prison when no other town would campaign for such a development because they needed investment and something to attract people into the town and its hinterland.  However, Castlerea has not benefited from this development and one of the main reasons is that the sewerage system is inadequate.  Ballintober, a small rural town, cannot take any further development because its sewage is flowing into the Suck, a major fishing river.  It is hard to promote tourism in an area when raw sewage is being pumped into the river from both Castlerea and Ballintober.</P>
      <P>The residents are frustrated and annoyed by the lack of movement on the part of the Department of the Environment and Local Government as it is inhibiting development in the area.  The infuriating point is that it is connected with the greatest squandering of public money by this Government to date, namely, the provision of a sewerage scheme for Castlerea Prison by the Office of Public Works.  If the funds for that scheme were allocated for an integrated scheme with the Castlerea town scheme, along with EU Structural Funds, there would be no net cost to the State.  However, because the Department and the Office of Public Works are not willing to co-ordinate their efforts, the people of Castlerea lose out.</P>
      <P>This is a national scandal.  How can any Minister sit idly by and let money be squandered in such a manner?  If the Government is serious about developing rural Ireland and towns like Castlerea, funds must be immediately provided for this scheme.  It has two parts &mdash; phase one is an upgrade for the existing town scheme, and phase two will extend that scheme to the Williamstown Road area.  The second phase will connect about 40 houses whose occupants are suffering at present &mdash; their septic tanks are not adequate because there is poor soakage leading to a health hazard and a risk of pollution.  The plan has been on the Minister's desk for a number of years and I urge him to approve both phases immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this age of accountability, it is disgraceful that one arm of the State should provide funds for a sewerage scheme for Castlerea Prison when <Col N="107" /> that money could be matched with EU Structural Funds to provide a system for both the prison and the town.  This is mismanagement by Government, the Department and the Office of Public Works.  The scheme would require liaising between the Department and the Office of Public Works and that should happen &mdash; the officials should meet and knock heads together.  I urge the Minister to provide the funds immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this matter.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this item and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I will outline the broader picture in relation to investment in water and sewerage services before I deal with the specific matter raised by the Deputy.  The 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme is by far the largest in the history of the State.  Under the programme, investment in water and sewerage services will amount to almost £185 million in the current year.  This represents an increase of just over 13 per cent on expenditure during 1997, which was £163 million, and a 50 per cent increase on the 1996 figure, which was £122 million.  Funding at such an unprecedented level clearly demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and to meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.</P>
      <P>County Roscommon is benefiting from this substantial level of investment.  The programme covers schemes in Roscommon with an estimated value of approximately £20 million.  These include the Roscommon sewerage scheme which will be substantially completed this year, Boyle sewerage scheme and Ballagh water supply scheme which commenced construction earlier this year, Monksland sewerage scheme, on which work has just started, and Ballaghaderreen sewerage scheme, in respect of which tenders are under consideration by the local authority.  Provision has also been made for the advancement through planning of the north-east Roscommon water augmentation scheme and Tarmonbarry water scheme.  In these circumstances, and taking into account schemes already completed, most recently the Boyle/Ardcarne water supply scheme, I think it can be said that County Roscommon is getting a fair share of the available funding.  These major schemes will greatly contribute towards removing existing development constraints in Roscommon and to providing the necessary infrastructure to support tourism and other economic sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castlerea sewerage scheme was included in an application for EU funding under the Lough Derg catchment protection scheme.  Unfortunately, however, under an economic appraisal <Col N="108" /> required under the terms of the European Community regulations governing the operation of the Cohesion Fund, the Castlerea scheme, and one other scheme, were excluded from funding on cost benefit grounds.  It is worth noting, however, that the Boyle, Monksland and Ballaghaderreen schemes referred to earlier are all benefiting from Cohesion Funding under the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment protection schemes. However, the Castlerea proposal, together with the other projects awaiting approval in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, will be further considered in the context of the water and sewerage services investment programme for 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is a member of the legal profession and will recognise that my question relates to the application of social welfare law in this case.  I require the Minister to examine whether the law was applied in this case and whether the applicant received a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>It is virtually impossible to prove that a person is cohabiting if he or she indicates that cohabitation is not taking place.  On reading through the file I noted that on several occasions the applicant said in response to a question: &ldquo;I am not cohabiting&rdquo;.  Under the current social welfare law, there is no answer to that.  Tricking the applicant into an admission is not acceptable, nor is it legally permissible.</P>
      <P>When this matter went to appeal, the appeal was determined on the basis of information gleaned from an inspection carried out by an inspector.  It was deemed by the inspector that the applicant was lying.  Otherwise there could be no determination other than in favour of the applicant. On one occasion reference was made to the fact that the applicant was cohabiting part-time. There is no such state, and a determination of the case on that basis is unsound.</P>
      <P>I do not object to the application of the law.  If the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs wants to change the law, he should bring his proposals to the House and we will debate them, but the rules cannot be bent to meet a particular situation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister of State, who is an eminent member of the legal profession, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who is an equally eminent member of the legal profession, to examine the file carefully and respond, perhaps at a later stage, with a view to clarifying whether due process has been observed or whether, in this case, a determination of the case was made by virtue of suggesting that circumstances were other than the applicant admitted to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to this case remains as <Col N="109" /> stated in a written reply to a parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy on 30 September last. The person's continuing entitlement to a one parent family payment was determined by a statutorily appointed deciding officer who decided she was not entitled to payment on grounds of cohabitation.  An appeal against this decision was made to the independent social welfare appeals office.  Following two oral hearings of the appeal, an appeals officer upheld the decision that she was not entitled to this payment on grounds of cohabitation.  The appeals officer's decision on the claim is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new evidence or if it is established that a mistake has been made in relation to the law or in relation to the facts. There is nothing to suggest that the decision in this case warrants revision in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister has no function in the adjudication process in relation to entitlements under this or any other statutory social welfare scheme.  Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of an appeal, for appeals officers appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  On the question of disqualification by reason of cohabitation, it is a long established principle of the social welfare code that persons who cohabit are not entitled to lone parent type income support.  This dates back to the 1930s and has been maintained in all subsequent social welfare legislation relating to deserted wives, lone parents and, most recently, with the one parent family payment scheme.  This principle is based on the view that the State is prepared to provide income support for persons who are widowed or who are parents raising a child on their own with limited means.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has argued that a person who is cohabiting on a part-time basis should not be regarded as cohabiting for the purposes of the scheme.  The concept of part-time cohabitation does not exist in social welfare law.  As the Deputy is aware, there are many married couples who are not co-residing fully each week for a wide variety of reasons but who are obviously in a stable relationship with each other.  In the final analysis, the deciding officer, or appeals officer, must form a judgment on whether the circumstances of the case are sufficiently similar to those of a married couple so as to establish that the client concerned and another person are cohabiting as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>The facts in relation to the specific case raised by Deputy Durkan are that the person concerned was receiving a one parent family payment &mdash; formerly lone parent's allowance &mdash; for some years. Following a detailed reinvestigation of her situation, it was decided that she and another person were cohabiting as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>In accordance with natural justice procedures, the Department wrote to the person concerned in December 1997 outlining the evidence available and offering her the opportunity to submit any further information in support of her case prior <Col N="110" /> to any revised decision on her claim.  She declined to respond.  Consequently, a deciding officer decided to revoke her entitlement to one family payment with effect from 29 January 1998 on the grounds that she was cohabiting with another person as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>She exercised her statutory right to appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.  An appeals officer held two oral hearings on her case, in May and July 1998.  The appeals officer subsequently upheld the decision that she was not entitled to one parent family payment on grounds of cohabitation.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is now claiming unemployment assistance.  This latest claim is being investigated by a local officer of the Department and she will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

The great partnership of parents, managers and teachers are together requesting the Minister to respond in a positive way to their assertion that the capitation grant, currently £50 per pupil, is totally inadequate given present day costs, to finance the day-to-day running of their schools, for the provision of heating, lighting, insurance and so on. Their demand, which is reasonable, is for an immediate doubling of the amount from £50 to £100 to partially close the gap that exists between primary and second level capitation grants, a gap which now stands at £127 per pupil.  This differential is unacceptable and unjustified.  The funding of education here is like an inverted pyramid with the greatest amount of funding going to third level education, less to second level education and least of all to primary education.  This a poor foundation for an important and vital stage in a child's education.  The area of greatest need is the area where least resources are being targeted, resulting in obvious areas of neglect.</P>
      <P>Parents have to raise funds to provide basic requirements for their schools.  A £5 per pupil increase in the grant last year was not sufficient to provide paper for infants to scribble on.  Is it right that local parents' groups and teachers must take direct action to support their children's education? This is not what was promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most vulnerable students lose out at primary level and can never regain a place within the ordinary cycle.  Is it any wonder that there are approximately 36,000 pupils with severe reading and learning difficulties and as many more with moderate <Col N="111" /> difficulties?  At least one in three needs remedial teaching and is not receiving it.  The Minister has failed to respond through the appointment of remedial and resource teachers to schools which clearly need them.  No wonder Ireland ranks fourth from the bottom in the OECD with regard to the reading levels of children who have left primary school.  That is some record.</P>
    <P>Is this the priority the Government declared when it came into office?  No additional teachers were appointed to the primary sector since it came to office and its efforts to use the panel system to transfer teachers is an indication of its lack of response to the real needs at primary level.  On several occasions in the past year I have sought the appointment of 27 remedial and resource teachers to schools in need in east Galway.  The Minister's response was to make four appointments, not one of which was an additional appointment.</P>
    <P>Class sizes are deteriorating again.  How can the Minister at a time of buoyant financial and economic progress fail to divert some of these resources into the primary sector?  I seek an immediate response or an indication that, in the forthcoming budget, the Minister will provide for a hundred fold increase in the capitation grant and that remedial and resource facilities will be made available to those in greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in its policy document An Action Programme for the Millenium. The Minister for Education and Science has to consider the best means of deploying resources across the education spectrum to ensure that those resources are allocated to optimum effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister succeeded in securing an increase of £5 in the standard rate of capitation grant payable at primary level for 1998.  This will bring the total standard <i>per capita</i> grant rate to £50 per pupil, or a minimum grant of £3,000 to schools with an enrolment of less than 60 pupils.  This represents an 11.11 per cent increase.  Furthermore, schools which have disadvantaged area status are receiving supplementary capitation payments at a rate of £30 per pupil.  The Minister considers that these figures represent a substantial increase in the level of funding being provided for capitation, especially when set against a background of declining enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister assures the Deputy that the issue of an increase in the capitation grant rate at primary <Col N="112" /> level will be looked at in the context of the Estimates procedures and will form part of the many discussions on educational issues he will have with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in framing the Estimates for 1999.</P>
    <P>School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  Since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.  In effect, therefore, the required local contribution has already fallen well below the traditional 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's call for the elimination of the local contribution, at present officials in the Department are examining the issues involved.  When that review has been completed the Minister will be in a position to decide on any further phasing out of the local contribution requirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister's capacity to allocate additional remedial and resource teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  He recently allocated 60 remedial teacher posts and 26 resource teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998. There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in national schools, of which 59 are in County Galway.  Of the 102 resource posts, 16 are in County Galway.  Unfortunately, the number of schools seeking such posts considerably exceeds the number of posts available for allocation.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not expect another general allocation of remedial or resource teachers to take place during the current school year. However, the needs of schools in County Galway will be fully considered when he is next in a position to make remedial and resource post allocations.</P>
    <P>These measures send a positive signal that the Government is serious in its commitment to give priority to the primary sector in the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 October 1998.<Col N="113" /></P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 was announced in July 1998.  It represents the first formal and comprehensive plan of its kind to be developed in Ireland.  The strategy acknowledges the present unsatisfactory and unacceptable level of road accidents in Ireland.  It sets out specific targets for improving this situation, notably the objective of reducing deaths and serious injuries by at least 20 per cent by 2002.  This target will be achieved by a number of key new initiatives and by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures.  In general, the actions envisaged by the strategy can be mobilised without new legislation, but will need good operational support from the agencies concerned, and in many cases from the public.</P>
      <P>A timetable for key actions has been set out in an appendix to the strategy.  Certain measures will require legislative change, in particular the proposal for a penalty points system which is now being developed by my Department.  In accordance with the strategy, consideration is also being given to the possibility of a legislative amendment to provide for random breath testing on a selective basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>The primary management and enforcement responses to the problem of litter pollution must come from local authorities.  Statistical returns made to my Department by local authorities for the six month period ended June 1998 show that 26 local authorities employed a total of 54 full-time litter wardens.  A further 42 local authorities employed a total fo 137 part-time wardens.  These figures show a significant improvement on the total of 138 wardens &mdash; both full and part-time &mdash; employed at the end of last year.  In addition, local authorities have stepped up their enforcement of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997 &mdash; the statistics for the first six months of this year are now available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that local authorities are beginning to use their flexible and extensive powers under the 1997 Act to combat litter, there is a continuing need for more responsible action on the part of the public and more rigorous enforcement of the law by the local authorities.  To this end, I announced, in June this year, a series of measures to combat the country's continuing litter pollution problem.  These measures will support the strengthened local authority action on litter.</P>
      <P>In relation to litter management plans, under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, local authorities are not obliged to submit a copy of their plans to my Department; however, 65 local authorities have forwarded a copy for information purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also responsible both in so far as activities licensable by the Agency are concerned and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes and the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment.  The EPA report for 1991-94 indicates that the bulk of Irish surface waters are of good quality.  The report draws attention, however, to a growing tendency towards eutrophication, that is, the enrichment of waters beyond natural levels by nutrients, mainly phosphorous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Studies by the EPA and Teagasc in relation to Lough Derg indicate that the lake is eutrophic. <Col N="117" /> The EPA expects to publish an updated report this year in relation to surface waters.</P>
    <P>The relevant local authorities are involved in a Catchment Management Programme for Lough Derg which aims, <i>inter alia,</i> to upgrade sewerage collection and treatment systems and has established a monitoring and management system for the catchment.  An application has been made for EU Cohesion Fund assistance for investment of £73 million in respect of 47 separate projects in the Lough Derg catchment.  The investment programme will be developed over a number of states.  Cohesion Funding of £19.9 million has been secured already in relation to ten projects in phase 1.</P>
    <P>The monitoring and management system involves participation by a wide range of interested parties including local authorities, State and semi-State agencies and fisheries boards together with farming, industrial and angling interests.  This initiative provides a mechanism to implement, in relation to Lough Derg, the catchment-based, national strategy to address eutrophication which was published by my Department in May 1997.  The strategy document &ldquo;Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes&rdquo; is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It sets out a systematic approach to tackle the problem of eutrophication caused by phosphorous inputs to rivers and lakes and incorporates a range of measures to protect and, where possible, restore water quality.  Some of the main thrusts of the strategy address the issue of water pollution from farming activities, and discharges by local authorities and by industry.  As part of the ongoing implementation of this strategy, I made Regulations last July prescribing statutory standards for phosphorous in rivers and lakes.  My Department issued guidelines in August for nutrient management planning on farms.  The development of a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association, to reduce the amount of phosphorous in household detergents is also at an advanced stage.  I am committed to the full implementation of all the measures for which I am responsible in the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 report on the State of the Environment in Ireland, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, estimates that the total water produced by public water supply schemes is about 284 million gallons per day.  An additional 11 million gallons per day <Col N="118" /> is provided by group schemes.  Some 130,000 households have their own individual supplies. The report estimates that domestic water requirements amount to approximately 55 gallons of water per person per day which would give total potential domestic usage of some 200 million gallons a day and usage by manufacturing industry is estimated at 53 million gallons a day.  The remaining water produced would be accounted for mainly by commercial and agricultural users. The Agency's 1996 report on the Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland contains information in relation to the daily usage for most of the public drinking water supplies monitored.</P>
      <P>Substantial investment has been made over the period of the current national development plan to upgrade and extend public and private water supplies.  Since the start of 1994, capital expenditure on public and group water supplies has exceeded £270 million.  This investment has facilitated the provision of an additional 35 million gallons of treated water in public water supplies between the start of 1994 and the end of last year.</P>
      <P>National aggregate figures for water supply are not of great use for the purposes of planning investment, as this must be done by reference to the supply and demand position in each of the many areas covered by separate existing supply systems.  Major studies have already been carried out into the water supply position and future requirements, including the demand from domestic, industrial, commercial and other users, in a number of areas including the Dublin region, and Galway and Waterford cities.  Similar studies in Cork and Limerick and a national water study, all currently under way, will provide the same information for the 120 or so remaining medium to large water supplies.  All of these studies are expected to be completed by the end of next year.</P>

      <P>Under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997 and through recycling initiatives including the operation of REPAK, substantial ongoing efforts are being made to reduce packaging disposal to landfill. The policy of reduced reliance on landfill, outlined in the recently published Statement on Waste Management &mdash; Changing Our Ways &mdash;<Col N="119" /> involves amongst other things, a targeted 65 per cent reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill and the diversion of 50 per cent of household waste from landfill.</P>
      <P>While my attention was not drawn to the specific instance raised, I recently amended the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997 to provide that a person may not supply packaging or packaged products to the Irish market unless the packaging concerned complies with specified essential requirements as to its nature and composition. These requirements, which were laid down in Annex 11 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994, are intended to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment and facilitate its recovery.  The new regulations will come into operation on 1 December 1998.  I am now arranging that they are brought to the attention of the company concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The latest comprehensive information available to my Department on house prices is contained in My Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin for the June quarter, 1998, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The price levels reflected in the June quarter figures would, generally speaking, have been determined before any effects from the implementation of the Action on House Prices which was announced by the Government at the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still too early for a detailed assessment of the effects of the measures adopted by the Government and indeed, the full effect of some measures will only be seen in the medium term, particularly those designed to promote housing supply.  However, the evidence available indicates that the measures already in place are, in fact, having a positive effect: there are indications from lending agencies and market sources of an <Col N="120" /> easing of the house prices situation, first time purchasers reclaiming the market which had been increasingly dominated by investors, more second hand houses on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions, fewer properties exceeding their asking price and a general calming of future price expectations.  I would hope to see these trends reflected in the official figures for the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the Government's Action on House Prices is a priority for my Department in order to ensure that all of the measures have maximum effect as quickly as possible.  In particular, measures to secure continued increase in the supply of housing will be a key factor.  Considerable progress is already being made in this regard.  The record level of housing output in 1997 is expected to be surpassed again this year, with completions likely to exceed 40,000.  These upward trends in housing output will be boosted by the effect of the measures in Action on House Prices in particular, the significant additional Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure specifically to open up extra land for housing.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities have been advised to promote higher residential densities at appropriate locations and arrangements are proceeding for the development of planning guidelines in this regard.  The reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for the next four years, to encourage faster sales of land with planning permission for housing, is also helping to increase the supply of land for housing in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I believe that the elements of the Government's Action on House Prices that are particularly designed to assist first time house buyers such as the major reductions in stamp duty, removal of investor competition, increased supply of housing and improvement to the local authority shared ownership scheme, will be seen to have increasing beneficial effect in Dublin and elsewhere in the period ahead.  My Department will be monitoring developments carefully in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12.  A number of measures are currently in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in detail in Ireland's Second</P>
      <P>National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia</i>, address climate change.</P>
      <P>As part of the development of a National Strategy to meet our Kyoto commitment, a consultancy study on the &ldquo;Limitation and Reduction of CO 2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland&rdquo; was published in June 1998, and submissions were invited from interested bodies, individuals and organisations.  Copies of the Second National Communication and the consultancy study are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Public Enterprise will hold consultative forum on 28 October 1998 for those who have made submissions on the consultancy study.  Following this, I will complete the preparation of the national strategy, for Government approval; this will put in place a framework for achieving our Kyoto commitment, building upon existing measures and developing additional policies and measures for implementation in all sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Achievement of the objectives and targets set out in the recent policy statement on waste management will require the participation of Government, local authorities, business and the community at large.  However, having regard to their key role in the delivery of waste services and their statutory powers and responsibilities in relation to waste management generally, local authorities have a crucial role in delivering change in waste management practice and performance.  Accordingly, the policy statement is addressed chiefly to them and outlines policy requirements and objectives which should be taken into account in the waste management planning exercises currently under way.  Regional and local waste management plans will provide the strategic framework for change, in particular identify measures which will be undertaken by local authorities to secure the provision of an integrated waste infrastructure giving practical expression to the requirements of the waste hierarchy.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the policy statement, implementation to achieve clearly stated national objectives will involve: meaningful long-term planning by local authorities, on a regionalised basis; a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of waste treatment options; deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets; greater participation by the private sector in the provision of waste management services; a more effective and equitable system of waste charging which incentivises waste minimisation and recovery; greater utilisation of legislative instruments extending the scope of producer responsibility initiatives, and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 75, 113 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has recently published a Transportation Review and Short-Term Action Plan in order to respond to the greater than anticipated growth in traffic in the Dublin area and the need to prioritise short-term action in advance of the completion of the major DTI infrastructural projects.</P>
      <P>The action plan is designed to accelerate the implementation of those elements of the DTI Strategy which can be completed in the period up to 2000.  Accordingly, it focuses on public transport enhancement, traffic management, parking policy and the provision of cycling facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government has already endorsed early implementation of most of the proposed measures detailed in the action plan.  Additional funding totalling £91 million was approved by Government earlier this year, as part of the real-location of EU aid for the Luas project, to finance the accelerated provision of quality bus corridors and cycle facilities; 50 new buses; 20 new diesel rail cars; new car sets for the DART; lengthening of DART platforms; and upgrading of other suburban rail lines.  This funding will be required in 1999 and 2000 and will be provided for in the published Estimates for 1999 and subsequent years.  Having regard to the need to plan the necessary work, I do not anticipate that a Supplementary Estimate will be required in 1998 in respect of expenditure falling to be met from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>The action plan also includes measures requiring the provision of further funding for the purchase of 100 additional buses, to support enhanced bus and rail services, and for the Garda Traffic Division.  These will be considered by Government in the context of the 1999 Estimates and budget.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measures set out in the action plan, work is continuing on the major infrastructural projects provided for in the DTI Strategy, including completion of the remaining elements of the Dublin C-ring.  DTO has also initiated a fundamental review of the DTI Strategy for completion in 1999.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House in response to Questions Nos. 546, 550, 551 and 555 on 30 September 1998, I was pleased to be in a position to sign, on behalf of Ireland, the United Nations Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters at Aarhus in June of this year.  My Department's detailed examination of the terms and implications of ratification of the Convention, including issues such as the making available of emissions data, will of necessity take some time.  This is partly because the examination will also cover the relationship of our prospective obligations under the Convention with the existing statutory provisions on access to information on the environment and the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  I intend to ensure that Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Convention, and meet all its requirements in full, as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>At the European Council of Environment Ministers, I have welcomed the Commissions's proposal to update this Directive, in the light of experience to date on the marketing of products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  In doing so, I have pointed to an increasing level of public awareness and interest in the delibrate release of GMOs to the environment. Against this background, I have emphasised the need for the Community to be firm in its determination not to compromise on the fundamental objective of protecting human health and the environment.</P>
      <P>The EU must work towards achieving a balanced, fair and workable amendment which will ensure essential safeguards on the operation of the Community's biotechnology sector.  In particular, the amendment proposal is an opportunity to introduce greater transparency into the provisions of the Directive, particularly in relation to the labelling of genetically modified products to be marketed openly within the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of five professional town planners are employed by my Department; two of these are currently serving as members of An Bord Pleanála on a tempary basis.  In addition, one town planner from Dublin Corporation is currently on secondment to my Department.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my response to Question Nos. 56, 79 and 86 on 3 February 1998, a number of factors are relevant in relation to the provision of open space in housing schemes.  Local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government Act, 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes.  The criteria to be applied to the provision of public open space in housing schemes is a matter for each local authority in accordance with their development plan.  When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is engaging consultants to prepare draft planning guidelines on residential density. As the subject matter of the Question is of some relevance in this context, I am arranging to have a copy of the Question referred to the consultant.<Col N="133" /></P>
    <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, amenity areas, etc.  specifically in local authority housing schemes is also a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Appropriate limited facilities of this kind are funded as part of the cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations.  Local authorities have been advised, in guidelines issued by the Department, that new housing should comprise small, well-designed schemes, be integrated as far as possible with housing and other developments in the area, create a good living environment for the residents and be convenient to various services and amenities.</P>
    <P>Funding is available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated rundown housing estates.  The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but also to improve the living conditions of the tenants.  For this reason, works of an environmental nature, including limited amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken to the dwellings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to introduce car testing as early as practicable.  Testing will be carried out at dedicated <Col N="134" /> test centres under the control of a contractor to be appointed on a national basis on foot of an EU-wide competitive tendering process.  Following a qualification stage five consortia were invited on 7 July last to submit detailed tenders by the closing date of 25 September.  My Department is now evaluating the tenders received with a view to selecting the contractor as soon as possible. The precise detail of start-up arrangements, including the commencement date for testing, will depend on the particular proposals of the selected contractor, including the ability to mobilise promptly the network of test centres and other resources.</P>
    <P>The car test parameters will be those required under Directive 96/96 EC which obliges all member states to introduce such tests.  They cover braking systems, steering, visibility, lamps and electrical equipment, axles, wheels and suspensions, chassis and attachments, bodywork, safety belts, warning devices, speedometer, noise and certain air pollutant emissions.  The air pollutant tests involve gauging emissions of smoke from diesel engines and both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from petrol engines.  There are no proposals at present to include nitrogen oxides in the test regime.</P>
    <P>Methods of testing and the reasons for failure will be documented in the car tester's manual to be published by my Department.  A draft of the manual has been the subject of consultation with interests which included the motor industry, motoring associations, industrial and farming groups and engineering institutions; the finalised manual will reflect the outcome of that consultation process.</P>

      <P>The Secretary General and other senior officers of my Department recently met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and are available to brief the committee, as required on an ongoing basis.  Such meetings provide the appropriate context in which to inform the committee of national and international developments in areas for which I am responsible and to address matters raised by the committee itself. A report was also submitted to the committee in respect of the ministerial conference on the environment for Europe process held in Aarhus in June 1998.  I am satisfied that current arrangements work well and I am not aware that the committee is uninformed on any matters which are of concern to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Action has already been taken by the Government in response to increased demand for housing, both in the overall context and in relation to social housing.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive package of measures announced in the Government's Action on House Prices published on 23 April last involves a three pronged approach to increase the potential supply of housing, address factors causing overheating or distortions in the market, and improve the position of prospective first-time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to assist first-time buyers form a key element of the package including: an increase in the income limits for the local authority shared ownership scheme; removal of fiscal incentives to investors who were pricing low income buyers out of the market; significant reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower price levels, and measures to boost housing supply such as special <Col N="137" /> additional Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure to open up substantial extra land for housing, promotion of increased densities at appropriate locations, and a temporary reduction of capital gains tax on disposal of serviced land to encourage faster release for residential development.</P>
    <P>The full effect of some of the measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, will only be seen in the medium term.  However, positive effects have already been reported by market sources, including signs of some easing of the house prices situation, first-time buyers reclaiming the starter home market, which had been increasingly dominated by investors, and an increase in the number of second hand houses coming on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the position of those households who rely on social housing to meet their housing needs, substantially increased resources were devoted to these programmes in 1998 in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary bodies.  I expect that the social housing measures, including newly provided local authority and voluntary housing, vacancies in the existing local authority housing stock, shared ownership etc.  will meet the needs of up to 10,000 households this year, compared to under 9,300 households in 1997.  I am seeking further increases in resources for social housing in the coming year, in advance of the results of the statutory assessment of the need for local authority housing which will be undertaken next March.</P>
    <P>Overall housing output continues to respond well to demand and in 1998 will be in the order of 40,000 completions.  This will exceed last year's record level and the trend should be reinforced significantly as the measures taken by the Government to boost housing supply begin to be reflected in terms of output.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for road construction and improvement including the provision of cycle facilities rests with local authorities and in the case of national roads the National Roads Authority.  My Department has sought to encourage the road authorities concerned to make appropriate provision for cyclists in constructing and improving roads. This has been done, <i>inter alia</i>, through: the Memorandum <Col N="138" /> on Grants for Non-National Roads 1996-99 which requires that consideration should be given by local authorities to the provision of facilities for cyclists where such is warranted on existing roads in urban areas and in the development of new road schemes; and the development of a manual for use by local authorities and NRA on the provision of cycling facilities, including segregation of cycle and motorised traffic.  Provision of Cycle Facilities: National Manual for Urban Areas was published on behalf of my Department by the Dublin Transportation Office in 1997 and a copy is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to rent subsidies paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme operated by the health boards under the aegis of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I understand that expenditure in 1997 on these subsidies amounted to £75.3 million.  While the average cost nationally of providing a local authority dwelling in 1997 was £57,200, the payment of rent subsidies is concentrated in urban areas and particularly Dublin where the cost of providing local authority housing is considerably higher than the national average.  An estimated 42,000 households were assisted with SWA rent subsidies at any particular time in 1997 and about 1,000 local authority houses could, having regard to location have been provided for the amount expended on rent supplementation in 1997.  The total number of different households who received rent supplementation at some time during 1997 would, in fact, have been higher than 42,000 because of the high turnover of households entering and leaving the scheme.  Precise figures in this regard are not available.</P>

      <P>The strategy affirms that there is scope for considerable reduction of many vehicle speeds on Irish roads given the scale of speed limit excedances being recorded by the National Roads Authority.  Measures to counter speeding have therefore been prioritised by the strategy and should contribute some 29 per cent of the total life savings targeted.  These measures include the extension of the use by the gardaí of automatic speed detection devices &mdash; both fixed and mobile, greater use of traffic calming measures and the continuation of awareness campaigns by the National Safety Council on the risks of excessive and inappropriate speeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to prices generally is to encourage competition and to promote greater price awareness among consumers.  The Oireachtas enacted laws on competition in 1991 and 1996 in line with this approach.  In the absence of official information since the removal of statutory price control on petrol prices in 1991, I am not in a position to comment on price differentials arising between different retail outlets beyond indicating that there are a range of factors that contribute to the final price, including product and other costs and profit margins taken by <Col N="144" /> the various economic operators.  Ultimately, motorists need to be sensitive to prices charged in order to make the market work effectively. Should the Deputy be concerned about anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing or the abuse of a dominant position, our competition law provides alternative ways of pursuing such allegations.  A civil action can be taken under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or a complaint can be lodged with the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate the alleged offence(s).  The Director of Competition Enforcement is based at the offices of the Competition Authority, Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>Current rules for the labelling of food and beverages are set down in the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 1982-1997 implementing EC Directives in this area.  Over the years, the EU Commission has not found sufficient support among the member states for proposed amendments making it mandatory to display a list of ingredients for alcoholic beverages.  In February 1997, the Commission presented a draft Directive to Council and the European Parliament dealing exclusively with the issue of alcohol ingredient listing.  The opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal is still awaited.  Ireland has consistently supported the Commission's previous efforts in this area and, subject to the necessary examination of the details I will be urging our EU partners to support the Commission's proposal when it is considered in the Council.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in the light of the significant and positive changes in the labour market since inception of the community employment programme (CE) in 1994 the Government commissioned consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to carry out an independent review of the programme.

    <P>On foot of their review Deloitte &amp; Touche propose a package of measures dealing <i>inter alia</i> with: the quality of CE for participants; its optimal <Col N="145" /> size in current labour market conditions; and the appropriateness of CE for younger persons (under 25s) <i>vis-à-vis</i> other labour market programmes. There has been a great deal of interest in the review of CE by the various stakeholders in the programme.  For that reason immediately on receipt of the review I arranged for its publication, laying before the Oireachtas and circulation to the social partners to allow for a process of consultation on the recommendations in the review.  In due course proposals I make to Government to amend the programme will reflect that process of consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is aware of the threat to depleting natural resources through deforestation.  An ambitious afforestation programme is the major platform of the Government's forest strategy, Growing for the Future. This coupled with ongoing reforestation programmes has resulted in Ireland's forest cover being expanded.  It is envisaged that afforestation cover will increase from the present relatively low level of 8 per cent of the land area to 17 per cent by the year 2035.</P>
      <P>The afforestation grant and forest premium schemes, introduced under EU Council Regulation 2080/92 support this programme including the afforestation of agricultural land.  This programme embraces a wide variety of species and includes both increased planting levels of broad-leaves and diverse species of conifers.</P>
      <P>The high level of planting is making a contribution to offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by creating new carbon sinks.  Our planting since 1990 will be a single national contribution under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recently published report by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) on the state of the natural world.  The report, which was prepared by WWF in conjunction with the New Economics Foundation and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, presents the Living Planet Index, which analyses the deterioration of the world's ecosystems between 1970 and 1995.  I am naturally concerned at the report's conclusions about the state of the natural world. I have taken particular note of its comments on the state of freshwater and marine ecosystems, and I have asked my officials to examine the report and consider its implications for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am committed to the protection and preservation of our marine and freshwater environments.  Central to this strategy is the protection of the overall marine ecosystem and the maintenance of the highest standards in the quality of our marine waters.  This must be achieved through a blend of strong legislative control, comprehensive research and the provision of a solid infrastructure to deal with potential emergencies.  Since I became Minister last year I have put in place a number of important measures to deal with the prevention of pollution around our coasts, the provision of a rapid response to pollution incidents so as to minimise damage, and the improvement of compensation arrangements where pollution incidents take place.  I will shortly be bringing forward new proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>I recognise that effective action at international level is an essential part of any strategy to protect the earth's resources.  Accordingly I was pleased to lead the Irish delegation to the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission in Portugal this summer.  The Commission adopted an important new Annex to the OSPAR Convention to deal with the conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area.  The Commission also adopted important strategies dealing not only with ecosystems and biological diversity but also radioactive substances, hazardous substances, and eutrophication, and agreed a number of important decisions and recommendations, most notably in relation to the disposal of disused offshore installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, work is currently under way on the preparation of an environmental <Col N="148" /> Quality Status Report (QSR) for the entire area covered by the OSPAR Convention.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of the area known as the Celtic Seas, which includes all of Ireland's marine and coastal areas.  In conjunction with similar reports on the four other parts of the OSPAR region, the Celtic Seas QSR will be assimilated into a Convention-wide QSR that will be published in the year 2000.  This report will provide an important basis for future decisions on the protection of our marine resources.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to work closely with my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to address the issues raised in the WWF report.</P>

In this regard, I have asked the Secretary General of the Department to pursue consultations with all concerned, including the relevant staff associations.

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a duty officer on call outside normal office hours to deal with matters requiring immediate attention.  Duty officers are frequently asked to issue passports in situations of urgency or in emergencies.</P>
      <P>The guidelines under which they operate are that passports should normally be issued only when they are satisfied that the person concerned wants a passport for reasons of (1) genuine and substantial distress such as the death or funeral of a relative or a relative dying abroad, (2) urgent business abroad, particularly where Ireland is a beneficiary, or (3) marriage abroad or a couple going on a honeymoon when one of them finds a passport to have been lost or mislaid.</P>
      <P>Duty officers frequently receive requests which fall outside these categories, such as from people departing on holidays abroad who have mislaid their passports or find that they are out of date. Duty officers are not obliged to issue a passport in such cases.  However, they may do so at their discretion, depending on their assessment of the individual circumstances and the time pressure arising from their priority duties.  It will be appreciated that, in addition to passport matters, duty officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs are required to attend to a wide range of the Department's business outside of normal working hours.</P>
      <P>The validity of passports issued by duty officers is normally limited to the duration of the trip in connection with which the application is made. The holder may subsequently apply for a replacement passport of full validity.</P>
      <P>In the period 1 January to 2 October 1998 duty officers issued 567 passports outside normal office hours.</P>

      <P>No such meetings took place in 1994, however in 1998 a number of meetings were held between officials of my Department and the office of the Tánaiste as part of the consultative process in preparation for the Government deliberations in relation to the Dublin light rail project.  I suggested that the discussions consider the option of an underground section in the city centre.  The person in question accompanied an official from the office of the Tánaiste to some of these meetings. That person did not receive any remuneration from my Department in relation to his attendance at these meetings.  I am very happy at the range, scope, participative nature and outcome of these discussions.</P>
      <P>In the context of preparing responses to the commitments which will arise under the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, and conscious of the important implications of those commitments for the power generation sector, the ESB undertook work for my Department in early 1998 in connection with energy forecasts and environmental implications arising from the important and dominant position of the ESB in the provision of energy in the State.  The person named was one of the ESB personnel involved in developing these forecasts.  This was a voluntary arrangement and no renumeration was involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future role of peat in electricity generation in Ireland was examined by a group &mdash; the Peat Review Group &mdash; established in August, 1993.  The group comprised representatives of the Department, ESB and Bord na Móna.  The group reported in February 1995.  The optimum scenario identified in the report, which was accepted by the boards of ESB and Bord na Móna, comprised: (1) the closure of a number of the older inefficient units in the existing stations; (2) a refurbishment programme by ESB in other plant and the development of the new 120MW peat station in the east midlands.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment programme for the existing stations coupled with the commissioning of the new 120MW station represents a long-term strategic approach to ensure the continued use of peat in electricity generation.  It also maximises long-term employment in peat production and electricity generation in the midlands.</P>
      <P>The ESB currently consumes approximately 3 million tonnes of milled peat for electricity generation. This is expected to rise to around 3.9 million tonnes for a short period in the early years of the next decade when the new 120MW peat plant at Edenderry comes on stream, falling back thereafter to around 2.7 million tonnes by 2005 and to 2.2 million tonnes by 2010 as existing older peat generating units are retired.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, the volume of peat used in electricity generation is expected to decline progressively to around 1.3 million tonnes by 2023.</P>
      <P>This overall progressive reduction in peat consumption tonnages was reflected in a memorandum of understanding between the Minister and the EU Commission in relation to the EU grant for the new peat fired power station.  The Commission had been concerned that the new station might lead to an increase in CO 2 emissions from the peat sector.</P>

      <P>Where bilateral air services agreements are concluded between two countries, provisions on traffic rights at intermediate points in third countries &mdash; so called fifth freedom rights &mdash; are a normal feature.  These rights are naturally subject in the first instance to the approval of the third countries involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that under the existing UK-US bilateral air services agreement, the US has conceded to the UK rights for UK airlines to carry traffic between some third countries, including Ireland, and the US.  As I have said, the use of such rights, in the case of Irish traffic, is subject to the approval of the Irish authorities.  In this regard I can advise the Deputy that, under the <Col N="156" /> Ireland-UK bilateral Air Services Agreement, UK airlines are entitled to such rights to the US and Canada only at Shannon.</P>
    <P>My Department has not carried out any general analysis of the impact on Aer Lingus of possible additional competition in the transatlantic market should UK airlines seek to take up these rights at Shannon.  The rights have been available to UK airlines for a number of years without being taken up.</P>
    <P>As regards a possible strategic alliance for Aer Lingus, I have asked the company to report back to me in due course on its efforts to secure such an alliance.  It is only when I receive this report that any realistic assessment of the potential impact and implications of such an alliance can be made.</P>
    <P>As regard a possible EU/US &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; deal, I can inform the Deputy that the existing mandate for negotiations by the Commission does not extend to market access issues.  Agreement on extending that mandate to include market access has not been reached in the Transport Council of Ministers, where I have indicated my opposition to such an extension of the mandate on several occasions, the last being 1 October 1998.</P>

      <P>When undertaking new investments, it is a matter for the State companies themselves to make appropriate arrangements for incorporating accessibility features in new designs.</P>
      <P>The CIE companies, in particular, are fully aware of my desire that transport providers maximise the accessibility and user-friendliness of their facilities. A transport accessibility committee meets on a regular basis.

This committee provides the CIE companies with the opportunity to report regularly to my Department on progress in making their services and facilities more accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has a disability liaison officer located at Dublin Airport and the National Rehabilitation Board carries out regular accessibility audits at State airports.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The ongoing need for apprentices will be reviewed regularly and apprentices will continue to be recruited as required.  Both the number and type of apprentices recruited are determined by the Defence Forces requirement for particular skills.  It is intended that, in future, apprentices will be trained externally and only very specialised apprentice training will take place within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There have been initial discussions with Kildare VEC, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Department of Education and Science regarding the transfer of the civilian apprentice teachers to the Curragh to complete the training of the current group of apprentices.</P>
      <P>Personnel attached to the Army Apprentice School have been re-located from Devoy Barracks, Naas to the Curragh Camp and equipment and machinery belonging to the school will also be transferred to the latter location. Arrangements are being made to upgrade a number of existing buildings at the Curragh Camp at an estimated cost of £230,000.  The works are expected to be completed early next year and while initially they will permit the completion of training of the apprentices re-located from Devoy Barracks in the longer term the facilities will be used for general technical training in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Some discussions were held with the Department of Education and Science regarding the possible use of Devoy Barracks for apprentice training by that Department but I understand that it was not considered to be a feasible option.  To date no application has been received from that Department seeking land at Devoy Barracks for any other form of educational institution.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to offer Devoy Barracks for sale by public tender as soon as possible.  I would propose to meet with Naas Urban District Council to discuss the situation in regard to the sale, including the question of zoning, at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the new Defence Forces headquarters came into operation on 1 October 1998 and work is being expedited in carrying out the other major changes due under the re-organisation programme including the amalgamation of infantry battalions.</P>
      <P>Under the reorganisation plan, the 3rd Infantry Battalion which is stationed in the Curragh and the 30th Infantry Battalion which is stationed in Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny, are being amalgamated. The headquarters of the amalgamated battalion will be located in Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 191, 197 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of plants to EU export status has considerable resource implications for my Department, given the increased demand created as a result for veterinary supervision in the plants in question.  While my Department is conscious of the desire on the part of upgraded plants to begin to operate to export standard, once they are technically approved to do so, this can only be done when the Department is in a position to provide the necessary level of Department supervision.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made, and will continue to be made, to limit the delay between approval and the provision of Department staff to allow the plant operate to export standards.  The reality is that given both the capping of recruitment which applies to all Departments, and the ever increasing work in relation to animal and public health, the allocation of resources to specific areas of work, of necessity, leads to cutting back in others. I am keeping the staff situation under review and I can assure the Deputies that existing resources will be used to best effect to meet the needs of the industry.  The provision of veterinary supervisory staff for the specific plant referred to is being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme of early retirement from farming that an application is not valid until all the required documentation is supplied and the date from which the payment of the pension may be made is the date of receipt of a valid application.  In this case, an application was received on 17 September 1997 in the local farm development office but the documentation was found to be incomplete and it was referred back to the applicant to furnish the missing documentation.

    <P>In line with special provisions which I have put in place to ensure that retiring farmers are not penalised for any delays by my Department in processing applications, the date of valid application in this case was backdated to 2 January 1998 and the pension has been paid from that date.  However, my Department cannot accept responsibility for the quite considerable delay by <Col N="163" /> the applicant in providing the required material. In the circumstances, the date of commencement of the pension in this case cannot be further backdated to 17 September 1997.</P>

      <P>In accordance with national legislation (Statutory Instrument 103 of 1996) and Council Regulation (EC) 820/97, cattle must be identified by means of two plastic ear tags, each containing the same unique tag number, whenever they are moved from a holding whether to another holding, a mart or a meat plant.  An animal bearing only one plastic ear tag is not legally identified and cannot be allowed to move.  Experience has shown that where animals are correctly and securely tagged, tag loss in transit is low.  There is no derogation from the double tag requirement provided for in the Council regulation or in the national legislation.</P>

The occupation of land for the purpose of pig production, including intensive pig production, is considered to be farming for the purpose of income tax.  Individual full-time farmers engaged in pig production are, therefore, able to avail of income averaging provided all the provisions of section 657 of the Taxes Consolidation Act are complied with. Companies engaged in pig production, however, cannot avail of income averaging because section 657 provides for full-time individual farmers only.

      <P>The medical criteria for the reliefs are specified in the regulations.  The reliefs are targeted at those persons who are permanently and severely disabled with regard to physical mobility.  The question of eligibility in each case is determined under the procedures set out in the regulations. The granting of a primary medical certificate is a matter of judgment on the part of the director of community care and medical officer of health in the local health board.  If such a certificate is refused, the matter may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.  Given the cost of the reliefs, it is appropriate that these should be focused on the most severe cases rather than applied generally to all forms of disability.</P>

      <P>Irish banks are required to adhere to limits with regard to their exposures to counterparties.  The requirement for limiting exposures are set out in the Central Bank of Ireland's notice concerning the implementation of the EU directive on the monitoring <Col N="176" /> and control of large exposures of credit institutions.  Banks are required to limit their exposures to a single or connected counter-party to 25 per cent of their own funds.  In effect, this means that a bank with own funds of £100 million could only have an exposure, both on and off balance sheet, of £25 million to a single counterparty.  The Central Bank of Ireland monitors adherence to this requirement and in times of uncertainty, as was the case with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), increases its level of surveillance.  I am informed by the Central Bank that there are no exposures of any significance by Irish banks to LTCM.</P>

      <P>Under EU Commission regulations on state aid all selective or regional business tax incentives must have the Commission's approval prior to their introduction. However, no such EU constraint arises in connection with the residential tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme and for this reason I introduced the residential tax incentives with effect from 1 June 1998.</P>
      <P>There have been problems in obtaining the necessary EU Commission approval for the business tax incentives despite the fact that they were discussed with the EU Commission in Brussels at meetings in February, May and July 1998.  The two business tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme are the capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of industrial and commercial buildings and the double rent relief for the lessees of such buildings.  These same two relics were the subject of formal notification sent to the EU Commission at end January 1998 in connection with an extension to the Custom House Docks area in Dublin.  I decided that it would be advisable to wait until these two reliefs were processed by the EU Commission for the Custom House Docks area before formally notifying them again to the Commission for the rural renewal scheme given that the reliefs were the same in both cases.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the views of the Commission in regard to the first scheme should clearly be of assistance in framing the subsequent formal notification for the rural renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>However, as the Commission had not yet approved the Custom House Docks scheme by mid-September I decided that the Commission should be formally notified immediately of the rural renewal scheme.  The formal notification was made on 17 September, although as I have said the Commission has had actual knowledge of this scheme for some time arising from my Department's representations to it in the matter. The timescale for dealing with the application is a matter for the EU Commission and every effort will be made to assist the Commission in processing the application as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that relevant contracts tax (RCT) applies to payments made by principal contractors to self-employed subcontractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing industries.  Unless the subcontractor is a C2 holder in respect of whom the principal <Col N="178" /> contractor has received a relevant payments card, principal contractors are obliged to deduct tax at 35 per cent from payments to subcontractors in these industries and to give the subcontractor a form RCT DC (formerly a C45), which is a certificate of deduction.</P>
      <P>RCT does not apply to payments between an employer and employee; such payments are within the PAYE system.  Where an employer fails to deduct income tax, PRSI and levies under PAYE in respect of such payments, the employer is liable for the tax etc.  which he should have deducted from such payments.  The employer is also liable to account for the employer's portion of PRSI on such payments.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commisioners that where any cases come to light of payments to employees being categorised as payments to self-employed subcontractors, the tax etc.  which should have been deducted is charged on the employer in question.  As part of its ongoing audit programme, Revenue examines whether the correct deductions have been made from various payments.  Similarly, I am informed that the commissioners make every effort to ensure that RCT is not applied to payments which should correctly be classified as employer-employee payments.</P>
      <P>The nature of the relationship between the person making payments and the recipient is a question which can only be decided by an examination of all the relevant facts.  Neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners can dictate to the parties to a contract what the nature of that contract should be.  To the extent that the contract is one of self-employment, RCT applies to payments made under that contract.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners regard RCT as a valuable tool in ensuring that the correct tax is paid in respect of certain contracts of self-employment and there is no policy to reduce its use.  In fact, the Finance Act, 1998 extended the application of RCT in the meat-processing industry.</P>

      <P>Allocations of national lottery funding are decided by the Government as part of the annual Estimates process.  The 1998 allocations, amounting to a total of more than £120 million, are summarised in an appendix to the Revised Estimates for Public Services.  The allocations are in accordance with section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986 which sets out the categories for which lottery funding may be provided, namely sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language), the arts and the health of the community. <Col N="181" /> Additional purposes approved by Government under the 1986 Act include youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.</P>
      <P>While I as Minister for Finance have overall responsibility for the operation of the national lottery, once the lottery allocations have been approved by Government the responsibility for the disbursement of grants rests with the relevant spending Minister.</P>
      <P>Lottery funded expenditure is administered by a number of Departments and related agencies and covers a wide range of programmes and schemes.  Details of lottery funded expenditure for 1997 are contained in volume 2 of the 1997 appropriation accounts, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  There is also the &ldquo;Compendium of National Lottery Grants&rdquo;, which is published by the Department of Finance and brings together in one volume details of all lottery spending.  The last compendium covered the years 1995 to 1996.  This document provides very detailed information and gives a comprehensive picture of the allocation of lottery funds. Similar information for 1997, based on the appropriation accounts for that year, will be published in the coming months.</P>
      <P>In relation to schemes administered by my Department, the monthly funding for the past 12 months are as follows:</P>

      <P>Membership of EMU, irrespective of the UK's attitude to participation, will be of benefit to Ireland, a <Col N="182" /> conclusion which has been reached by both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council in independent reports.  EMU will bring the elimination of some transaction costs, the elimination of exchange rate risk across the euro area, lower and uniform interest rates and generally easier access to a huge market.  Participation in EMU will also add to our attractiveness for foreign direct investment as potential investors seek to gain a foot-hold in the euro area.</P>
      <P>However, while EMU will open up huge opportunities, it will also bring increased levels of competition.  It is imperative that companies, in Border counties and elsewhere, focus on the opportunities while at the same time addressing any weaknesses which might make them vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Firms in the Border counties have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, a competitive advantage over Northern Irish businesses in the recent part due to the relative strength of sterling.  This offers an opportunity for such firms to improve their competitiveness and so improve their capacity to deal with any shocks that might emerge in the future.</P>
      <P>Sustaining this competitive success in EMU is a major priority for the Government.  In May 1997, the Government established the National Competitiveness Council to provide a basis for developing appropriate Government action aimed at ensuring that the overall environment for investment by the traded goods and services sector in Ireland is more favourable than it is in other countries.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the sterling issue is important in the context of competitiveness but we must be careful not to overstate its importance.  For an outflow of trade and business to occur arising from a &ldquo;sterling shock&rdquo;, sterling would have to fall sharply below its equilibrium level.  Sterling is currently significantly above what most commentators consider to be its equilibrium level.  Therefore, sterling would have to fall a long way before it could be considered to represent an economic shock.</P>
      <P>A further point worth noting is that while sterling remains outside the euro zone, UK business is likely to face higher interest rates compared with businesses in the euro-area.</P>
      <P>The Government is not ignoring the need to prepare for the possibility of problems for Irish industry as a consequence of sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.  Consultants were appointed by Forfás under the auspices of its EMU business awareness campaign to examine the implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside of EMU.  Last July, Forfás launched a document which summarises the results of this study which identified actions in the fields of finance, marketing and distribution that firms could consider as part of their planning to cope with any fluctuations in exchange rates that may arise between the euro and sterling.  The document is included in the Forfás business awareness campaign's information pack for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> Furthermore, the issue of preparedness among the SME sector has been a particular focus of attention for the Forfás campaign.  The campaign has conducted two surveys on awareness and preparedness levels in the enterprise sector &mdash; a benchmark survey in June 1997 and a follow-up one earlier this year.  The surveys were conducted among 600 businesses and reflect the broad structure of Irish industry.  They found that, overall, SMEs are less well prepared for EMU than larger firms.  However, the more recent survey results indicated that more SMEs had begun to take action in preparing their business for the changeover for the euro.  Clearly, as 1 January 1999 approaches it is imperative that all Irish companies, large or small, intensify their efforts.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the level of awareness among the SME sector, including those companies in the Border area, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has undertaken a number of initiatives designed to reach smaller companies, including the publication of a short planning document setting out the different planning stages for the changeover which business should consider.  Over 80,000 copies of that document have been circulated.</P>

      <P>REPS payments compensate a farmer for the loss of output and related income which arises because the farmer now farms in a more environmentally friendly way.  They are thus a substitute for the income he would have got if he continued to farm more intensively.  REPS payments are accordingly taxable as income and I have no plans to change the present position.</P>

      <P>The person concerned lodged a claim for repayment of <Col N="184" /> excise duty on fuel used by him in the provision of a school bus run under contract to Bus Éireann.  The claim was dated 17 August 1998 and this presumably explains the reference to the &ldquo;Mineral Oil Order of 17 August 1998&rdquo; in the question.</P>
      <P>The claim was refused as the fuel in question was petrol which is not covered by the repayment provision in paragraph 12(11) of S.I. 307/75.  The claimant was informed by telephone on 7 September 1998 and a written confirmation followed.</P>
      <P>An appeal under section 104 of the Finance Act, 1995 concerning excise appeals has now been made.  It was received by the Collector, Customs and Excise, Custom House, Dublin on 9 October 1998.  The grounds for appeal are being considered and the appeals officer's determination will be given in writing within the 30 days of the date of receipt as provided for in sections 104(7) and (11) of the Finance Act, 1995.  If the claimant remains aggrieved by the decision of the appeals officer he may appeal to the appeals commissioners under section 105 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 12(11) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975) which provides for the repayment of excise duty is confined to heavy oils such as autodiesel used in certain passenger road services. Most vehicles used for such services are diesel-powered.  There is no corresponding provision for light oils such as petrol.</P>

A tabular statement listing the percentage of people employed in the Civil Service each year since 1993 follows.  As I have already indicated in a reply to an earlier question on the matter, the fact that the figure has dropped below the target of 3 per cent is a cause of concern and the matter is being kept under review.  The Heads of each Government Department and Office are fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3 per cent quota.  My officials are currently in the process of gathering the figures for 1 October 1998.</P>

      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that there are currently no queues for services outside Joyce House 8-11 Lombard St. East, Dublin 2, during opening hours. However, I am aware that the queues for services outside the registration offices have presented difficulties earlier this year and I regret the inconvenience to the people concerned. The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House, is statutorily a matter for An tArd Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the Superintendent Registrar, Dublin (and Registrars) who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's Office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin City and County area. This latter office in particular experienced a very high level of demand for certificates at certain times earlier this year, which was the primary cause of the queues outside the building.</P>

    <P>Measures have been taken to improve the situation. The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the Superintendent Registrar's Office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street and the planning of the necessary refurbishment to provide suitable accommodation for registrars of births, deaths and marriages has been completed. The board provided eight additional staff in the Superintendent Registrar's Office earlier this year to increase rate of production <Col N="186" /> of certficates and this improved the situation although it did not totally eradicate the queues on the busiest days.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department made accommodation available in Joyce House to facilitate the move of registrars of births, deaths and marriages to more spacious accommodation on the third floor of the buidling. This ensured a greater level of privacy and comfort to people registering births and deaths. This move also vacated space on the ground floor of the Superintendent Registrar's Office and facilitated the extension of the waiting area in that office. It will be appreciated that these measures considerably improved matters for the public attending at Joyce House. The possible extension of opening hours to include lunchtime opening is under discussion with the staff interests involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board currently has seven speech and language therapists providing services to the community in the Waterford area. The board's service plan for 1998 includes reference to a proposed overall increase of 20 paramedical staff, including speech and language therapists. I understand that the board is currently working with the co-ordinating committee on the preparation of a detailed plan for the development of services for children with disabilities which will include proposals to increase the number of speech and language therapists in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning speech therapy assessment for a person, whose details have been supplied to me, the position is that the provision of these services in individual cases is a matter for the relevant health board.  Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health board to have this case examined as a matter of urgency and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dental health action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service.  A consultant-led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.  Children are assessed, therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  The Eastern Health Board's consultant-led regional orthodontic unit opened at St. James' Hospital in September 1996.  I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that prior to the opening of this regional orthodontic unit the average waiting period for assessment was four to five years.  At present there is no waiting time for assessment or treatment in category one, the category of greatest need.  In the case of category two the waiting time for assessment has been reduced and those assessed as requiring treatment are facilitated immediately.  The number of category two patients awaiting assessment at present is 6,514 compared with 11,365 in 1996.</P>
      <P>I regret that the resources currently available for orthodontic services do not permit the treatment of category three patients.  However, these patients are being assessed on a phased basis on the overall direction and supervision of the consultant orthodontist to establish the level of their treatment need.</P>
      <P>In addition to services provided at the regional orthodontic department, treatment is also provided in satellite clinics in Crumlin, Ballyfermot and Finglas.  Satellite assessement clinics have been established in Coolock, Blanchardstown, Crumlin, Wicklow, Newbridge, Bray, Ballinteer and Kilbarrack.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board intends to develop further satellite clinics at North Strand, Clondalkin and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>It is also the board's intention to extend the regional orthodontic department at St. James' Hospital and to develop a second regional orthodontic department based at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the guidelines. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental <Col N="193" /> health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the special housing aid for the elderly scheme is administered by the health boards on <Col N="197" /> behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government under the direction of a task force which is chaired by an officer of that Department.  The guidelines on the operation of the scheme issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to health boards do not refer specifically to the provision of central heating.  Nevertheless, I understand that the category of works covered by the scheme is a matter for determination by health boards subject to the general direction of the task force. If the Deputy is aware of a particular difficulty in this area, perhaps he would let me have details and I will have the matter investigated.</P>

    <P>The current basic qualification for trainee and assistant house parents is the leaving certificate. However, assistant house parents must acquire a <Col N="198" /> recognised qualification in child care social care in order to progress to the top of the salary scale. Those seeking employment as house parents are required to possess a recognised qualification. The recognised qualifications are national diploma in child care, national diploma in applied social studies in social care (NCEA), diploma in child care/social care, diploma in applied social studies-social care (Dublin Institute of Technology) and any equivalent qualification.</P>
    <P>The former diploma in child care and creative play from Maynooth College and courses run by the Irish Pre-school Play Group are not deemed equivalent qualifications.  There is no diploma in pre-school child care awarded by Maynooth College.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to amend the qualifications.

      <P>The development of new facilities at the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf is an important element of the overall development of rehabilitation services in north Dublin.  Following the completion of the first phase of the new development in 1996, a project team comprising representatives of the hospital and officials from my Department began work on a development brief for the second phase of the work required at the hospital.  The brief for the second phase of the development includes provision for three 32 bed wards, physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities, X-ray and out-patients departments, new kitchen and canteen, boiler room and service accommodation, and new main entrance and reception area.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 208 of 28 April 1998.</P>

    <P>I am aware of a recent article in the scientific journal Veterinary and Human Toxicology which gave rise to concerns, reported in a national newspaper on 27 September 1998, regarding a possible connection between disease and deaths <Col N="202" /> of horses in the Askeaton area of County Limerick and acid rain.  I am also aware that, following a detailed examination of the report by the Irish Equine Centre on which the journal and newspaper articles were based, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a statement on 2 October 1998 to clarify that its intensive investigations do not indicate that the Askeaton area is subject to acid rain or to aerial contamination by aluminium.  The statement also confirmed that the Mid-Western Health Board, one of the agencies involved in the multidisciplinary team carrying out a major animal health investigation in the area since 1995, has found no evidence to date of excess human disease in the area which could be linked to aluminium.</P>
    <P>The EPA statement rejected inferences and speculative comments in the media which were not borne out by evidence, and sought to allay any fears which the local community might have as a result of misinformation, particularly in relation to possible implications for human health.

      <P>A priority objective for sustainable waste management is to reduce the production of waste to a minimum consistent with economic sustainability.  This is reflected in the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, which gives primacy to prevention.</P>
      <P>Government waste management policy is firmly grounded in this hierarchy of options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 provides a comprehensive and flexible legislative framework, within which local authorities can define and given effect to progressive waste management policies.  Under this Act, local authorities are required to make new, detailed, plans for the management of non-hazardous wastes within their functional areas, while EPA is required to <Col N="204" /> make a national hazardous waste management plan.  Reflecting the waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to prevent and minimise the production of waste and its harmful effects, encourage and support the recovery of waste, ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safety disposed of, and address the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle, in relation to waste disposal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the main conclusions of a report on the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion &mdash; 1996, which was prepared by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), including significant ozone depletion of greater than 50 per cent over the Antarctic.  However, the report expects ozone depleting substances to peak in the <Col N="205" /> atmosphere by the year 2000, and the assessment also indicates the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol, which should ensure a full recovery of the ozone layer by the middle of the next century if the protocol is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Ireland is meeting its commitments under the protocol by means of EU legislation, in common with the other EU member states.  Commitments include prohibitions on the production and use of ozone depleting substances, including <i>inter alia</i>, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  Following the most recent amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the European Commission has brought forward further proposals, which are now under discussion by the EU Council of Environment Ministers. These proposals go beyond the requirements of the protocol in relation to methyl bromide and hydrochlorofluorocarbons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 280, 282 and 283 together.</P>
      <P>Under article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, member states may not impede the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive, i.e., which is in accordance with the essential requirements on the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging, specified in Annex II of the directive and transposed into Irish legislation by means of the Waste Management (Packaging) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The European Commission has mandated CEN, the European standards agency, to prepare a range of European standards for the purpose of Article 10 of Directive 94/62/EC.  These standards will relate to the above-mentioned essential requirements.  Work on their development is progressing, and the position will shortly be subject to joint review by CEN, the European Commission and member states.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, make provision for the progressive reduction of the concentration levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium in packaging and packaging components.</P>
      <P>I am currently monitoring the development of initiatives in other member states aimed at reducing the hazardous nature of particular waste streams, including a number of voluntary programmes for the reduction or elimination of PVC in packaging.  I understand also that the European Commission is considering proposals for wide ranging initiatives in relation to PVC.</P>
      <P>The separate collection and recovery of hazardous materials in household waste will be addressed in the context of the National Hazardous Waste Management Plan being prepared by the EPA, which is expected to incorporate recommendations in this regard.  Consideration will also be had to a draft European Commission proposal for a Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, which addresses the collection and recovery of household hazardous waste.</P>

      <P>Austria and Luxembourg have not indicated their intention to introduce a general ban on the importation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to their jurisdiction.  Under the provisions of Article 16 of Council Directive 90/220/EEC, both member states have initiated provisional prohibition action in relation to one specific genetically modified maize product which was approved under the marketing provisions of the directive in 1997.  This limited and provisional prohibition action by Austria and Luxembourg is being addressed by the European Commission in the context of the procedures provided for under Article 21 of the directive.  I indicated in the reply to Question No. 102 of 26 November 1997 that Ireland would not support proposals from the European Commission requiring Austria and Luxembourg to <Col N="209" /> repeal their prohibition action.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298, 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>A number of different codes of law and other initiatives have an important role in protecting the landscape.  These include the operation of the physical planning code, which is the responsibility of my Department and the habitats regulations and the REP scheme, which do not come within the responsibility of my Department.  In this regard, the implementation of the provisions of the planning code is a matter for the individual local planning authorities.</P>
      <P>It is essential that those in charge of land use planning are aware of the importance of landscape as the context in which their decisions are taken.  I have, therefore, requested my Department to give priority to the preparation of new draft land use planning guidelines on high amenity landscapes and their treatment in local authority development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These guidelines will complement the land use planning guidelines already published by my <Col N="210" /> Department which are also relevant to protecting the landscape: these relate to telecommunications antennae and support structures and wind farm development.  Draft consultation guidelines have been published in relation to forestry development.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a range of other proposals which are, at least in part, designed to enhance the protection of the landscape.  Principal among these are proposals for reform of the planning code which I intend to bring to Government shortly; the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which is currently in preparation by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; the preparation of a national heritage plan, recently initiated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which will <i>inter alia</i> consider the protection, conservation, management and presentation of the natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I believe that all of the existing landscape protection measures, taken together with the initiatives outlined above, will ensure an increasingly effective regime for the conservation and preservation of the national landscape.</P>
    <P>Approaches are made from time to time to my Department on this matter by various interested parties.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996.  It is a matter for each authority to put in place arrangements to ensure their effective implementation.  I am concerned to see an improved level of compliance with the provisions of the regulations and, to this end, local authorities have been regularly urged by my Department to take all steps open to them to secure compliance by landlords with the regulations.</P>

      <P>Having regard to increasing needs, I am seeking additional resources for social housing in the 1999 Estimates.  Details of next year's local authority housing programme will be announced on publication of the Estimates and local authorities will be notified shortly thereafter of their authorised programme for 1999.  In addition to local authority housing, it is a matter for housing authorities to develop the full potential of the various other social housing measures open to them to respond to housing needs in their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 38(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, requires a local authority to provide and operate, or arrange for the provision and operation of, such facilities as may be necessary for the recovery and disposal of household waste <Col N="212" /> arising within its functional area.  Local authorities have discretion with regard to the recovery or disposal of other waste arisings.</P>
      <P>A situation in which individual local authorities exercise their waste planning and management functions in isolation from each other and from other service providers is not compatible with modern waste management needs.  Local authorities have been encouraged to adopt a regional approach to waste management planning, with a view to the development of regional solutions which deliver a more efficient provision of services and infrastructure.  Authorities have responded positively, and 29 are currently engaged in, or have completed, eight regional strategy studies.  This regional approach will facilitate the achievement of economies of scale providing a viable framework in planning and volume terms for the development of integrated and innovative waste management solutions, with segregated collection and incorporating materials recycling, organic waste composting, other treatment technologies and residual landfill.</P>
      <P>The recently published policy statement on waste management &mdash; Changing our Ways &mdash; sets a number of ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets over a 15 year period, outlines the role which local authorities should play to secure the achievement of those targets, and addresses the application of local authorities' resources.  Copies of this policy statement are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The detailed information requested is set out in the tabular statement below.  Waiting times are calculated as the longest waiting time for any applicant at a particular centre.  Applicants requiring an early test for urgent reasons <Col N="214" /> are, however, given tests within considerably shorter periods: at present some 40 per cent of test applicants are tested within ten weeks and some 50 per cent within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>My Department is responding to this unsatisfactory situation by increasing the numbers and productivity of its driver testers.  Saturday testing has already been introduced.  A further package of productivity measures has recently been concluded which will provide for an additional 9,000 tests per year.  The Civil Service Commission is at an advanced stage of establishing a panel from which further permanent driver testers will be recruited.  Additional testers are also being engaged on a temporary contract basis.</P>

      <P>Negotiations with the Commission are continuing with a view to resolving issues which have been raised by them with regard to the future availability of certain urban renewal reliefs relating to business.  In the meantime the expert advisory panel has been examining the 78 integrated area plans submitted by local authorities so that decisions on designation of areas and the tax incentives to apply can be announced and the new scheme commenced as soon as possible after the completion of the current negotiations with the EU.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Part VI of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, (No 7 of 1992) and the Environmental Protection Agency Act (Noise) Regulations, 1994 (S.  I. No. 179 of 1994) providing local authorities with powers to prevent or limit noise from any premises. Also, section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, (No. 28 of 1963) provides that a planning authority may attach specific conditions in respect of noise to a grant of permission for development.</P>
      <P>The European Commission published a Green Paper on future noise policy in November 1996 which aims to stimulate discussion on improving the effectiveness of noise policy.  The Green Paper provides, inter alia, an outline of a framework for action and future options for the reduction of noise from different sources.  While I have no immediate plans in this regard, further work towards finalisation of national regulations on noise will have regard to emerging policy at EU level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount recouped by my Department to local authorities in relation to the accommodation of homeless people and the provision of emergency accommodation for asylum seekers was £6 million in 1997.  At this stage, it is estimated <Col N="218" /> that recoupment will be in the region of £20 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this recoupment is attributable to emergency accommodation for asylum seekers is not readily available.  However, the Dublin local authorities paid £6,929,440 to the Eastern Health Board in respect of expenditure in 1997 on emergency accommodation for asylum seekers.  The Dublin authorities, in turn, claimed 90 per cent recoupment from my Department which was paid in 1997 and 1998.</P>
    <P>I am seeking additional resources for the accommodation of homeless persons in the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grant scheme is administered by the housing authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993. Subject to these regulations, it is a matter for each authority to determine issues such as the resources which are available to the scheme and whether a grant can be paid in an individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essential repairs grants are payable for houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of an essential repairs, the house can continue to meet short-term accommodation needs.  Authorities may pay grants up to the full approved cost of the repairs, subject to a maximum, which is adjusted in line with the house building cost index, and currently stands at £5,575.  However, housing authorities generally limit the grant they pay to twice the maximum recoupment available from my Department <Col N="219" /> resulting, in such cases, in an effective ceiling of £1,800.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the statutory regulations would not, in general, preclude the payment of a grant in respect of works such as partial re-roofing.  If there is a query in relation to an individual case this might, in the first instance, be raised with the particular housing authority involved.</P>

      <P>In reviewing their development plans, each planning authority must send a copy of the draft plan to neighbouring planning authorities.  This enables adjoining authorities to promote measures of harmonisation with adjoining authorities in relation to population settlement strategies and other planning policies, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin and mid-east regions are, on my Department's initiative, being drawn up at present by the local and regional authorities in those regions, in consultation with my Department and the Dublin Transportation Office.  It is intended that these guidelines, which I expect to be completed by March 1999, will provide an overall strategic context within which the subsequent development plan reviews of the constituent planning authorities in the two regions will be undertaken.  The Bill arising out of the review of planning legislation will oblige local authorities, in reviewing their development plans, to have regard to any strategic planning guidelines relevant to their area.</P>

    <P>The guidelines will address, in accordance with <Col N="221" /> the principles of sustainable development, all of the relevant socio-economic factors which will influence planning in the regions over the next 12 years or so.  These will include factors such as infrastructure and environment capacity and the population to be accommodated in the greater Dublin area, with an indicative distribution of that population.</P>
    <P>In addition, arising from the Report of the Study of House Prices published earlier this year, my Department is drawing up planning guidelines on residential density.

      <P>The building regulations place a duty on persons providing public buildings on or after 1 June 1992 &mdash; either by way of new construction, extension, or works in connection with material alterations &mdash; to cater for the needs of disabled people.  The regulations also apply to the common areas of apartment blocks. Technical guidance document M issued by my Department provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements in relation to access to relevant buildings and their facilities.  This document was framed in consultation with the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body which, at the time, included an officer of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>Under the building control system, primary responsibility for compliance rests with the owners, designers and builders.  Local building control authorities have a role in monitoring and enforcing compliance which they may carry out by random inspections and investigations of any compliants about non-compliance.</P>
      <P>A list of local authority building control contract officers was distributed by my colleague Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State, to various organisations representing disabled persons. My Department is currently preparing an updated list of contact officers.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it would be appropriate to require local building control authorities to formally consult third parties about the exercise of their statutory functions under the Building Control Act in individual cases.  However, it is always open to interested disabled persons and relevant organisations to make submissions and recommendations to the authorities on the implementation of the 1990 Act and to draw the authorities attention to buildings which do not comply with the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the case that people claiming social welfare payments are required to make their claim within a specified period of time.  Where a claim is not made in time, payment can only be backdated for a specified <Col N="223" /> period, the duration of which varies with the type of claim.</P>
      <P>The legislation in this matter has recently been significantly improved in the case of retirement, old age and survivors' contributory pensions.  Previously the general limit on back-dating of payments in these cases was six months.  The limit is now 12 months as provided for in the 1997 Social Welfare Act.  This means that full arrears is now paid for up to 12 months prior to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under regulations which I made in February last, a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid.  The regulations also provide for the possibility of full arrears, in cases where claims are delayed due to <i>force majeure</i>, proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or to Departmental error, and also to alleviate current financial hardship.  These provisions were designed to strike a balance between the need for effective management of the system and for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>
      <P>Payment of full arrears in all late claim cases, regardless of the circumstances for the delay in claiming, would give rise to very significant additional ongoing costs.  It is also reasonable in the context of proper management of the pensions system that people claim in time and have the responsibility of doing so.</P>
      <P>I would strongly encourage people to submit claims promptly to the Department if they consider that they might be eligible under a particular scheme.  In this way, they will receive their full entitlements from the time their need first arises. Information and scheme claim forms are widely available throughout the country, from the Department itself and from other information centres, on the range of social welfare services which are available.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 607 of 30 September 1998, a minimum yearly average of ten full-rate contributions is required to qualify for the <i>pro-rata</i> contributory pension which was introduced in November 1998.</P>
      <P>This is a minimum qualifying condition which applies to all insured people.  Its clear purpose is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of full-rate contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  As such, there are no plans to review this requirement.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to compensate persons who paid PRSI contributions in the self-employed sector who do not qualify for old age contributory pension in view of the fact that this situation has arisen as a result of the fact they were over the age of 56 when they began paying and the subsequently do not have ten years of contributions paid; and if he will refund the amount of contribution paid or back pay a pro-rata pension.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I am fully conversant with the issue in question and would like to reassure the Deputy, and this House, that the matter is receiving my detailed attention.  However, I must stress that the cost of paying an old age contributory pension to this group of people would be significant and any proposal in this regard would have to be assessed against other competing demands in the social welfare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to refunding contributions paid, I would point out that any self employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension may apply for a refund of the pension <Col N="225" /> element &mdash; 53 per cent &mdash; of his/her PRSI contributions which is payable, with interest.  I consider this a fair arrangement.</P>
    <P>A non-contributory pension is, of course, available to former self employed people, who have insufficient contributions, in the same way as it is available to every other citizen, resident in the State, subject to a mean test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 337 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare types payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last January, free travel passes had been issued in respect of around 505,000 people at an estimated annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to change the title of the free travel scheme to concession travel.  Travel under this scheme is free and therefore the title free travel is considered to be the most appropriate description of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the free travel scheme is based on the use of spare capacity and therefore time restrictions have been a feature of this scheme since its inception.  They apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive, and on Bus Eireann long distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 a.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  These restrictions have been in operation since the inception of the scheme in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or on suburban rail services in Dublin and Cork, or on services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country. Time restrictions are only in place on city and provincial bus routes because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in <Col N="226" /> the morning and evening.  They do not, however, apply in the case of people with mental disabilities, those attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The extension of unrestricted access to urban services at peak time on a more widespread basis would cause capacity problems for CIE and would give rise to additional cost unquantifiable at this stage.  However, the Department will continue to monitor the situation in consultation with the CIE group to assess the scope for improvements having regard to the capacity and cost constraints.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the one-parent family payment (OFP), a parent must have the &ldquo;main care and charge&rdquo; of the child(ren).  The &ldquo;main care and charge&rdquo; condition is satisfied by the parent who cares for the child(ren) most of theh time.  The fundamental premise on which the scheme is based is that the composite payment, comprising the personal and child dependent allowance, can only be paid to one of a couple.</P>
      <P>Where each parent has main care and charge of at least one of the children following separation, each may claim OFP based on the fact that they have the main care of at least one child.  In joint custody cases the parent with whom the child(ren) spends most of their time is deemed to be the lone parent and the other parent does not have title to the OFP scheme.</P>
      <P>In general these arrangements are working well.  However, because of the change which have been taking place in family structures and the increase in marriage breakdown a departmental working group was established to examine all of the issues relating to joint custody and the social welfare system and the possible options for change.  The findings of this group are currently being examined within the Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of a one-parent family payment from March 1997, as a widowed person, at the reduced rate of £23.50 a week due to means from her UK pension and other income.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of this payment is that the recipient must have at least one dependent child under 18 years of age, or between 18 and 22 years of age if in full-time education. When her daughter reached 22 years of age in June 1998 the person concerned was no longer entitled to one-parent family payment. Her case was subsequently referred to a local officer of my Department to establish whether she has an entitlement to widow's non-contributory pension, for which different rules apply in relation to means.  As soon as this investigation is completed a decision will be made and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The concept of desertion no longer exists in the social welfare code and deserted wives who have dependent children are treated in the same manner as all other lone parents with children.  Poverty studies which have been carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Combat Poverty Agency have shown that these family units face a particularly high risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Department's main response to the difficulties faced by lone parents is the one-parent family payment, introduced in 1997, which aims to strike a balance between providing a basic income for those who wish to care for their children on a full-time basis and, at the same time, encouraging and facilitating lone parents to move into paid employment and away from long-term dependency on social welfare payments.  The latter objective is achieved through disregards on the means test for one-parent family payment which means that a lone parent can earn up to £6,000 per year without any loss of entitlement. Lone parents can also apply for various labour market programmes and schemes such as the community employment scheme, back to work allowance and study options.</P>
      <P>In addition to the one-parent family payment lone parents also have access to the full range of secondary benefits administered under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the level and range of services currently being provided for lone parents. However, the systems currently in place are relatively new and their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and the needs of the lone parents themselves will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>RTE informs me that viewers receiving RTE 1 and Network 2 from the Westport transmitter normally receive good quality television reception. However, RTE is currently carrying out major engineering works on its network in the west.  Unfortunately, this led to some technical problems which resulted in poor quality output from the Castlebar transmitter.  As the Westport transmitter receives its input from Castlebar, any impairment on the Castlebar transmitter results in Westport viewers experiencing the same difficulties. All television dealers in the area affected were alerted to this defect by RTE.  According to RTE, the problems that existed have been cleared and viewers in Westport should now have good quality television reception.</P>

      <P>The 1916 Roll of Honour was on display for over 30 years as part of the 1916 Room exhibition in the National Museum. However, because of the danger of deterioration of the paper, the Museum decided to take the roll of honour off public display some years ago to ensure its preservation.  The roll can still be viewed by the public by special prior arrangement.</P>
      <P>I understand that the National Museum will be pleased to make a facsimile of the roll if this proves technically feasible once conservation of the roll has been completed with a view to integrating the facsimile into a public display in an appropriate context.</P>
      <P>While the museum has published a booklet on the 1916 period, it is also actively pursuing the feasibility of a publication focused on the names of the garrisons and the names of the participants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should explain that Government Departments/State agencies give access to the services provided by them to all persons regardless of their legal status. For that reason it is not always possible to differentiate between expenditure in the provision of a service or support to an asylum seeker from that provided to any other category of claimants.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, it is not possible at present to identify the overall cost of expenditure on asylum seekers in 1997 as separate provision was not made for such expenditure. However, I can say that a provision of £4.168 million has been made for 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers opened for business yesterday 12 October at 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin.  This new office <Col N="233" /> houses officials processing asylum applications, the appeals authorities, UNHCR, Eastern Health Board and medical screening.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing this accommodation, which arises mainly on the vote of the Office of Public Works, is approximately £3 million.  My Department has contributed £500,000 towards the cost of fitting out and I understand that the Eastern Health Board will also contribute proportionately towards the overall cost.</P>
    <P>I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs that the total cost of payments to asylum seekers by his Department amounted to £12 million in 1997. This figure includes expenditure in areas such as basic weekly payments under the SWA scheme, rent supplements, once-off exceptional needs payments, for example, for clothing and footwear, deposits to secure private rented accommodation. It is estimated that the total cost of social welfare payments to asylum seekers in 1998 could be of the order of £25 million, although the final year-end figure will depend on a number of factors, such as the number of existing cases who leave the system, when decisions are made on their claims for refugee status, and the length of stay in emergency accommodation, etc.</P>
    <P>I am advised by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the amount recouped by his Department to local authorities in relation to accommodation of homeless people and the provision of emergency accommodation for asylum seekers was £6 million in 1997.  The recoupment for 1998 is currently estimated to be in the region of £20 million.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the extent to which this recoupment is attributable to emergency accommodation for asylum seekers is not readily available.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Minister for Education and Science that it is not possible to identify the cost of the provision of education services to asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Minister for Health and Children that it is difficult to calculate the provision of health services for asylum seekers as it depends on their age profile and health status, information which is not readily available. However, I am informed that the average annual cost of providing health services in this country is £1,500 per person under the age of 65 and £2,400 per person over the age of 65.  I am also advised that the cost of medical screening for asylum seekers for the period 1 December 1997 to 31 Decembr 1997 was £13,000 approximately and the estimated cost for 1998 is £125,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>Under the Attorney General's scheme, judicial reviews have been initiated by a number of asylum seekers.  Due to the ongoing nature of this process it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the cost at this time.</P>

      <P>There are no service qualifications for any of the rights provided under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  The Act applies to all female employees who have notified their employer of their condition.</P>
      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, provides that a pregnant employee is entitled to a period of maternity leave of 14 consecutive weeks, known as &ldquo;the minimum period of maternity leave&rdquo;, of which at least four weeks must be taken before the end of the week in which her baby is due and four weeks after that week.  The remaining six weeks can be taken before or after the birth, as the employee wishes.  The Act also provides an entitlement to an optional further four weeks additional maternity leave following on immediately from the minimum period.  During absences under the Act all employment rights (except the right to remuneration) are preserved.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, all pregnant employees, including seasonal workers, who have complied with the necessary notification procedures in respect of their employers, are entitled to the minimum period of maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and all associated rights and protections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of maternity benefit is a matter <Col N="236" /> for my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  However, I understand that, in order to qualify for maternity benefit, a pregnant employee must have been granted leave from her employment in accordance with Section 8 of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and have the necessary social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>In accordance with an undertaking in An Action Programme for the Millennium, my Department has recently commenced a review of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  The treatment of seasonal workers and entitlement to maternity leave will be examined in the context of that review.</P>

      <P>While it is, of course, a matter for the news media organisations themselves to decide which members of their staff should report on foreign or domestic issues within my area of ministerial responsibility, the Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that by and large the various crime and security correspondents specialise on these issues.  Since my appointment in June 1997, crime and security correspondents from the national media have accompanied me on foreign visits on two occasions viz.  in May 1998 to Europol headquarters in The Hague and two weeks ago to Garda UN missions in Sarajevo, Croatia and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>In the case of my visit to Europol headquarters, all the crime and security correspondents from the daily national morning newspapers and RTE were invited to accompany me there for the purpose of being briefed on the role and functions of the organisation in the light of the passing of the Europol Act, 1997, into law in this jurisdiction.  One security correspondent from a national daily morning newspaper and one crime correspondent from another national daily morning newspaper accompanied me on that visit.  Both correspondents made their own travel and accommodation arrangements and all costs associated with those were met by their respective newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my recent visit to Garda contingents on UN missions, the editors of all national morning newspapers, the editor of the evening national newspaper and the head of news in RTE were invited by letter to nominate their crime or security correspondent to accompany me on the visit.  The Deputy may be aware that it is a longstanding practice for news media to occasionally use the opportunity of a ministerial visit to Irish personnel &mdash; Defence Forces or gardaí &mdash; serving <Col N="238" /> on UN missions to report on those missions for their respective organisations.</P>
    <P>At all events, the security correspondent from one national morning newspaper as well as the security correspondent from RTE travelled to the UN missions in question with me.  In this case, the correspondents in question travelled on the Government jet because of the particular difficulties for them in arranging commercial flights to Sarajevo, and onward from there to Croatia and Cyprus, within the timescale of my visit to the Garda personnel serving at these locations. As the Deputy may be aware, journalists have travelled on the Government jet on previous occasions when similar difficulties arose with the use of commercial flights to travel to a location. All accommodation and other costs incurred by the correspondents during the course of this visit are met by their respective organisations.</P>

      <P>In addressing the need for policy and legislative developments in relation to disability, it is essential that a comprehensive and sequential approach is adopted.  In this regard, a key development is the recent Government decision to establish a national disability authority on a statutory basis from next year.  A national disability authority establishment Bill is currently being drafted and is expected to be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>I wish also to outline for the Deputy's information the current position as regards discrimination in both employment and non-employment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1997, in its judgment on the constitutional reference of the Employment Equality Act, 1996, the Supreme Court ruled that the Bill failed to strike an acceptable constitutional balance <Col N="243" /> between the employment of people with a disability and the property rights of employers. As a result of this judgment clear bounds were set to the legal and political scope available to the Oireachtas in dealing with this socially important concept.</P>
    <P>The subsequent Employment Equality Bill, 1997, was amended to state in clear terms an employer's obligations in relation to the provision of special treatment or facilities for a person with a disability.  The Bill, signed into law in June of this year as the Employment Equality Act, 1998, provides that an employer must make a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability if that person would be capable of doing the job effectively with the assistance of special treatment or facilities, unless the provision of special treatment or facilities would give rise to cost other than a nominal cost to the employer.</P>
    <P>In the non-employment area, the Equal Status Bill, 1997, proposed to prohibit discrimination on a range of grounds, including disability, in non-workplace areas, including the provision of goods, facilities and services.  However, in June 1997, that Bill was also found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Revised equal status legislation is now being developed on the same general lines as that found to be unconstitutional but amended to meet the Supreme Court's requirements.  The revised Bill, which is being developed in accordance with legal advice, is expected to be published in late 1998 or early 1999.</P>
    <P>On enactment of this legislative programme, and when the accompanying institutional and services provision improvements for people with disabilities are in place, it will be possible to consider the form which a Disability Bill might take.</P>

      <P>The school in question, in common with the majority of schools in the scheme, already has the services of a home-school community liaison co-ordinator on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>The basis for the allocation of a home-school community liaison post is that each co-ordinator would serve approximately 500 to 700 pupils.  Frequently, this involves the clustering of two or more schools, sometimes on the same campus, as in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy.  The home-school community liaison service currently in place in the school in question is considered appropriate for the needs of the pupils.</P>
      <P>Schools selected for inclusion in the home-school community liaison scheme serve areas where there are concentrations of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be fully considered in the context of any future expansion of the home-school community liaison scheme.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for grant aid under the third level student support schemes, a student must be pursuing a full-time under-graduate course of at least two years' duration or a postgraduate course of at least 1 year's duration.  As the course in question is an under-graduate course of one year's duration, students are not eligible for grant assistance in respect of their attendance on the course.  I would mention to the Deputy however, that as an exceptional matter in the 1997-98 year, grant aid was provided to and fees paid on behalf of students attending this course as the students concerned had been advised by the college authorities that the course was eligible for assistance.  My Department notified the college authorities and the vocational education committees that the exceptional arrangement applied only to students pursuing the course in the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>The Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology has advised my Department that it is seeking redesignation of the course by the NCEA as a graduate diploma course.  It will be a matter for the institute to advise my Department of any redesignation so that consideration can be given to its eligibility under the student support schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked my Department to investigate the particular circumstances of the person to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>My Department's general policy in terms of identifying children with specific learning disability (dyslexia) is in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee. The criteria which are used consist of: assessment by a psycholgist on a standardised test of intelligence, which places general intellectual ability within the average range or above; and performance in basic literacy skills using objective criteria, such as standardised tests.</P>
      <P>It would be expected that not more than some 2 per cent of the overall pupil population would be found in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with <Col N="249" /> specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools.  At present, there are four special schools and six special classes dedicated to the needs of children with specific learning disability.  Special classes are established as required on the basis of assessed need.</P>
    <P>In 1997 my Department allocated a sum of £24,971 to the Association of Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities (ACALD) to assist in their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas.  My Department is at present considering a request for further funding from ACALD.</P>

The question of increasing the allocation for guidance will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>
      <P>To be appointed to an incremental post as a guidance counsellor, a teacher must be fully qualified to teach in the relevant sector, that is, secondary, vocational or community/ comprehensive, and must have an additional qualification in guidance which is normally awarded at the end of a postgraduate course of at least a year's duration.  I am satisfied that, with the relatively recent increase in the number of training courses available for guidance counsellors from an original two courses to six courses, sufficient places can be made available to meet the need for guidance counsellors in schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395, 396, 397 and 402 together.</P>
      <P>As soon as I became aware of the proposed closure of Devoy Barracks, Naas, arrangements were made with the Department of Defence for the property to be inspected by senior staff of the planning and building unit of my Department, in the context of accommodation for apprenticeship education.  Arrangements were also made for the property to be inspected by a firm of architects. Following these inspections it was decided that the barracks did not provide an appropriate environment or meet the needs of the new modules for the education and training of apprentices. There are no plans in my Department at present to use any or all of Devoy Barracks for either first, second or third level education facilities.</P>
      <P>During the period January to June 1998, extensive consultations took place between my Department and FÁS in relation to the projected demand for apprentice places.  As a result a number of new building projects were approved for the IT sector which would facilitate an increase in the intake of apprentices to the institutes of technology nationally.  To further meet the growing demand for additional apprentice education training places, particularly in the Dublin and Cork regions, a broad range of accommodation options are at present being considered in the context of suitability and value for money criteria.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is providing additional funding to meet the staffing and other running costs associated with the increased apprentice intake in the current academic year.  Furthermore, my Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with all the relevant parties regarding the resource requirement for the projected increases in the 1999-2000 academic year and thereafter.</P>

      <P>In the case of the Bachelor of Education degree and the graduate diploma courses for primary teaching, entrants to a college of education are required to complete a health declaration for submission to the relevant college's medical officer.  The medical officer must be satisfied with the information on the health declaration.  On graduation, the students are again required to complete a similar health declaration before they can be appointed to a post in a national school. When completing those health declarations, students are informed that my Department and the colleges of education are committed to a policy of taking a modern approach to health and disability issues.</P>
      <P>In the case of entry to the Bachelor of Education degree in home economics, each candidate must pass a medical examination before being admitted to the course.  Again, a policy of taking a modern approach to health and disability is followed. In the case of post primary teachers, a satisfactory medical report must be submitted prior to appointment in the case of persons applying to enter a salaried teaching post for the first time or reapplying following a break in service. The purpose of the medical report is to assess whether the applicant has a reasonable prospect of giving regular, continuous and efficient service and of being in a position to afford a proper duty of care to the pupils.</P>
      <P>No medical requirement exists for students entering the Higher Diploma in Education courses.  The physical education course in the University of Limerick requires students to achieve a satisfactory standard in a mobility ability test.</P>

    <P>A range of measures have been introduced in recent years which have attributed to an increase in the number of mature students in third level education.  These include improvements in the student support arrangements, the free fees initiative, provisions allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses.  In addition, the <Col N="256" /> proposed new institute of technology at Blanchardstown and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute will have a major focus on non-standard applicants and on mature students and continuing education.  Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority targeted funding to its institutions for initiatives designed to support the participation of mature students, particularly second chance students.  In 1997, the authority provided £601,000 for projects in this area.</P>
    <P>Part-time options are often more attractive to mature students and while a current age profile for part-time students is not available, it is estimated that approximately 85 per cent of the 23,000 part-time students currently in higher education are mature students.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places <Col N="257" /> in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.  Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October, preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases, such as those outlined by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that an alteration to the provisions would require amending legislation.  I have asked my Department to keep this issue under review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the particulars concerning the provision of school transport for the pupil referred to by the Deputy.  My Department understood that transport arrangements had been put in place by St. Joseph's national school and that the pupil had been attending school on a regular basis.  I understand that this service discontinued on Friday, 9 October and that the pupil in question cannot attend school without an alternative service being put in place.</P>
      <P>Wherever possible, my Department sanctions a home pick-up/set-down service for pupils of special classes or special schools.  When this is not possible either because of distance or cost, a special transport grant is sanctioned towards the cost of private transport arrangements.  I understand that the principal difficulty in this case is that the school bus cannot fit down the road leading to the child's home and her parents are not in a position to bring her to the pick-up point.  My Department is currently investigating, with Bus Éireann, what alternatives can be put in place and I am hopeful that a resolution to these transport difficulties will be made in the near future.</P>

The first application was received in response to Circular 26/97 which sought applications from serving teachers.  This was received and acknowledged in October 1997. The second application was receieved in response to Circular 10/98 which sought applications from retired teachers.  This was received in August 1998 and has been acknowledged.</P>
      <P>The teacher in question retired in July 1996. On the basis of his service record, the teacher is eligible to purchase service.

      <P>The children in question were granted free transport under the scheme on the understanding that they were attending their nearest suitable school.  However, it came to the attention of Bus Éireann and my Department that these pupils reside nearer to another school.</P>
      <P>That transport facilities have been held by children contrary to the terms of the school transport scheme in no way confers a continuing right to these facilities.  Accordingly, the relevant families were advised in March 1998 that free transport could not be offered beyond the Easter term 1998.</P>
      <P>Having re-examined the matter, I regret my Department is not in a position to allow free transport in this instance.  However, the families in question may continue to avail of transport to the school they attend at a cost of £20 per pupil, per term.

      <P>It is estimated that the special school transport scheme caters for a total of 9,000 pupils with special needs and involves approximately 450 vehicles.  There are 108 special schools and 403 classes for children with special needs currently in place.  The current pilot escort scheme caters for five special schools for children with physical disabilities.  Grants are also provided towards the cost of escort provision for week-end transport for two schools for children with visual impairment and three schools for children with hearing impairment.  The scheme provides funding for escorts on 38 transport routes.  My Department does not have the precise number of special needs children travelling on these routes, however it is estimated that there are approximately 350 children involved.  An annual grant of £3,200 issues to schools in the pilot escort scheme towards the cost of employing a transport escort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, all special schools and classes were <Col N="261" /> invited to apply for escort provision.  My Department received 100 applications covering 380 transport routes.  The estimate of £2 million referred to by the Deputy was calculated on the basis of an increase of the escort grant to £5,000 per annum and provision of escort grants for the 380 transport routes for which applications were received.</P>

      <P>Each of the three schools referred to by the Deputy lost a teaching post at the end of the 1997-98 school year as a result of a decline in enrolments.  I should point out that one of the three schools has disadvantaged status.  Each of the three schools was allocated a teacher counsellor post for the 1998-99 school year.  This, however, was not to compensate for the loss of assistant teachers but rather to address a particular need in these schools for the service.</P>
      <P>Teacher counsellor posts have been allocated to the selected schools for the purposes of supporting these schools in their efforts to manage the behaviour of pupils who are disruptive-disturbed, and to enable the schools to teach these pupils effectively.</P>

      <P>While the responsibility for the operation of FÁS schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the provision of additional assistance to schools for clerical services.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional capitation grants for <Col N="262" /> primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and has been in operation since 1 September 1992.  The PESP provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.  Currently, all schools of 195 pupils or more, not including schools in the 1978 scheme outlined above, qualify for a grant of £15 per pupil, to a maximum of £7,500 per annum, towards the cost of clerical services.</P>
    <P>At second level the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and clerical services. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme-wide basis.  It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.  All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to further improvements in these programmes as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the question of the eligibility of different categories of school for receipt of grant aid under the technology integration initiative (TII) element of the Schools IT 2000 programme which is funded entirely through the Exchequer.  Each eligible first and second level school received a basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil in May of this year, with top-up amounts being provided in the case both of ordinary schools with special classes and special schools.</P>
      <P>The schools deemed eligible for grant aid were all recognised primary schools and all second-level schools recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the funding under the initiative was allocated to second-level schools is consistent with the way these schools are funded by my Department for other purposes.  Fee charging schools do not receive the <i>per capita</i> and other grants to which schools in the free education scheme are entitled.  Special arrangements are in place to cater for pupils wishing to be educated in schools with a Protestant ethos, all of which are fee charging.  These schools are eligible for all grants payable to schools in the free education scheme with the exception of the <i>per capita</i> grant.  Accordingly, these schools were also considered eligible for assistance under the technology integration initiative.</P>

    <P>Underlying these projections are the following assumptions:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> It is assumed that participation in transition year will grow from a level of 42 per cent for those entering senior cycle in 1997 to 66 per cent for those entering in 2003.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> It is assumed that the retention rate to completion of the senior cycle programmes will grow by 10 percentage points in the period under consideration.</P>
