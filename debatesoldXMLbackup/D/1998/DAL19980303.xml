      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a very positive meetings with the SDLP and Sinn Féin in Government Buildings last week.  Both meetings were very helpful.  We comprehensively discussed a number of issues involved in the talks process.  In my meetings with both parties I stressed that we should all hold steadily on course and the importance of continuing to work towards reaching agreement by Easter, with the participation of all the parties.  Paramilitary extremists on all sides should not be allowed to dictate the pace &mdash; and in this regard I would like to congratulate the Garda for its success recently, including yesterday in Louth, in preventing further attacks.  What we need is for all of the parties to focus on the issues and work to achieve the necessary compromise and agreement.</P>
      <P>My meeting with Prime Minister Blair last Thursday in London was also constructive and helpful.  We discussed the best way to move forward to secure an agreement.  It was agreed that further intensive discussions will take place with the parties in an effort to secure agreement on an issue by issue basis, focusing immediately on constitutional, security, policing and equality issues.  We both agreed that there was a need to intensify efforts to complete work by Easter and I am optimistic that we will meet this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the talks should move to a venue abroad, no decision one <Col N="4" /> way or the other has been taken about moving the talks.  We will of course continue to examine every option which we believe could help move the talks forward, and in this situation all suggestions will be kept under review.  As I indicated here on 17 February, the general practice in the negotiations has been for the two Governments to act jointly, including in the presentation of any papers.  Whether and when to present a paper to the participants or the independent chairmen bringing together the results of the work with the parties under way and envisaged will be determined by the Governments in the light of progress in the three strands.</P>
    <P>I also had a meeting with David Trimble last Friday while I was in London.  We discussed recent developments and how best to make progress.  As in all my meetings, I emphasised the need to stay focused on the prize of an agreement and not to allow ourselves to be put off course.</P>
    <P>While in London I attended a reception for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy at the Savoy Hotel.  I also attended a gala evening at the Copthorne Hotel, which has strong Irish links, to mark the 25th anniversary of its opening.  I also attended the launch of Business '98 last Friday, a publication by the <i>Irish Post</i> newspaper, in conjunction with Bank of Ireland and IDA Ireland.  This publication reflects the growing contribution and influence of people of Irish origin in business life in Britain and is aimed at improving business links and communications between Irish business people in Britain and between the business communities in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the announcement yesterday by EU Commission President, Jacques Santer, of new economic aid to support the peace process.  The allocation of a further £88 million by the European Commission and its approval by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament is a recognition of the success of the programme to date in reaching those communities affected most by the years of violence.  I agree with President Santer that we can learn from the European Union in terms of overcoming division and reconciling our past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Government's proposals for amending Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in the context of a settlement?  When does the Government intend making the wording of the proposed amendment available?  Will it be made available to the talks participants or, in the first instance, to this House?  What would be the likely date for the holding of a referendum to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as part of an overall settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of all of these matters will occur if we can reach agreement.  I will not outline the issues involved at this stage, but they have not moved much further from what was discussed some time ago.  There have been many discussions and many internal papers from <Col N="5" /> the British and Irish Governments on the constitutional issues.  We have now decided to consider the constitutional, institutional and equality issues as separate agenda items and in separate papers.  I hope to reach agreement on these aspects with the British Government and with the parties individually and collectively.  If we have a referendum in May, which is the target we are working towards, I hope it will be held in the later part of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How much time would that give the House to consider the wording of the amendment to the Constitution?  Will the wording be negotiated at the talks or will the Government state its position on it in the hope that it will command agreement among the other parties?  If the latter is the case, when will the Dáil be brought into the Government's confidence regarding its intentions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Dáil to be brought into the Government's confidence as soon as possible after agreement has been reached.  The 30 day rule will be used to ensure there is adequate time for the House to debate the issue. The British Government mentioned 8 May, but I explained in terms of timing that late May appears a more realistic date to allow for the 30 day rule.</P>
      <P>The Government put forward its view on all the issues, including the constitutional aspects. There have been a number of discussions with the British Government, including one this morning on the constitutional issues.  The British Government put forward some internal papers; these are not the first papers and they are unlikely to be the last.  It put forward several papers since the beginning of the year.  It is a case of trying to fine tune the contents and I am anxious to sign off on as many aspects as possible to lessen the number of working papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider it somewhat anomalous that the Government is discussing the wording of the Constitution with the British Government when parties in the House are not being consulted about the wording of an amendment on which the Government hopes to have agreement in the House?  It will be one of the biggest amendments ever made to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The heading on constitutional issues is not the only way forward.  As the Deputy is aware from the Framework Document negotiations, a wording has been discussed by the two Governments.  Discussions have moved on and there have been some changes, although there have been no major changes in substance.  The House will be informed in plenty of time, but ultimately the people make the decisions on changes to the Constitution.  I will be anxious to keep the House informed about all parts of the agreement, <Col N="6" /> not only the constitutional aspects, when it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply to the effect that the wording of Articles 2 and 3 discussed during the Framework Document negotiations is still being debated and has not been changed substantially worries me.  Will the Taoiseach find a mechanism to consult the leaders of the Opposition parties about the issue of Articles 2 and 3?  It is critical to ensure there is complete support in the House for changes to the Constitution given that they will be part of an agreement between the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland parties.</P>
      <P>Regarding his meetings with Sinn Féin, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Trimble, the Taoiseach said the meetings with Sinn Féin and Mr. Blair were successful.  However, he did not use the word &ldquo;successful&rdquo; in relation to his meeting with Mr. Trimble.  In what way did the Taoiseach find the meeting with Sinn Féin successful as against his meeting with Mr. Trimble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa should not be concerned about the first matter and he should not read too much into his second point.  In terms of the constitutional issues, the Deputy knows what was presented at the time of the Framework Document.  Much work has been done on that wording and also on section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act.  We will certainly be anxious to discuss this with all parties in the House when there is some progress on the constitutional agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from that reply that we will not face a <i>fait accompli</i> with regard to Articles 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly want to discuss those Articles.  They are a major part of the agreement that will go before the people.  I hope the agreement in the House over 20 to 25 years on these issues will hold if we get to a final settlement.</P>
      <P>My discussions with the SDLP and Sinn Féin were very detailed and lasted two to three hours. I endeavoured to look at all the working papers put forward by the Governments and the parties to see what elements among the many issues raised in those papers might lead to agreement and what would lead to differences.  I tried to narrow down areas of disagreement and see what they might mean.  I sought to achieve a clear picture, not agreement, and those meetings were very useful.  There was a follow-up meeting with the SDLP that I did not attend.</P>
      <P>When I met Mr. Trimble, we discussed the ongoing talks process and how we might reach a conclusion on the papers.  I was particularly interested in exploring Strand 1 issues with him with a view to hearing his opinion of how that was progressing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to any timetable relating to a referendum on constitutional change, is it the intention of both Governments to have a referendum on or around 8 May?  If so, the 30 day rule referred to by the Taoiseach means the Dáil would have to have the text of such a Bill, notwithstanding bilateral agreements with party leaders.  Therefore, could we discuss changes to Articles 2 and 3 before the final talks reached agreement?  Have I misread the Taoiseach's comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that 8 May will be the day because of the 30 day rule.  The UK Parliament's procedures mean it is even less likely.  A later date in May might be appropriate. We would have to have a separate referendum Bill in this House, and if its wording is agreed by the other parties, it would be appropriate to debate it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage the House being possibly asked to give its assent to changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in advance of any final settlement being negotiated among the parties at the Northern Ireland talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the agreement is completed within the talks with the British Government.  There will have to be an overall agreement and the main part of that would be our constitutional change, which would have to be discussed in this House.  It would certainly have to be discussed informally, although I am not ruling out a formal discussion on the matter.  I would like to conclude this matter, if I could get agreement from all sides.  We have spent a great deal of time in recent months discussing constitutional, institutional and equality matters.  We are trying to bring them to a conclusion, but we must get the agreement of the parties.  With the exception of policing, other matters will not change very much.  Rather than placing the whole agreement before the parties and then discovering there are enormous differences to be resolved, we are trying to narrow down matters into different sections, such as constitutional, institutional, policing and equality matters.  Those are the four main areas where we are trying to narrow the differences between the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Unfortunately, disputed marches and parades have contributed significantly to polarisation among the communities in Northern Ireland.  They have been a big factor in increasing sectarianism and bitterness.  Is the Taoiseach concerned, therefore, about the controversy surrounding the Parades Commission and the likelihood that it may not now command universal respect?  Has the Taoiseach discussed this matter and the difficulties that may arise in the forthcoming so-called marching season with any of the parties he met in recent times?  Does he agree it is crucial that communities at local <Col N="8" /> level begin to engage in genuine dialogue across the divide with a necessary measure of compromise on both sides so that the right to march and express one's opinion is balanced with sensitivity and respect for the other side, irrespective of which side that is?  Will the Taoiseach undertake to use his influence, with any of the parties in Northern Ireland with whom he has influence, to urge them to work towards achieving such agreement and thereby avoid the tension and brinkmanship that have resulted from disputes over parades in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always tried to support the Parades Commission because the principle of an independent assessment and authoritative judgment made in a neutral and fair fashion is the correct way to proceed.  I discussed this issue with everybody I met in recent times.  I am concerned about this matter, particularly having regard to the concerns emanating from all levels of the Nationalist community at the perceived lack of balance within the commission because of the latest appointments.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will raise this matter at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference next Thursday.  Regardless of the individuals involved, some of whom I know very well, the public perception is vitally important to the work of the commission in the future.  Its role this summer and in the years ahead in getting public acceptance for the decisions it makes as a commission will be vital.  The sensitivity and emotion that surrounds the marches must also be considered.  It has to be balanced and fair.  Ultimately, the fairness of the commission &mdash; I have stated this to some of the members &mdash; can only be interpreted by the decisions it makes.  On the question of urging communities to get together, to work together and to operate together, the commission is meeting some of the communities.  Meetings have been sought by some of the communities with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would like to see many more meetings.  There is not a great deal of evidence to show that across community lines they are endeavouring to put in a great deal of effort at meeting.  I take this opportunity to urge them to do so.</P>

      <P>Has the wording of a possible amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution been discussed by the Taoiseach with any of the parties he met, namely, the SDLP, the Unionist Party and Sinn Fein?  Has any of the parties had sight of any wordings the Government may be contemplating for amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  I join the Taoiseach in congratulating the security forces who put their lives at risk in detecting and defusing the bomb at Hackballscross, County Louth. Was this bomb intended for use on this side of the Border or on the other side and who does the Taoiseach believe was responsible for preparing it?</P>

      <P>How does the Taoiseach think it will be possible to get the parties to sign up to an agreement, part of which is contingent on change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, without actually discussing the wording of the constitutional change with them, given that in matters of the Constitution the wording is everything?  The intentions and the principles are of comparatively little importance in comparison with the actual words that go into the Constitution.  Is it his intention to discuss the wording of the changes to Articles 2 and 3 with the parties in the talks at any stage between now and the agreement being signed off?</P>

      <P>In relation to the Parades Commission where he indicated there were some concerns in regard to a lack of balance, will the Taoiseach confirm that the balance being sought is not numerical or a token presence of particular representatives of the community but people who have an understanding of the mindset of the various conflicting parties and a willingness to seek ways of overcoming those conflicts?  It would be disastrous if people were appointed to the Parades Commission simply to create a perception of equality or balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct but the Deputy will agree that the perception of this issue is vitally important and will play a key role in relation to whether the public will accept the decisions taken by the commission.  It is regrettable that in Northern communities judgments that create the public perception are based on people's backgrounds.  The judgment of one of the appointees, with whom I have had many dealings during the years and who does not come from the Nationalist tradition, on these issues is fairly good.  Other Members know the individual I am talking about but it is difficult to convince people in Nationalist communities of this.</P>

There must also be people with a good insight into the mindsets of the people in conflict over these parades.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the formidable agenda of discussions he is having on the issues of equality, constitutional change and so on.  Has he considered the issue of intimidation in the context of an election which might be held to new institutions which might be established following a settlement?  Is he aware of the extent to which punishment beatings are being used to dominate particular areas and of the fear among some parties in Northern Ireland that these tactics will continue to be used, perhaps in an oblique way, following a settlement with a view to levering more power for particular political parties which happen to be associated with paramilitaries?  Does he consider that we will still need to have a means of applying the Mitchell principles following a settlement in the context of its operation?  Does he have proposals for ensuring that guarantees of compliance with the Mitchell principles will be sought from those seeking to participate in institutions to be established following a settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a bit down the road.  I have always spoken out against punishment beatings which are used to a frightening degree in both communities to enforce the will of certain paramilitary groups.  How all these issues can be dealt with brings us back to the major issue of policing.  In normal society these matters would be considered unacceptable by everybody, except by a small group which supports the use of violence.  Unfortunately, the issue of policing has not been dealt with adequately in many communities. This is acknowledged in the recent report of the Chief Constable of the RUC.  The SDLP has been stating for the past 30 years that the policing and equality issues are bigger than others.  They have to be dealt with adequately.  There have been discussions recently on how we can move to a position where both communities can have confidence on the issue of policing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the settlement is agreed in May I presume the institutions will be established quickly thereafter.  Before they can be established there has to be an election which I presume will take place later this year.  Will the Taoiseach agree that any arrangements that need to be made to ensure parties and paramilitaries associated with parties do not use paramilitary tactics to influence political outcomes will have to be agreed as part of the settlement in addition to and complemented by any agreements that will be reached on policing which will take a while to put into effect?  As it is unlikely any new policing arrangement will be fully in operation on the day the first election takes place for the new institutions, will the Taoiseach agree this is a matter that ought to be <Col N="11" /> settled beforehand as part of the process?  Does he consider it ought to be agreed as part of any settlement that the Mitchell principles will continue to apply and will not be simply cast aside once a settlement has been agreed initially?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Mitchell principles will continue to apply forever more in all circumstances.  That would be the wish of this House. There would be quite an amount of time from the time of an agreement to elections under strand one to when strand two implementation bodies would be set up with executive powers.  Setting up new arrangements for policing would also involve quite some time.  In all that period the Mitchell principles would have to apply.</P>

      <P>In Question No. 10, I asked the Taoiseach if he discussed other matters not related to questions on Northern Ireland but he did not refer to that in his comprehensive reply to Questions Nos. 1 to 14 inclusive.  In the course of his discussions with the British Prime Minister did he raise the issue of the UK's European Union Presidency and whether in that context the UK is prepared to support requests that the European Commission undertakes a study to examine the employment impact that will result from the abolition of duty free sales in June next year?</P>

I discussed the UK's attitude to it and the fact that it had not included it as an initiative during its Presidency.  I informed the Prime Minister that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will shortly publish a report on it.  I asked that he and his ministerial colleagues try to support changes and movements in this regard. He listened to what I said and reiterated what he and a number of British Ministers stated previously, that they will take their lead from what a number of countries are doing and will take note of our position and what we are doing.  We are urging them to take that lead during their Presidency.  The Prime Minister will reflect on those issues, but we will have to get more than one country and, perhaps, more than two or three to push this issue.</P>

That must be borne in mind and worked towards consistently.  Even if we had acceptable institutions in the three tiers, if we do not have an acceptable police force, there will be great difficulty in having an agreement that will last. Given that it appears we will have a referendum in May or soon after, is the Taoiseach aware that in recent elections in Northern Ireland there has been an increasing tendency towards malpractice in electoral affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Séamus Mallon is probably the only person who has prepared a blueprint on that issue over the years and I continuously use and quote from it because there is no other on policing matters in Northern Ireland.  Few of the reforms he outlined in the four separate pieces of work he has done on this over the past ten to 15 years have been considered in terms of the chief constables of the RUC taking on board what he has said.  Electoral abuse has gone on for years and the British Government and the parties are aware of it. People will do all they can to avoid it, although that is easier said than done.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 12 on 7 October 1997, pursuant to the provisions of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the commission prepared its first programme which was approved by the Government and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in January 1977. The commission has advised that the majority of topics listed in the first programme have now been dealt with in its published reports, consultation papers and working papers.  Details of these are contained in appendices to the commission's annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In addition to the first programme, research undertaken at the request of successive Attorneys General, as provided for in section 4(2)(c) of the Act, also formed a substantial part of the commission's work.  Details of the research undertaken pursuant to these requests by the Attorney General are also to be found in appendices to the annual reports of the commission.</P>
      <P>I indicated last October that the work on hand in the commission included examination of a number of areas of the law and following is their current position.  A consultation paper on the legal implications of the signing in 1996 by Ireland of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoptions 1993 was published in November 1997.  This will be followed by a report on the subject to be published later this year.  The commission had hoped to publish a further report on conveyancing law before the end of 1997.  I understand it is now envisaged it will be published before the end of May 1998.  The commission is continuing its work on the preparation of working papers in the areas of drafting and interpretation of legislation, the law of homicide, the law relating to trespass and the law relating to aggravated, exemplary and restitutionary damages.  As is usual, a detailed account of the work being undertaken by the commission will be included in its annual report for 1997, which is in preparation and which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
      <P>I also referred in the House to a report on the organisation and management of the commission. With the sanction of the Minister for Finance, Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants were engaged by the commission to carry out a review following a tendering process.  The report, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library, was presented to the commission in April 1997.  Following consideration by the commission of the recommendations and arising from consultations between it and the Attorney General, discussions are ongoing between the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance about the recommendations relating to information technology and staffing.  Other recommendations in the report are the subject of discussions between the commission and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> Arising from consideration of the consultants' report, the Government has agreed to establish a consultative committee comprising representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society, under the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General, to assist the Attorney General in his consultations with the commission in relation to research programmes, to assist the Attorney General in the selection of specific topics for examination by the commission and to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the commission.  The Attorney General has also agreed to make available to the commission the services of a parliamentary draftsman to assist with projects, subject to the Government's legislative programme having priority.</P>
    <P>On expiration of his term of office last October, the President of the commission agreed to stay on as President until 30 June 1998 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the consultants' report.  I acknowledge the contribution of the President and all the members of the commission, past and present.</P>

      <P>What were the reasons for the delay in producing the report on conveyancing?  Is the Taoiseach aware that, whereas the number of claims against employers and insurance companies has not increased in the period 1985-95, the size of awards of damages for claims has increased at an average rate of 8 per cent per year above inflation?  The size of awards rather than the number of claims is the reason for the increase in insurance premia.  This directly relates to the awards of damages made by judges.  Has the Taoiseach examined whether the basis upon which damages are awarded is realistic and reasonable in light of the overall need of society to avoid the development of a claims culture, to maintain reasonably low insurance premia, to maintain high levels of employment and enterprise and to avoid developing a sense that one should always seek compensation for every misfortune which may occur?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Conveyancing is a detailed and complicated area and work has been ongoing.  It is not a question of delay but ongoing work by the commission.  It is hoped to complete the work by the end of 1997.  This date has drifted by a few months but it is anxious to bring forward the report as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's second question is a separate issue.  I agree that the compensation culture is dangerous and pushes up costs and the cost base for employment and competitiveness.  It has to be tackled on all fronts, including the legal front, but there are many issues which have to be dealt with to ensure that we do not reach a situation in which compensation becomes the order of the <Col N="16" /> day.  A number of ministerial colleagues have spent hours discussing this issue during Question Time.</P>

It will be some time before it brings forward its report.  However, issues such as compensation and the culture of compensation affect an even greater number of areas than the commission is considering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contained a number of commitments in the area of taxation.  I am glad to say that the last budget gave me the opportunity to advance these commitments significantly.</P>
      <P>My priority in the 1998 budget was to increase the personal allowances and reduce tax rates.  Personal allowances were increased by £250 in the case of a single person and £500 for a married couple.  Both the standard and top rates of income tax were reduced by 2 per cent.  Furthermore, the PRSI free allowance was increased by £20 to £100 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
      <P>Due to the considerable cost of these measures it was only possible in the budget to widen the bands by £100 single and £200 married.  In the light of the above, and allowing for growth in incomes, it is estimated that the proportion of taxpayers who are taxed at the standard rate of income tax will decline slightly in the coming tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitments set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, including increasing the proportion of taxpayers being taxed at the standard rate, will be implemented over the five year period of the programme.  However, as stated in the programme, the full implementation <Col N="17" /> of the measures will depend on continued strong growth in the economy, as all policies will be subject to the overriding requirement to stay within the terms of the EU Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria.  The precise changes to be included in any budget will of course be decided at budget time each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he aware of figures released by his Department showing that 18,000 more taxpayers will move from the standard to the higher tax rate under his budgetary proposals?  This runs counter to his promise in the programme for Government.  Is he also aware that in reply to a written question on 9 December, he stated that the percentage of taxpayers liable to pay income tax at the standard rate will increase from 37 per cent to 38.2 per cent after the budget?  Contrary to the commitments in the programme for Government, the position for those on the standard rate will worsen after this budget.  Does the Minister accept that the commitment in the programme for Government is meaningless in the context of his first budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the contentions put forward by the Deputy.  This year's budget cut both the top and standard rates of tax by 2 per cent.  It must also be borne in mind that average growth in incomes has increased and that there are greater numbers of people at work due to the high economic growth of recent years.  The average rate of tax paid by single and married people in the tax year 1998/9 will fall considerably as opposed to 1996/7.  I have pointed out these facts on a number of occasions and I do so again. The Government intends to implement the objectives of An Action Programme for the Millennium over its five year term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that focusing on cutting the top rate of tax from 48 per cent to 46 per cent confers undue benefit on the big punter as against the small punter?  By failing to put resources into bands and allowances it has the same effect.  Would he not agree that a consistent theme running through his tenure as Minister for Finance, in relation to the Ansbacher accounts as opposed to the treatment of the credit unions, for example, is that he has favoured the big punter over the small one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that as a load of nonsense.  The budget debate about rich and poor revolves around the following: is a single person earning £13,000 poor as opposed to a single person earning £15,000?  Is the married couple earning £27,000 deemed rich?  That is the kind of debate we are having.  The total tax concessions in the budget were of the order of £517 million. Of that figure, £104 million, 20 per cent, represented the adjustments to the top rate of income tax.  I have rebutted these arguments on many occasions and I hear them repeated now by the Deputy and others.  I do not blame them for doing so as I am aware that there are events taking <Col N="18" /> place north and south of this House within the next week and I would not expect the Deputy to say anything else.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that despite his assertions, all the expert groups on poverty and ICTU have stated that the budget was misguided in cutting the top rate of tax as against putting the resources into widening the standard rate band and increasing personal allowances?  Would he not accept that, as his own figures indicate, 37 per cent of taxpayers previously paid tax at the standard rate but 38.2 per cent will do so after his budget?  We are moving in the opposite direction to the Government's commitment.  Would the Minister not accept that the consensus outside the House is not part of political propaganda from this side of the House but an acknowledgment that the Fianna Fáil-PD alliance favours the rich to the virtual exclusion of the average worker?</P>

I totally reject all the other contentions made by the Deputy.  I also reject the nonsense by some of the leading lobbyists in this area that there is only one way to reduce taxation.

As I stated on that occasion, the Government authorised me to enter into consultations with the boards, management and staff of the ACC and ICC banks with a view to developing detailed proposals on their future structure and ownership in a way which would recognise the interests of all stakeholders, including the taxpayer.  I held meetings with the management and staff in the banks on 8 December 1997 and there are continuing contacts between my officials and the bank management and staff unions.  I am currently awaiting formal submissions from the staff unions in both banks.  I expect to receive these shortly, at which stage I will assess the position with a view to bringing definitive proposals before the Government.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he is satisfied that the practice of the marketing of products with similar effects is not common in the financial sector in view of the alleged tax evasion schemes being marketed by National Irish Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5808/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the marketing of particular financial products would reside, if at all, with the Central Bank and, in the case of tax evasion, with the Revenue Commissioners in so far as such data comes to their attention in the course of their operations.  On 26 January last I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank requesting him to clarify the position in so far as it might relate to exchange controls.  I also asked him to report to me separately on the implications, if any, for all aspects of banking supervision.  The Governor responded to me on 28 January to the effect that he is having these issues investigated and will report to me as soon as possible.  To date, I have not received an interim or preliminary report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the examination and pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  This is the position which has applied &mdash; it has been accepted in the House &mdash; since the foundation of the State.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in individual cases.  However, I assure the House that the investigations are proceeding as a matter of priority.  As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I have asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the adequacy of Revenue powers following the report of the McCracken tribunal.  I have also said that if additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, then proposals to enhance Revenue's powers will be brought forward.  However, before taking such an initiative it will be necessary to have all the relevant information from the series of inquiries currently under way.  The Moriarty tribunal is specifically charged with making recommendations on banking <Col N="22" /> supervision, the protection of State revenue and offshore accounts.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, for the benefit of the House I would not rule out new provisions if they were shown to be necessary, for example, to require financial institutions to report to Revenue where they become aware that financial products sold by them may facilitate tax evasion or to notify Revenue where funds have been transferred in certain circumstances to or from particular off-shore locations.  There may also be new powers for Revenue to access bank accounts where there are reasonable grounds to believe that certain accounts are being or may be used in a tax evasion scheme.  Any such proposals would need to be very carefully examined to ensure they would be effective, could not be easily circumvented, would not needlessly disrupt the affairs of law abiding taxpayers and would be proportionate in their effect on the financial sector when measured against the problem to be tackled.</P>
    <P>A responsible Government would need to have as much information as possible by way of answer to these issues before it acted.  That is why I have taken such an approach.  Caution and care should not be confused with indifference or indolence in these matters.  The Opposition seems to want to rush in with unspecified and unlimited powers.  I have to take a more responsible approach which, in the end, will better secure the welfare of ordinary citizens of the State and its revenues.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt about the Government's determination to combat tax evasion and avoidance.  The Finance Bill, 1998, contains a number of new provisions for this purpose and I made further announcements at the weekend clamping down on new avoidance schemes.  I will not hesitate to take further action as the need arises, be it increasing the powers of the Revenue Commissioners or implementing other measures that are likely to be effective.</P>

      <P>Does it strike the Minister as strange that so many Irish commercial banks have branches in the Isle of Man?  Because of this product and its association with the Isle of Man, will the Minister examine the need for a wider investigation into other banks?  The products were marketed as non-resident accounts but belonged to residents, in effect making them bogus.  It was clear Revenue was going to clamp down on them and an alternative was, therefore, being sought.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister not read the media comments which alleged the Taoiseach was angry, upset and annoyed by this provision and the manner in which it became part of the Finance Bill?  If Cabinet procedures were fully followed, with the provisions of the Bill being endorsed by it, does he not think the Taoiseach or his spindoctors were engaged in serious hypocrisy and humbug in trying to distance himself from the odium and leaving the Minister out to dry?  Has he made any inquiries as to the source of these leaks and spins that have made him the sole author of this as opposed to suggesting collective Cabinet responsibility?</P>

      <P>Why were the proposals that appear in the Finance Bill, which I presume will be deleted when we reach Committee Stage, not included in the advance statement issued by the Minister's Department at the end of January since we have to address the actual position?  I do not expect the Minister to tell us where we expect to be this time next year but does he believe it is reasonable or fair that dividends from credit union shares should be taxable at the standard rate of tax of 24 per cent or at the marginal rate of tax of 46 per cent whereas bank deposits were chargeable on a DIRT rate of 20 per cent, or 15 per cent until last December?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is bringing back ghosts from the past.  He sounds very much like the Irish League of Credit Unions whose members came to see me in the middle of December with regard to putting DIRT on credit <Col N="26" /> union interest.  In the argument they put forward, which I accepted at the time, they said credit union interest is taxed at the marginal rate.  There is a section on every person's income tax form, be they self-employed or in paid employment, which refers to credit union interest in relation to listing deposit interest.  The Deputy is correct.  Credit union interest and dividends are taxed at the marginal rate and the Irish League of Credit Unions put forward an argument to have certain changes made.  The matter became lost in the confusion that arose on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 12, 13 and 14 February.  It was somewhat redressed in the commentary in the Sunday newspaper that weekend.  There was not an anomaly regarding dividends.  There is no institution in the State which does not declare its dividends.  If a person has a special savings account and it is subject to DIRT, that is the end of that person's tax liability as far as the interest is concerned.  Normal DIRT interest must be declared but not special savings account interest.  All these matters will be addressed when the working group reports by 30 September.  As of now, the position remains as it was in that interest and dividends from credit unions are subject to tax.</P>

It simply was not possible to conclude these amendments at that stage.  There was no other reason.  It probably would have been better to publish it at that time so that the Irish League of Credit Unions could have done its song and dance then and not when the Finance Bill was published.

Until the Irish League of Credit Unions approached me &mdash; its leaders will accept this as fact &mdash; I had no intention to do anything about any matter relating to credit unions.  I told the lobbyist who approached me to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions that there was no point in such a meeting because I did not have any proposals for the Finance Bill.

I can guarantee the Minister that 1,850,000 credit union customers did not agree with them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Meetings are held between the social partners, including Government representatives, on a regular basis to discuss implementation of the Partnership 2000 agreement.  Social consensus has been a very significant factor in the success of our economy.  Pay moderation linked to tax reductions and increased resources in the social area, coupled with reform of the public finances, has given us the stable economic environment in which investment could take place and employment could grow.  Social consensus has been a significant factor in keeping inflation at moderate levels in the past decade, falling as low as 1.5 per cent in the past two years.</P>
      <P>At recent meetings between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the social partners, all issues relevant to Partnership 2000 were discussed, including prospects for inflation.  I am satisfied the combination of moderate pay increases linked to significant reductions in taxes under Partnership 2000 will contribute to the maintenance of sound economic conditions.  Both my Department and I, in the context of our normal regular contact with the Central Bank, have discussed the prospects for the economy, including inflation.  I recognise that potential inflationary pressures exist in the economy.  However, current speculation about a significant increase in inflation is overstated and does not take adequate account of the complexities of likely market developments over the coming year.</P>
      <P>My Department's forecasts for 1998, published on 3 December 1997 in the Economic Background to the Budget, projected a CPI increase of 2 per cent.  This and other relevant forecasts will be reviewed at mid-year and the results will be published in the 1998 Economic Review and Outlook.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm the original forecast by the Department for inflation this year was about 2.25 per cent and forecasts are now emanating from the Central Bank of about <Col N="29" /> 5 per cent?  In this context what impact will inflationary figures have in striking the rate at which Ireland will join EMU?  Will a short-term inflationary concern, in conjunction with the Central Bank forecast, be a factor in striking the rate at which we will join EMU, or will the long-term competitive advantage outweigh that?  On the CPI, is the Minister aware asset-based inflation &mdash; house prices increased by 90 per cent in the past year &mdash; is not part of the equation in working out the CPI and does he believe this matter needs to be reviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the Deputy and people outside the House &mdash; I have seen at least one other commentary which made this assertion &mdash; it is not correct that the Central Bank projected inflation at 5.5 per cent by the end of the year.  That projection was made by an independent university economist who used a Central Bank model.  In regard to asset-based inflation, that is not taken into account in the CPI.  The CPI would be affected only if interest rates increase or decrease.  Studies have been undertaken abroad on building asset inflation into a general index, but an attempt to do so in the United States was not successful.  It has not been tried in Ireland or, as far as I am aware, in other EC countries.</P>
      <P>On the bilateral exchange rate at which Ireland will join the EMU, as I pointed out on many occasions, that decision will be made during the first weekend in May when a pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates between participating countries will be made.  All aspects, including inflation, will be taken into account in making that decision.  For obvious good and sound reasons, I have steadfastly refused to speculate or give an indication of my thinking in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in saying the Central Bank has not made a projection of 5 or 5.5 per cent, but the Governor of the Central Bank recently made a projection of 3 per cent, 50 per cent higher than the Department's projection in December.  Does the Minister agree with that projection and, if so, is he concerned about it?  If he does not agree with it, will he give the reason?</P>

The outturn at 1.5 per cent as measured by the CPI or 1.2 per cent as measured by the HICP were well below the projections of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and other independent analysts at the beginning of 1997.  The projection by the Department of Finance at budget time for the average inflation rate for 1998 was 1.0 per cent. In mid-year that forecast will be revised.  I have no grounds for revising it at this stage and it would be foolish to do so.</P>

      <P>Most Members will agree that some of the hype about inflation in the early weeks of January this year was misguided.  Some of it was deliberately engendered by vested interests who wanted to give cover to the fact that they were going to increase prices.  The figures for January and February have not borne out their contention.  These matters will be kept under review.  I re-emphasise it is necessary in present economic conditions to keep inflation as low as possible because the people who will lose out when inflation rises, as we have seen in the past 20 years, are those on fixed incomes such as social welfare recipients.  The responsible attitude adopted by trade unions and the social partners in taking the partnership approach has kept inflation at very low levels and that has helped economic growth while at the same time protecting people on fixed incomes, particularly social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>It would be foolish to speculate on what will happen regarding inflation.  It would also be foolish to speculate on the various matters raised by the Deputy.  Increases of at least 3 per cent were provided for in the budget to all those covered under social welfare.  They were considerably higher for old age pensioners.  At the beginning of the year my Department projected that the inflation rate for the year would be 2.0 per cent.  The rate has not yet approached that level.  The social welfare increases provided for <Col N="31" /> by the Deputy when he was Minister for Social Welfare in the previous Administration were considerably in excess of the rate of inflation.

This would be a way of stopping imported inflation.  It is not unreasonable to speculate on how this would balance against the need to sustain long-term competitiveness for our exports by locking into EMU at a lower value. The Minister may say that these matters will be considered in the first weekend in May.

The value of a residence or part of a residence inherited from a sibling residing in the same residence can now be reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser, as opposed to 60 per cent or £80,000, whichever was the lesser.  I also announced a new inheritance tax relief for those inheriting their principal <Col N="32" /> private residence from a close relative.  This new relief also allows the value of a residence or part of a residence inherited to be reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000 for capital acquisitions tax purposes.  These measures were taken to alleviate the position of elderly brothers and sisters and other close relatives who may face a large tax charge on inheriting their family home.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above reliefs the transfer of agricultural and business assets by gift or inheritance can avail of up to 90 per cent capital acquisitions tax relief, subject to certain conditions being met.

The former Minister, Deputy Quinn, made significant changes to the capital acquisitions tax in previous budgets with regard to business relief, which also applies to farmers.

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Ring &mdash; the plans, if any, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has to regulate or prevent public demonstrations on the main streets in Dublin and whether a section of Phoenix Park could be used instead; (2) Deputy Durkan &mdash; the response to Parliamentary Question No. 177 on 24 February 1998 about the assessment of income tax of a person in County Kildare; (3) Deputy McGennis &mdash; the up to date position regarding the provision of independent counsel to represent rape victims at criminal trials; the legislative or other changes necessary to implement this measure; and the probable time scale; (4) Deputy Stanton &mdash; the need to introduce guidelines which prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives involving schools where the promotions are linked to parents making purchases of the sponsors' goods, products or services; (5) Deputy McManus &mdash; the reasons the State did not contest a legal case taken by a Dublin consultant challenging part of the findings of the Finlay Tribunal of Inquiry, especially in the light of assurances given to Positive Action and the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 20 March 1997 and in particular why the State did not seek to have the tribunal reconvened to consider the matters at issue; (6) Deputy John Gormley &mdash; the latest Environmental Protection Agency's figures for air pollution in Dublin, and the need to tackle the problem of VOC's and PM 10's in Dublin's air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter at length on Committee Stage and I do not want to repeat what was said then.  I want to highlight one or two points I omitted to make on Committee Stage.  This is an attempt to amend section 5 which sets out various functions of the Central Bank and, in particular, the additional functions being imposed on it by our membership of the euro zone and of the European Central Bank.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are taken substantially from article 105(5) of the third protocol of the Maastricht Treaty which states that the ESCB shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.  In essence, I want to know why that reference was taken out of the Bill.  I know the contents of the Bill have been negotiated with the European Monetary Institute and to a large extent reflect the third protocol of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 allows the Minister to be informed on issues which concern the regulation of the financial supervision function of the Central Bank.  We discussed this matter in a somewhat different context on Committee Stage, in terms of the Minister being consulted.  He is entitled to be consulted under the Bill and under previous Central Bank Acts in relation to non-ECB related matters.  As article 105, to which I referred, is an ECB and an ESCB related matter I propose that the Minister should be informed rather than consulted.  This is slightly different from the discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was happy to have the debate on Committee Stage on the basis of subsection (4).  I am now proposing it, as I had originally intended, on the basis of subsection (2) which refers to information.  Information is constrained simply to ESCB related matters.  The wording is contained in Article 105(5) of the Maastricht Treaty and it is, therefore, an ESCB related matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) provides for the Minister for Finance's right to be informed about the banks monitoring policy role within the European system of central banks and the European Central Bank.  Subsection (4), however, provides for the Minister's right to be consulted in relation to all of the bank's other functional duties, including the licensing and supervision of financial institutions as provided for under law.  I am assuming the Deputy would prefer if the Minister could be consulted rather than merely informed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the execution and performance of these functions and duties which are conferred on the bank under Acts of the Oireachtas.  On the substance of the Deputy's amendments, I pointed out on Committee Stage that a proposed new subsection (2) relates to the objectives of the bank other than the primary objective of price stability as set out in the proposed new subsection (1).  These other objectives include contributing to the stability of the financial system, promoting the efficient and effective operation of payment and settlement systems and discharging any other duties conferred on it by law.  The bank has statutory duties in relation to the licensing and supervision of certain financial institutions and payments systems.  The wording of the proposed subsection (2) is sufficient to cover the objectives underlying these duties and, therefore, adequate to cover the intent behind Deputy McDowell's amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the wording in the proposed new subsection (4) is adequate to cover the intent behind Deputy McDowell's amendment No. 2.  However, the Minister would have the right to be consulted on the performance by the bank of all its non ESCB related statutory functions, including those related to licensing and supervision.  As became apparent during the discussions <Col N="52" /> on Committee Stage, the Deputy's intention is that the Minister for Finance should be consulted regularly by the Central Bank in connection with what the bank has found out about individual cases.  I am not prepared to go down that road.  Such a measure would require a significant and fundamental change in Central Bank practice and is something to which the Legislature will have to give long and hard thought.</P>
    <P>Under the wording of section 5, the Minister will be able to be consulted on all of the bank's non-ESCB activities.  This will include consultations on the general supervisory functions of the bank, for example, in relation to whether it has sufficient powers in legislation to carry out its duties but will not include consultation on the affairs of a supervised entity unless that entity has consented to the disclosure of information by the bank.  This is in line with the bank's confidentiality regime as set out in section 16 of the Central Bank Act, l989.  In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a difficulty in that the Minister anticipated we would have a similar, if not exactly the same, debate as on Committee Stage.  On that occasion he suggested, and repeated today, that I might have intended to do something slightly different from what was in the amendment.  I accepted that and was happy to have a debate on that basis on Committee Stage. I have now reverted to the somewhat more modest content of the amendment as proposed on Committee Stage which would entitle the Minister merely to be informed.  The reason for this is that the &ldquo;prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system&rdquo; is the phrase used in the protocol to the Treaty. For some reason, which I do not understand, the phrase &ldquo;supervision of credit institutions&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill.  Why have those words been excised, I presume deliberately, in negotiations with the EMI?  I accept that prudential supervision of the credit institutions is an issue in which the European systems of central banks and the European Central Bank have a role and, therefore, that the Minister could not properly be consulted without us being in breach of our duties under the third protocol.  It could still be possible for the Minister to be informed on these matters, as he is entitled to be informed on all other ECB and ESCB matters.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy pressing amendment No. 1?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to press it but not to call a vote.  The European system of central banks has a specific role under the Treaty because Article 105(5) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> The ESCB shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.</P>
    <P>Why has that section about the prudential supervision of credit institutions been taken out of the Bill?  The Minister is right in saying the primary reason I want this is that it is important the Minister should be entitled to have some information and that there should be some supervision of the way in which the Central Bank discharges these important functions, particularly when the currency effectively ceases to exist at the end of the year and many of the functions of the Central Bank will become redundant.  The regulatory role will then become all the more important.  We have seen plenty examples in recent weeks of where the regulatory and supervisory role of the Central Bank is extremely important and it is being broadened all the time.</P>
    <P>I expressed some doubts and concerns on Committee Stage on whether the Central Bank is equipped to discharge the full regulatory role we are giving it and which we are broadening to include investment intermediaries.  When responding perhaps the Minister would address the issue of whether he is satisfied the bank has the resources &mdash; the personnel, expertise and wherewithal, not merely the legal power &mdash; to discharge all the various functions being given to the bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no indication from the Governor or the Board of the Central Bank that they are short of resources in any of these areas.  If either the Governor or the board were to make demands for resources they would be considered.  The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to have a supervisory role in all the various financial institutions.  Nothing will change in that regard.  The European Central Bank does not have a specific role in those matters unless it were to be given such a role by the Council.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 42, after &ldquo;Treaty&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the Bank shall have regard to the desirability of attaining a high level of employment and in particular the Bank shall have regard to the provisions of Title VIa of the Treaty establishing the European Community as inserted by Article 2.19 of the Treaty done at Amsterdam on 2nd day of October, l997&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment specifically seeks to broaden the economic remit of the Central Bank beyond the understandable priority that is given to price stability.  The Minister rightly pointed out that the amendment refers to the Treaty done at Amsterdam <Col N="54" /> which has not yet been ratified.  I have no difficulty in excising the reference to the Treaty done at Amsterdam, if that is what the Minister wants.  However, we should put employment at the centre of economic policy of the Union.  I said on Second Stage that employment is probably the one single element of economic policy which touches on virtually all citizens of the European Union, particularly as there are four million people unemployed in Germany and there is civil unrest in France related to unemployment.  It is important that the institutions of the Union including ECOFIN and the Central Bank should be seen to be responsive to this problem.  We are in a difficulty if we create in the Central Bank an enormously powerful institution, more powerful than any single national Government, in terms of maintaining and driving forward the economic policy of the Union and of individual states.</P>
    <P>If we create an institution which is not accountable to anybody, we will be in difficulty.  If its economic remit is to be limited to monetary policy, money flow, interest rates and the external exchange rate, we will be in particular difficulty. The amendment focuses on the importance given to employment in the appropriate chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty and regards it as an important economic aim of the Central Bank and the European Union as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection which the Deputy proposes to amend was amended by me on Committee Stage.  The new wording is the result of a recent direct approach to me by Commissioner de Silguy, the commissioner in charge of the directorate responsible for producing the Commission's report on the compatibility of national central bank legislation with the Treaty. The wording of the amendment has been the subject of consultation with the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute.</P>
      <P>Commission de Silguy's concerns relate to the wording of the subsection in the Bill, as published, in that it provided that &ldquo;the Bank shall act in the interests of the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  This text was originally in section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which provides that a general function of the bank shall be to take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard the currency.  This duty, however, is qualified by the provision that &ldquo;the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  The purpose of section 5 of the Bill is to replace section 6 of the 1942 Act to take account of the fact that monetary policy will be the preserve of the European Central Bank post-EMU.</P>
      <P>Article 105 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the European system of central banks, of which the Central Bank of Ireland will be part, &ldquo;shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2&rdquo;.  Article 2 of the Treaty provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The Community has the task of promoting a harmonious and balanced development of economic growth, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment, a high degree of convergence of economic performance, a high level of employment and of social protection, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States.</P>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, the Government believes that the sentiments in Article 2 of the Treaty are fully consistent with the Central Bank's role whereby, in relation to monetary policy, it must have regard to the welfare of the people and, therefore, it acceded to the commissioner's request that section 5(6) of the Bill be replaced with the wording of Article 105 of the Treaty.  This was achieved by my amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As for the inclusion of a general reference to the Central Bank having regard to the desirability of attaining a high level of employment, Article 2 of the Treaty sets out the European Union's objectives to which the Central Bank, as a member of the ESCB, shall have a role in contributing. The Article states that &ldquo;the Community has the task of promoting . a high level of employment and of social protection&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The wording of the subsection, as amended by me on Committee Stage, is adequate and consistent with the transfer of monetary policy to the European Central Bank post EMU.  It is the result of extensive examination and discussion with the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty.  Before the Minister amended subsection (6) it included the phrase &ldquo;the interests of the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  As far as I am aware, this was borrowed from the social protocol to Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1942.  To say the least, it is perverse to include a provision in the Bill, as published, and then delete it on Committee Stage, particularly given its anodyne nature.  I am at a loss to understand the advice of the European Monetary Institute that such a phrase could conceivably be inimical to our duties under the Maastricht Treaty.  It is bizarre that should be the case.</P>

I find this strange.  It confirms people's worst fears about the Central Bank. While it will have to have regard to monetary policy, money flow, interest rates and the external exchange rate, it may disregard everything else. That is the message that is being sent.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McDowell proposed a drafting amendment to simplify the reference to the Treaty in section 16 of the Bill.  As agreed, I have considered this point in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.  The Deputy's point is taken and the parliamentary draftsman advises that the reference to the Treaty can be simplified further.  Section 12 inserts a complete definition of &ldquo;the Treaty&rdquo; into the Central Bank Act, 1989.  Accordingly, this amendment reduces the reference to the Treaty to its simplest form in the interests of clarity.  This meets the Deputy's concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> In page 11, after line 30, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;21.  &mdash; Section 16(2)(a) of the Act of 1989 is hereby amended by the insertion, after &lsquo;proceedings&rsquo;, of the following:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;or by a tribunal to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1997, have been applied pursuant to a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rsquo;.&rdquo;.4</P>
    <P>This issue was the subject of a lengthy debate on Committee Stage.  I will summarise the argument I made.  While the Central Bank is allowed in certain circumstances to disclose information, specifically to a court of law in criminal proceedings, it is not allowed to disclose information to a tribunal established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The effect of the amendment would be to allow the Central Bank to co-operate with and disclose information to a tribunal established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am not proposing this in a vacuum.  There are currently two tribunals operating under authority given to them by the Oireachtas.  I do not know, and it would be wrong to speculate, whether they want any information from the Central Bank or if it has information that could be of use to them.  Given the subject matter of those tribunals, it is by no means inconceivable that there could be such information.  It is important for the purposes of those tribunals and for future purposes that the bank should be given power and should have a duty to co-operate with tribunals set up by the Oireachtas in these types of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I invited the Minister, on Committee Stage, to reconsider Article 12, paragraph 7 of the 1989 banking directive which allows the central banks of member states to disclose information in certain circumstances.  It includes two inspectors acting on behalf of those departments.  The Minister suggested on Committee Stage that he would examine the intended application of paragraph 7. There was some suggestion that it might refer only to insurance cases, but that is not my reading of the directive and I would be interested to hear if the Minister has anything further to add in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is subject to strict confidentiality requirements.  These are set out in section 16 of the 1989 Central Bank Act and subsequent amendments.  Section 16 introduced provisions related to the disclosure of information by the bank's staff, similar to those already existing for public servants in relation to the prevention of corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the section provides that the governor, a director, officer or servant of the bank may not disclose information related to the business of any person or body, whether corporate or incorporate, which came to his knowledge by virtue of his office of employment, or the bank's activities in respect of the protection of the integrity of the currency or the control of credit unless <Col N="58" /> such disclosure is to enable the bank to carry out its functions under the Central Bank Acts.  As the bank did not conduct exchange control activities under these Acts, this confidentiality regime does not apply to these activities.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the disclosure of information as required by a court in connection with criminal proceedings.  In addition, the bank, under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, may disclose to the gardaí, where it has reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.  Further, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the gardaí a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering or certain related offences.  Such offences would include tax evasion in relation to the proceeds of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Penalties for contravention of the provisions of section 16 are: on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £25,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. These secrecy provisions are vital in the maintenance of the financial sector's confidence in the bank and, in turn, the public's confidence in the operation of the financial sector.</P>
    <P>Irish law on confidentiality in financial supervision implements European Union law which requires a high degree of professional secrecy. Article 12 of the First Council Directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure that the Central Bank maintains very strict confidentiality.  The Office of the Attorney General has been consulted on this issue and has advised that the directive, while allowing certain exceptions, does not permit the proceedings of a tribunal to come within the exceptions prescribed.  Although European law does, as an exception, permit the giving of information by the Central Bank of Ireland in connection with legal proceedings, rules of law emanating from the directive and Ireland's obligations under the Treaty would prevent adoption of a provision which would widen the existing categories of exceptions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Central Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, any legislation purporting to extend the present categories of exceptions to the bank's confidentiality regime would, <i>prima facie</i>, be <i>ultra vires</i> the directive and the EU Treaty. Confidentiality is a core element of effective financial regulation and, as such, is deeply embedded in the body not only of EU law but of international law generally.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Deputy referred to Article 16.7 of the Second Banking Directive as a possible provision which would allow me to amend section 16 of the 1989 Act to allow disclosure by the bank of information to a tribunal of inquiry.  Article 16.7 provides that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> .a Member State may, by virtue of provisions laid down by law, authorise the disclosure of certain information to other departments of their central government administrations responsible for legislation on the supervision of credit institutions, financial institutions, investment services and insurance companies and to inspectors acting on behalf of those departments.  However, such disclosures may be made only where necessary for reasons of prudential control.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Article 16.7 does not allow the disclosure of information to an entity other than one which is a central Government Department which has responsibility for legislation on the supervision of financial institutions.  Also, such disclosure is restricted on the grounds that it can be for prudential supervision purposes only.  An example in an Irish context would be the disclosure of information by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for supervising the insurance industry, to the Central Bank, which has responsibility for supervising banking groups which contain insurance companies.  In the circumstances I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely persuaded by the last part of the Minister's response.  It is Article 12.7 rather than Article l6.7 and we are speaking about section 16.  The exact wording given by the Minister is correct and it allows for disclosure to departments of their central Government administrations responsible for legislation on the supervision of credit institutions.  In relation to issues concerning only prudential control, will the Minister confirm if that includes the Department of Finance which would typically draft the legislation that governs this area?  To use a hypothesis not too far removed from what we have experienced, if the Central Bank were concerned that a relatively small number of depositors held an excessive amount of deposits, say a third or quarter of the amount on deposit in a bank, there would be a potential risk for that bank in terms of prudential control if all those relatively small number of depositors suddenly withdrew their money.  Is the Central Bank, in exercising its supervisory role, at liberty to inform the Department of the central government, perhaps the Department of Finance and presumably the Minister for Finance, in regard to <Col N="60" /> its concerns?  Can it disclose information in relation to that?</P>
      <P>We are talking in terms of the banking directive.  Irrespective of whether that is permitted under the banking directive, it seems to be prohibited by section 16 of the 1989 Act.  I am sure the Minister would acknowledge the Opposition will have considerable difficulty attempting to amend this Bill because all of its provisions appear to have been agreed with the EMI and are seriously circumscribed by the protocol to the Treaty and by the banking directives.  I accept that, but that means we must study the banking directives and ascertain if it is possible to be a little more flexible with our legislation to incorporate what appear to be acceptable wordings from the directives.  That is why I picked that paragraph of the article of the directive.  Paragraph 7 of Article 16 appears to allow a somewhat more liberal regime of disclosure than appears to have been permissible under our Central Bank Acts.  If we can go no further than that without the agreement of the EMI, surely we can go that far?</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised a number of specific questions.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Deputy's question about whether the Central Bank could notify the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance of any of the matters he raised.  It would be the job of the Central Bank to sort out those matters.  There is no provision for it to approach the Department of Finance to advise it of those matters.  The Central Bank would approach the Minister for Finance only to request additional powers in a legislative context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to have approached this matter with the free spirit one might have hoped.  I am looking to push out the boundaries of disclosure as far as possible without going outside the scope of what will be permissible under the new regime into which we are getting and I am sorry the Minister is unable to do this.  This gives rise, probably unjustly, to unnecessary suspicion that the Central Bank is being prevented and discouraged from giving information and from co-operating with tribunals set up by the Oireachtas.  If a tribunal is set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas to investigate a matter, it is incumbent on us to ensure it has the maximum possible power to do so.  In the context of this Bill, we should seek to oblige the Central Bank to disclose information and to co-operate with tribunals set up in that way.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>21.  -(1) The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, shall apply to the Bank as if it stood prescribed pursuant to regulations made by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of paragraph 1(5) of the First Schedule to that Act.</P>
      <P> (2) This section shall come into operation on the day that is one year from the date of passing of this Act.&rdquo;.4</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to extend to the Central Bank the Freedom of Information Act passed by the House in 1997.  I accepted on Committee Stage that many of the day to day workings of the Central Bank are covered by the prohibition on disclosure and that many of its legal and statutory obligations may not be disclosed by reason of section 16, about which we had a lengthy discussion.  This amendment, if accepted, would have <Col N="63" /> a relatively restricted application and would most likely apply to the day to day decision making and administrative procedures within the bank.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act lists the Government Departments and semi-State bodies to which the Act immediately applies.  It goes on to specify that the Act shall come into effect for local authorities and health boards 18 months after it has been passed, which should be October this year.  The Schedule also allows Ministers with specific responsibility for certain institutions to extend by way of regulation the application of the Act to those institutions.  A significant number of institutions would be covered and the Central Bank is one over which the Minister for Finance would have power in the sense that he would be the Minister responsible for making the regulations.  I seek by way of this amendment to have the Minister make the regulations to extend the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>From 21 April next, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 will apply to the public bodies listed in the First Schedule of the Act.  These bodies comprise Government Departments and, for the most part, public bodies which are wholly or primarily staffed by civil servants and whose functions are closely aligned with those of their parent Government Department. Paragraph 1(5) of the First Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act provides that any body established by or under any enactment shall be brought under the scope of the Act pursuant to regulations made by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the appropriate Minister.  It was always intended to use this mechanism to widen application of the Act in an incremental fashion across the wider public service.  However, I have no plans at present to apply this provision to the bank.  The Deputy is aware and accepts that in such circumstances the existing confidentiality regime of the Central Bank would still apply under the terms of sections 26 and 32 of the Freedom of Information Act.  As I said on Committee Stage, I have no objection in principle to the Central Bank coming under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.  I would see this happening over a period of time in accordance with the incremental approach being adopted.  I will bear the Deputy's views in mind in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeated the response he gave on Committee Stage.  I thought that his response was informed by his belief that I was looking to use this issue as a Trojan horse to get at information about other matters.  I protest my innocence.  I am trying to persuade the Minister that my intentions were benign and were looking to the longer term.  There is a danger that we will put the Act on the Statute Book and forget about it.  It is important that it is extended as <Col N="64" /> quickly and effectively as possible to all public bodies.  The Minister says that he has no objection in principle to extending the Act, so why is he not doing so?  Why can he not tell the House that he will do so at some future stage?  Are there any circumstances which suggest he should delay?  Why can we not move ahead as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>We all accept that, like the Civil Service, public bodies will need time to adapt procedures so that they will be able to provide information required by the public, lobby groups or politicians.  The regulations would allow the Central Bank such time.  We are discussing the Central Bank but will the Minister give a general indication of other institutions which come under his remit and which would look to him to make regulations of this kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that I have no objection in principle to extending the Freedom of Information Act to the Central Bank.  It will happen in time.  The provisions of that Act come into play on 21 April.  The Government and its predecessor took the approach that the Act would be extended to other bodies over a period of time.  Let us see how it will operate from 21 April.  The Deputy will admit that this amendment is not necessary in the Central Bank Bill. The incremental approach to bringing bodies under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act will take some time.  Hopefully it will be a relatively short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not found it possible to accept this uncontroversial amendment.  We do not often get the opportunity to debate issues such as the workings of the Central Bank.  Our adherence to the euro and the ECB have given us such an opportunity and I thought it would be useful to consider not just those aspects of the bank's role which relate to the European Central Bank and the euro but also to look at other aspects of its regulation and the information we receive about how it does its job.</P>
      <P>As a result of the independence we have given the Central Bank, I hope that, in time, the bank and the governor will be more vocal about our economic policy.  I hope that we will have a position where the governor will not feel constrained to automatically parrot everything coming from officials of the Department of Finance or the Minister, as is already the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governor of the Central Bank is independent and it is a gross insult to imply otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard the governor say anything that was inconsistent with what was being said by the Department of Finance.  Perhaps that is likely to be the case in so far as the bank, the Department and the Minister <Col N="65" /> are working from the same hymn sheet.  In Germany, the Bundesbank and the Government, the two centres of economic policy making, do not always say the same thing.  This is healthy.  It contributes to public debate and we should encourage a similar practice here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the implication to remain on the record of the House that the current Governor of the Central Bank or any of his predecessors ever parroted what came from the Minister or the Department of Finance.  The Governor and the Central Bank are completely independent of the Department of Finance, the Minister and the Government.  It would be incorrect to allow the allegation to remain on the record of the House and I reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister is saying.  In general, the Governor and the Minister have spoken from the same hymn sheet. That is likely when we have something approaching consensus on how we drive economic policy. I am not being especially critical of that practice. It is inevitable and I am not suggesting that the governor is not exercising his functions independently or looking to parrot the Minister's comments.  I appreciate the opportunity the Minister has given me to clarify that point.  However, perhaps because of the closeness of the two institutions and the way in which they have grown over the years, it is inevitable that they should give a similar line.  That is part of our history and it is not necessarily bad.  However, that is likely to change in the future given the manner in which the Minister has reconstituted the bank as entirely independent.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the bank is independent.  That is not entirely true.  There is a mechanism for consultation with the Minister.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance is a member of the board of the Central Bank and there is a close relationship, which has generally been positive.  I do not want to criticise them but there is a greater likelihood in the future that the two central Departments which drive our economic policy will give somewhat different views in public.  I accept that this is not specifically related to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> It is an honour for me to move the Second Reading of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, which was published on 27 January.  From the outset the Government's objective in this Bill was to ask the people to give the State sufficient powers to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam and to implement its provisions as a member state of the European Union.  To this end, the Government undertook a thorough legal examination of the treaty and of the powers which should be sought from the people to achieve its objective.</P>
    <P>On the areas of the treaty related to free movement, Ireland secured, in negotiation, a number of opt-outs with the possibility of opting-in on certain conditions.  The treaty also contains general provisions on &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; or flexibility pursuant to which obligations may be entered into by a number of member states short of full membership under the First and Third Pillars.  Flexibility does not apply in the Second Pillar, which concerns the common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>The view was expressed that the addition of a single sentence to the Constitution stating simply that the State may ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam &mdash; the formulation used to ratify the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht &mdash; would have been the best way to proceed. However, the legal advice given to the Government was that this formulation on its own could generate intolerable uncertainty over the State's ability to implement the flexibility provisions of the treaty and to exercise the opting-in rights secured in the negotiations.  We concluded that a licence from the people to the State to ratify the treaty, and no more, would not suffice.</P>
    <P>The Government will move a Committee Stage amendment to the proposed Article 29.4.6 in the Bill as published.  The amendment reflects the fact that the specific articles and protocols of the new treaty which it identifies contain options and discretions.  The modified wording does not prejudice, and is not intended to prejudice, any other provisions of the treaty which are, of course, covered by the proposed Article 29.4.5. In particular, the revised subsection 6 has no implications for the common foreign and security policy provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment Article 29.4.6 shall read:</P>
    <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by or under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 5 of this section and the second and fourth Protocols set out in the said Treaty but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The proposed wording of Article 29.4.5 shall remain unchanged from that published in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Article 1.11 covers police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, while Article 2.5 allows for &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; under normal Community business, known as the First Pillar and <Col N="68" /> Article 2.15 inserts a new Title IIIa into the EC Treaty and covers visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons.</P>
    <P>The second protocol sets out how the Schengen arrangements are to be integrated into the framework of the European Union.  It provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that Ireland or the United Kingdom or both countries, who have not signed up to the Schengen agreements, may at any time request to take part in some or all of Schengen.  The Council will decide on such a request.  The fourth protocol establishes the position of the State in relation to Article 2.15. Ireland and the UK are exempt from the provisions of the new Title IIIa as long as they maintain the common travel area arrangements, although they may either together or individually opt in to specific measures.  Ireland has stated in a declaration to the Final Act that it intends to exercise its right to take part in the adoption of measures under Title IIIa to the maximum extent compatible with maintenance of the common travel area.</P>
    <P>The modified wording, which the Government will formally introduce as an amendment to the published Bill on Committee Stage, provides for prior parliamentary approval for the exercise of options or discretions.  There is a general welcome for this amendment.  I also welcome the endorsement of the modified wording by the three parties which formed the previous Government following a lengthy, detailed and helpful round of discussions.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam will help to equip the European Union, internally and externally, to address the challenges of the new millennium.  It provides the necessary basis to allow the process of further enlargement to go ahead.  It will make it possible for the Union to address more effectively the concerns of citizens.  The support of the Irish people for the Treaty will confirm Ireland's role as a full and active participant in the development of the Union.</P>
    <P>The treaty represents the outcome of the intergovernmental conference, provided for in the Maastricht Treaty, which commenced in March 1996 and culminated in the agreement reached at the Amsterdam European Council in June last year.  The Irish Presidency in 1996 was able to play a central role in the drafting of the treaty.  I acknowledge the role played by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam is not a random step in the process of European integration.  It represents a limited but important further step in the development of the Union.  That process of development is based on the successive treaties agreed by the member states.  In 1957, for example, the Treaty of Rome set up the European Economic Community.  In 1985, the Single European Act gave fresh impetus to the completion of the internal market and the development of the policy of cohesion.  In 1991, the Maastricht Treaty <Col N="69" /> paved the way for economic and monetary union, the development of the common foreign and security policy and co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs.  It should be clearly understood that the Treaty of Amsterdam is part of that gradual process.  It consists entirely of a series of amendments to existing treaties on which the European Union and European Communities are based.</P>
    <P>During negotiation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the objective of bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to citizens was a primary concern of all member states.  That objective was addressed not only by developing significant new treaty provisions in areas such as employment and the fight against crime, but also by publicising and explaining the work of the intergovernmental conference and attempting to stimulate debate on the issues under consideration.</P>
    <P>In order to assist public understanding, the Government has published a detailed White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam which is comprehensive, factual and readable.  It sets out the background to the various issues and the changes which will result from the new treaty.  Copies of the White Paper and of the Treaty of Amsterdam are available in the Government Publications Sales Office.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has also produced a summary in Irish and English of the White Paper which is available from the Department, free of charge, on request.  I am confident that the White Paper and summary, as well as the establishment of an independent Referendum Commission, will facilitate a well informed public debate on the treaty.</P>
    <P>I now wish to examine in more detail the content of the new treaty.  The first of the five main headings for the work of the conference was &ldquo;The Union and the Citizen&rdquo;.  Existing treaties address the concerns of citizens in many practical ways. The new treaty is, however, the first which was negotiated with the priority aim of addressing as effectively as possible the most direct concerns of citizens.</P>
    <P>The promotion of a high level of employment will now be an explicit objective of the Union.  A new Title on employment will also be introduced into the EC Treaty which will provide a basis for more effective action at the level of the Union to address that objective.  It adds new procedures to the treaty designed to produce a co-ordinated Community strategy on employment.  It also provides for action by the Community in the form of incentive measures in the area of employment.  A new employment committee will provide greater coherence between economic and employment policies.  These new treaty provisions will ensure employment remains at the top of the Union's agenda and that the added value of co-ordinated action at the level of the Union is maximised.</P>
    <P>On social policy, the social agreement of Maastricht, which did not apply to the United Kingdom, is to be incorporated into the body of the EC Treaty.  This means that, in future, there <Col N="70" /> will be a single coherent legal basis for action by the 15 member states in the social area.  The Government welcomes the full incorporation of the social agreement into the treaty which had been a major goal for Ireland.  Any potential since Maastricht to create two different social regimes within the Community, with possibly detrimental implications for Ireland as well as other member states, will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The social provisions of the EC Treaty will also be strengthened.  In particular I wish to draw the attention of the House to the new treaty provisions on social exclusion.  The inclusion of these provisions, which reflects a proposal by the Irish delegation, will allow the Union undertake actions of particular value, such as incentive measures and pilot projects in relation to social exclusion.</P>
    <P>On the environment, the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises that environmental protection must be taken into account in all Community policies and activities.  The treaty, for the first time, explicitly incorporates the objective of promoting balanced and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>In public health, the Treaty of Amsterdam will strengthen existing EC Treaty provisions in a number of ways while continuing to recognise that fundamental responsibility in health and medical care matters must remain at national level.  The amendments will allow the Community to set safety standards in relation to human organs and blood and take measures specifically to protect human health against animal and plant diseases.  The treaty also provides for the Community to complement the actions of member states in reducing drugs related health damage, including through information and prevention.</P>
    <P>The internal market requires strengthened measures at European level to protect and inform consumers.  The Treaty of Amsterdam strengthens the possibility of promoting their interests. It provides that consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Community policies and activities.  Importantly, the Treaty of Amsterdam also provides for greater openness in the functioning of the Union' s institutions as well as for a right of access to documents.  The treaty also provides that any citizen may correspond with the Community institutions in any treaty language, including Irish.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, individually, these new provisions will provide a practical basis for bringing the Union closer to the citizens to whom it belongs and whose interests it is designed to serve.  I am also convinced that, cumulatively, the new treaty's emphasis on the concerns of citizens signifies an important long-term shift in the priorities of the Union.</P>
    <P>The relevance of the Treaty of Amsterdam to public concerns does not, of course, end here. The second main heading for the work of the conference was &ldquo;Freedom, Security and Justice&rdquo;. Under this heading also, the treaty includes provisions which will be of significant interest to citizens. <Col N="71" />  It will reaffirm the principles upon which the Union is founded, namely, liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  It will make respect for these principles a condition which must be met by a state applying to join the Union.  It will also provide for the possibility of sanctions in respect of a member state found to be in &ldquo;serious and persistent&rdquo; breach of those principles.</P>
    <P>The treaty, moreover, incorporates a provision which would allow the Council adopt measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  The provisions of the treaty are designed to ensure that respect for the principle of equality between men and women will be strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Union's power to combat crime, particularly crimes such as terrorism, trafficking in persons, offences against children and illicit trafficking in drugs and arms, will be significantly strengthened.  Primary responsibility for action in pursuit of criminals will remain, of course, with national police forces.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Freedom, Security and Justice&rdquo;, the treaty contains a complex set of provisions on what were known as justice and home affairs under the Maastricht Treaty.  The aim of these provisions is twofold: to strengthen the Union's capacity for action while at the same time strengthening its accountability for those actions by increasing the role of the European Court of Justice, the Commission and the European and national Parliaments.</P>
    <P>This goal is to be achieved in the following ways: by moving certain aspects of justice and home affairs concerning freedom of movement from the largely intergovernmental Third Pillar to the more supranational First Pillar; by bringing the intergovernmental co-operation by the 13 continental member states in the Schengen agreements into the EU legal framework; by taking account of the situations of the two island member states, namely, Ireland and the United Kingdom and by increasing the role of the European Court of Justice in the Third Pillar.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam inserts into the EC Treaty a new Title IIIa on free movement and related matters, such as visas, asylum and immigration.  This is covered by Article 2.15 of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Schengen process has developed since 1985 outside the structures of the European Union.  Schengen now involves 13 member states of the European Union as well as Norway and Iceland.  It deals with a range of issues such as borders, immigration controls and policing which overlap with the provisions of the new Title IIIa. It also deals with other matters related to freedom of movement which remain within the Third Pillar and which are dealt with in Article 1.11 of the treaty and the second protocol.</P>
    <P>For reasons related to the UK position on freedom of movement and the common travel area <Col N="72" /> between the two countries, neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom participate in Schengen. Now that those arrangements are to be brought within the EU framework by way of the second Protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom, if they wish, may continue to remain outside.  Either or both will, however, also be able to opt into all or part of Schengen subject to certain conditions. Corresponding provisions apply, in so far as Ireland and the United Kingdom are concerned to the provisions of new Title IIIa as long as the common travel area arrangements are maintained.</P>
    <P>A key aspect of the Treaty of Amsterdam is its introduction of democratic and judicial controls in the Third Pillar.  One important element in this context is jurisdiction for the court to give preliminary rulings on action taken under the Third Pillar where member states make a declaration accepting such jurisdiction.  The option of making such a declaration arises under Article 1.11 of the treaty.  I wish to relate this to our particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The complex array of provisions in this area reflects differences of geography and practice. On the one hand, the United Kingdom and Ireland share a long-standing common travel area and have no land border with their continental partners.  On the other hand, the 13 continental member states have been developing arrangements to ensure free movement between themselves.  These 13 states share a single land mass with each other and with the prospective new member states of the EU in central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland generally wishes to participate fully in any significant area of co-operation at the level of the European Union.  At the same time, we value the common travel area with the United Kingdom.  A large majority of journeys out of Ireland is to or through the United Kingdom.  Full free movement between Ireland and the 13 continental member states, if it undermined the common travel area, would in practice reduce free movement to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, Ireland has negotiated in the Treaty of Amsterdam what is, in a sense, an ideal arrangement.  Our right to preserve the common travel area with the United Kingdom is confirmed, but we and the United Kingdom may also request to participate in any actions at the level of the Union &mdash; either under the new Title or in the context of Schengen &mdash; where it suits us to do so.</P>
    <P>The third major area of work of the intergovernmental conference related to the external policy of the Union.  The European Union is a project for peace and security, founded on principles of democracy and human rights. The Common Foreign and Security Policy or CFSP provisions of the new treaty reflect the concern of citizens that the Union should make a greater contribution to international peace and security commensurate with its economic strength and its political responsibilities. <Col N="73" /> The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 established the CFSP at a time of profound and rapid change in international life as the Cold War came to an end, but conflicts in former Yugoslavia, in parts of the former Soviet Union and in areas of Africa have been evidence of a new instability in international affairs.  Accordingly, the EU members agreed that the CFSP should be made more effective, coherent and visible.  Decision-making procedures have been improved with a view to enabling the EU to act more quickly and effectively on the international stage.  A member state, however, currently cannot ultimately be outvoted where important national interests are involved. There will be improved planning and secretariat support for the Presidency of the day and the Council.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased by the outcome of the negotiations in the security and defence area.  In a positive response to the new crises and challenges of the post Cold War world, and in light of a joint proposal made by Sweden and Finland, which was supported by Ireland, the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping, humanitarian actions and crisis management have been included in the treaty.  These tasks will be carried out by the Western European Union, at the initiative of the European Union.  The EU member states which are not members of any military alliance, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Austria, will be entitled to participate in these missions, on a case by case basis, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks is in line with our long-standing and honourable record of contributing to UN peacekeeping operations, and responds to the new situation where the UN is increasingly mandating regional organisations to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management tasks.  The treaty provides for the progressive framing of a common defence policy which will be structured around the development of the EUWEU relationship, already established in the Maastricht Treaty, and with particular focus on the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unaffected by the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  As was the case in the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly states that the Union's policy shall not prejudice &ldquo;the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States&rdquo;.  This reference was inserted into the Maastricht Treaty to take account of Ireland's particular policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Like the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam evokes the concept of a future EU common defence only as a possibility and not as an agreed objective of the EU.  Neither an EU common defence nor the integration of the Western European Union into the EU are objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  They remain mere possibilities and are subject to a number of locks.</P>
    <P>First, they would require a consensus decision in the European Council, where Ireland has a veto.  Second, even if the European Council were <Col N="74" /> to take such a decision, this would be subject to adoption by each member state in accordance with its own national requirements.  Third, in the case of Ireland, the Government has given a commitment that a referendum would be held if the issue should arise for decision in the future.  I wish to reiterate that commitment.  Fourth, an EU common defence would require substantial treaty revisions and thus a further intergovernmental conference, in which each member state has a veto.  These substantial treaty revisions would have to be put to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Far from representing a threat to Ireland's policy of military neutrality, the European Union is responding to the various challenges of the post Cold War world and Ireland should play a full part in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>The fourth main area of work of the intergovernmental conference concerned the institutions of the European Union.  The negotiations on these aspects were important and sensitive.  On the one hand, it has become necessary in a Union of 15, which is facing into significant further enlargement, to adapt the existing institutions which were designed for a Community of six member states.  On the other hand, the existing institutional arrangements reflect principles and delicate balances which are the very foundation on which the Union is constructed.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam the functioning of the institutions will be more effective in a number of respects.  The use of qualified majority voting for normal Community business is to be extended.  The number of legislative procedures is to be reduced.  The complex co-decision procedure, which maximises the involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative process, is to be simplified and streamlined. The role within the European Commission of its President is to be enhanced.  The decision-making mechanisms and instruments in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the fight against crime are to be improved.</P>
    <P>The institutions will be also reshaped by the Treaty of Amsterdam to respond to concerns that they should be more open and democratic.  The co-decision procedure with the European Parliament is to be significantly extended and Parliament's role within that process is to be enhanced. A Protocol to the treaty on the role of national parliaments provides for an improved flow of information concerning Commission documents and proposals to national parliaments.  It foresees an enhanced role for COSAC, the Conference of European Affairs Committees of National Parliaments, both in making its own contribution to EU business and in examining certain legislative proposals and initiatives.</P>
    <P>A number of institutional issues also had implications for the balance between the more populous and less populous member states.  The outcome of the intergovernmental conference respects the interests of each member state and at the same time serves the interests of the Union as a whole.  Essentially, until the next enlargement <Col N="75" /> of the Union, there is to be no change in the size of the Commission or in the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers.  As from the entry of the first new member states to the Union, the larger member states will give up their second Commissioner.  This is on condition that by then a solution acceptable to all, which compensates the larger member states, has been found for the issue of the weighting of votes in the Council. One year before the membership of the European Union is to exceed 20, another Intergovernmental Conference is to be convened to undertake a comprehensive review of the institutions of the Union.</P>
    <P>The fifth area of the conference's work was the issue of so-called flexibility.  Articles 1.11 and 2.5 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will add general provisions to the European Union and European Community treaties which will allow a group of member states, less than the full membership, to use the Union's institutions to develop &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; between themselves under the First and Third Pillars.  These general flexibility provisions will not apply to the Second Pillar.</P>
    <P>I wish to recall briefly some of the significant things the treaty does not do.  It does not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  It does not affect the existing provisions on economic and monetary union which were agreed at Maastricht. It does not alter the balance between the institutions.  The Commission's role is fully preserved. It does not alter the balance between member states.  Each member state will maintain the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  In important and sensitive areas, such as employment and the fight against crime, the treaty provides for more effective action at the level of the Union but does not transfer to the Union the primary competence for such matters which remains at national level.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity is fully preserved and the detailed rules for its implementation will now be elaborated in the Treaty.  The ability to act at European level when necessary will thus continue to be combined with the right to act at national level when appropriate.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the House of the value to Ireland of our committed engagement in the process of European integration.  A quarter of a century ago the people took the decision that our future belonged in Europe.  Our current economic success and prospects are based largely on the benefits which flow to us from our membership of the EU.  Those benefits have become particularly apparent over the past few years.  There has been an unprecedented upswing in the Irish economy. The numbers at work have increased steadily. The level of our national prosperity is moving towards the European average.  While our own efforts, especially in the sound management of the economy and the success of our national partnership agreements, have contributed to the improvement, the EU has provided both the context and the necessary support for that progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Unrestricted access for our exports to a single market of 360 million people has given us the opportunity to expand and to diversify our exports.  Access to the Single Market has also been an important factor in encouraging foreign companies to invest in Ireland.  Currently there are some 1,100 foreign companies operating out of Ireland, employing directly over 100,000 people.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to overestimate the positive impact on farming and rural communities throughout Ireland of the opportunities and support provided by the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The Structural and Cohesion Funds have been of exceptional importance to our more recent economic development.  Between 1989 and 1999, it is estimated that contributions to Ireland from these funds will have averaged about 2.5 per cent of our GDP per annum.  They have financed substantial investment in infrastructure, sustained activity in agriculture and in rural areas, contributed significantly to tourism and industrial development, and helped to finance the major investment in human resources which is essential to sustained economic growth.  They constitute a permanent long-term investment in the economy which can sustain growth in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I should make particular mention of the EU Peace Programme as well as the Union's contribution to the International Fund for Ireland.  The practical impact which that assistance has on reconciliation and regeneration in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties is important.</P>
    <P>The legal framework for EMU was set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  Its provisions are not directly relevant to the debate on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  EMU remains, however, a very significant factor which should not be overlooked in any overall assessment of the benefits of our membership of the Union.  The Council meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in May will decide on the participants in the first phase of EMU.  Ireland looks forward to being among that group.</P>
    <P>The benefits of Union membership extend to many areas which are of vital importance in the daily life of our people &mdash; environmental protection, public health, the fight against drugs and organised crime, equality between men and women, education, and the rights of workers.  In these and other areas, membership of the EU has transformed the quality of life in this country.  Far from losing our identity in the Union, exposure to the languages and cultures of our continental neighbours has made us more confident of who we are and more aware of our own cultural values.  At every level, Europe has been an enriching experience for Irish people.</P>
    <P>One of the most important challenges facing the Union is its prospective further enlargement on a scale which is without precedent and which will require considerable resources.  The Union must provide itself with a level of resources <Col N="77" /> adequate both to face that challenge and to consolidate existing policies.  We welcome the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals which are designed to achieve both those ends.</P>
    <P>Ireland is set to continue to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy and from the Union's structural and cohesion policies.  Our economic development must be consolidated on a sustainable basis.  The Union's cohesion policy is a medium to long-term undertaking and we welcome the Commission's clear recognition of that fact.</P>
    <P>The third millennium brings with it a daunting array of challenges: globalisation of the world economy and its impact on employment, competitiveness and job creation; new security challenges; terrorism, drug trafficking and international crime; migratory pressures and ecological imbalances.  The Union must enlarge while preserving its nature and its strengths.  The Treaty of Amsterdam better equips the Union to deal with these challenges.  Its ratification by Ireland and the other member states is the next necessary step in preparing the Union for the future.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the leaders of the parties then in Government for negotiating the Treaty and for the manner in which they met the proposed constitutional amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Chancellor Kohl tells a story about an uncle, Walter Kohl, who died in World War I and a brother, Walter Kohl, who died in World War II.  He has a son called Walter Kohl and he is determined he will not die in a third world war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>He will survive a lot longer than the Deputy and I will survive in our jobs.</P>
      <P>If anybody asks what the Amsterdam Treaty is about, it is about Chancellor Kohl's son and about our children, about ensuring peace and stability into the third millennium and that we never revisit the way of &ldquo;politics&rdquo; and war in the first half of this century when 60 million Europeans killed each other in the service of the Kaiser, the king or whatever they considered in the national service.  That is what the Amsterdam Treaty is about and that is why Fine Gael will canvass vigorously in the Treaty campaign for a yes vote.</P>
      <P>We do not have the privilege of sitting down with a blank page and writing a constitution for a federal Europe.  All Europe is not yet in the European Union &mdash; there are 15 member states and 11 waiting to join.  In time it will be a Union of perhaps 30 member states.  We must gradually bring in new member states and gradually write a constitution for a federal or quasi-federal Europe as we proceed.  The Amsterdam Treaty is one of a series of important stages on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people criticised the Amsterdam Treaty <Col N="78" /> for not being sufficiently ambitious.  I am disappointed it does not deal with some of the institutional questions, but at least we have set out how we will deal with them and, significantly from our point of view, we have tied the structure and size of the Commission in the future to the question of weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers.  In Amsterdam some states wanted to deal with the weighting of votes issue and leave the Commission issue until later, but Ireland and other small states in particular were determined that would not happen, that we would deal with both issues in tandem.</P>
    <P>If the Amsterdam Treaty seems to lack ambition &mdash; there is a considerable number of important provisions in the Treaty &mdash; it is because Chancellor Kohl in particular and others were determined to see economic and monetary union become a reality.  To extend qualified majority voting across a wide range of areas was not on the agenda, to quote Chancellor Kohl, &ldquo;for now&rdquo;. That is the clearest indication that Germany in particular is determined that economic and monetary union will succeed.  It was not prepared to fight on two fronts and lose, it was determined to fight on one front, EMU, and win, and if that meant a less ambitious Amsterdam Treaty, that was a price worth paying.  That is a reasonable approach in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions in the Treaty have been overlooked.  If we consider them in detail we will agree there are many more ambitions provisions in the Treaty than have been referred to heretofore, particularly recommitting of the union to basic human rights and freedoms; allocating new powers to the EU to combat discrimination, including discrimination against persons with a disability, for which we campaigned vigorously; reinforcing co-operation between customs, judicial and police authorities of member states in the fight against crime and drugs, which is vitally important.  Crime is an international problem and the response must be in part international.  We are at last equipping the European Union to assist member states in co-ordinating the response to this problem.  Strengthening of the equality provisions of the Treaty, particularly for women, the disabled and minorities, is provided for, and protection of the environment is stated as a core objective of the European Union. Establishing consumer protection as a priority of the European Union is included, as is committing the Union to a high level of human health.  Those are all very important.</P>
    <P>There is also the important provision of ensuring that the fight against drugs is a specific objective of the EU, as is the strengthening of workers' rights by recognising the charter on fundamental workers' rights, the incorporation of the social charter, not as a protocol but as part of the treaty proper, and giving the EU new powers to tackle poverty.  With regard to the latter, I hope the experience of local development in Ireland, which is a partnership between the EU and the State, is something other EU member states will copy.  I <Col N="79" /> also hope the Union and the State will have a renewed commitment to it after 1999.</P>
    <P>The unique approach of partnership, not just between the EU and the State but between the social partners, State agencies and local communities in a participative democracy tackling the causes of long-term disadvantage means that in rural and urban areas we are at last trying to ensure that much of the benefits which have accrued since we joined the EU will reach those in the most needy parts of the community.  I have a mixed constituency ranging from areas of great need in the inner city to areas of lesser need to relatively well off pockets.  During the last general election campaign I met a constituent from one of these pockets who upbraided me because she did not see much of the benefits of the Celtic tiger and people at work were making similar complaints.  I asked her to look down the road where she would see one or two cars in each driveway, telephone lines and central heating, carpets and colour televisions in the houses where most of the children were educated to second and third level. She dismissed that and pointed out that people in the golf club did not consider they were benefiting.  It is true that some are not benefiting to the same extent as others.  However, I told her that in her mother's time there were no colour televisions, carpets, telephone lines, cars in the driveways nor the same kind of educational provision and people did not attend golf clubs to complain.</P>
    <P>Those of us doing well need to be told that it does not get much better.  We should admit we are doing well and seek to share the provisions of our newfound wealth with those who are less well off.  When we joined the EU our per capita income was approximately 56 per cent of the average of the then poorer community of nine countries.  Today in a wealthier union of 15 member states our <i>per capita</i> income on a GNP basis is 103 per cent of the average and 90 per cent of the average on a GDP basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have some way to go to close the gap with the wealthier parts of the Union, but great progress has been made.  I remember when the best road in the country stretched from Newlands Cross to Naas.  When I became a Member of this House one of the issues on which I campaigned was the waiting list for telephones.  Today we have a much better road network and our telephone and communications infrastructure enables us to have a financial services centre in Dublin.  Much of this is down to our EU membership and the vision of those who, in the 1960s and 1970s, campaigned for us to join the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have held the presidency of the EU on five occasions since joining in 1973.  Those who argue that membership has weakened our sovereignty or our role in the world are not telling the truth. It is time they were confronted.  Who wanted the <Col N="80" /> ear of Ireland before we joined the EU?  Evidence of our role in the world can be taken from the number of embassies that have opened.  They want our ear because we have an economic and political role in the world.  In this, and in terms of our wellbeing, we have been well served by the EU.</P>
    <P>If we want that to continue and if we want to ensure our prosperity we must have peace and stability, not only in Ireland and the EU but on the continent of Europe.  If we do not want our children or Chancellor Kohl's children to go the way of 60 million Europeans in the first half of this century, most of them young men, we must ensure the continued integration of Europe and enlargement of the EU.  We need enlargement not simply for selfless or altruistic reasons because we wish to help our neighbours who have suffered almost half a century of communist rule, but also for selfish reasons to ensure the prerequisites of prosperity &mdash; peace and stability on the continent of Europe.  We must build this continent together.  We speak of an agreed Ireland, North and South.  We also need an agreed Europe, east, west, north and south. The Amsterdam Treaty is an important step in that process.</P>
    <P>The employment provisions of the treaty have not received much publicity.  The measures provided for include member states being committed to developing a co-ordinated strategy for employment, with specific regard to producing a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce.  This work between member states will be backed up with support from community institutions.  The EU Council of Ministers and the Commission will produce an annual report on employment in the EU.  Member states who do not measure up to that report will be embarrassed, questioned and pressured to ensure that employment becomes a priority in their country and, therefore, across the Union.  Guidelines based on this report will be issued which member states should take into account when drafting employment policies.  The EU Council of Ministers will also be allowed to use incentive measures to encourage co-ordination in this area.</P>
    <P>The action of member states in the field of employment will be improved through exchanges of information and best practice.  Work done in different member states will be compared which, it is hoped, will promote innovative approaches to promoting employment.  An advisory employment committee will be established, comprising two representatives from each member state and two representatives from the EU Commission. They will have the task of monitoring all aspects of employment policy and making recommendations as to how member states might improve employment.</P>
    <P>This is a significant step forward.  I was a member of the reflection group which set out in June 1995 to prepare an annotated agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.  We set ourselves the objective of being relevant to the citizen, <Col N="81" /> transparent and of making the Union more effective and efficient.  These employment provisions make the Union relevant &mdash; this is one of the most pressing issues as far as citizens are concerned &mdash; as does the fight against crime, environmental issues, improvements for the consumer and the health provisions.  They relate directly to the improved running of the Union to the betterment of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In terms of democracy we set out to ensure that the balance between the institutions of the Union and the member states was not upset.  Within those parameters, the main institution to benefit from the Amsterdam Treaty will be the European Parliament.  This is correct because we want a higher degree of transparency.</P>
    <P>I regret that doubt was cast on the wording of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  This matter could have been handled better but I will draw a veil over it.  There is no point going over old ground.  However, it is obvious the claims that Article 29.4.6 left options open on a future common defence policy are nonsense.  The new wording of the subsection clearly relates to everything except defence.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's view that neutrality is not affected by the Amsterdam Treaty. I accept it is not compromised by it, but my reading of Article J.7 leads me to believe that, if the Amsterdam Treaty is passed, neutrality will be written into the Constitution for the first time in terms of our membership of the European Union. Ireland could join NATO tomorrow.  I am not aware of any constitutional ban on such a move. The Houses of the Oireachtas could decide to join if they wished.  However, if the Amsterdam Treaty, including the new Article J.7, is passed, and there is a European Union common defence policy in the future or a merger of the EU and the Western European Union, three steps would be required.</P>
    <P>First, an intergovernmental conference must be held.  This is provided for in Article J.7. Second, a decision must be made by the European Council.  This decision must be unanimous on the part of all 15 member states because such decisions are based on unanimity.  Third, under Article J. 7 if such a move was proposed it would require ratification in each member state in accordance with the constitutional position in each state. After the court ruling in Ireland on the Single European Act, this means a referendum irrespective of whether the Government gives an undertaking.</P>
    <P>Some people said the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty were further erosions of Ireland's neutrality.  They say the same about the Amsterdam Treaty but they should stop their Paisleyite approach to the debate on European integration.  They should wear glasses for long enough to read the provisions and admit that far from compromising Ireland's neutrality, the treaty will ensure the three steps I mentioned must be taken.  This includes a constitutional <Col N="82" /> amendment in the future if the Amsterdam Treaty is passed.</P>
    <P>We should make it clear to the public that Ireland may be invited in the future to join a common defence arrangement or agree to a merger of the EU and Western European Union.  This may happen when the number of member states increases to 30.  It is not on the agenda now and there is no pressure for such a move.  It is not only resisted by neutral countries; many of the other member states, including some of the larger countries, do not want such a development.  They view NATO as their defence umbrella and they do not want to know about a merger between the EU and Western European Union.  Nobody is leading Ireland into such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>However, if such a proposal is put forward in the future, our children and grandchildren should be allowed to decide the issue for themselves in terms of the integrated Europe in which they will live in the 21st century.  We should not pretend they will never be asked to make such a decision. However, if the Amsterdam Treaty, including Article J.7, is passed, it will be their decision if such a proposal is made because a constitutional amendment must be introduced.</P>
    <P>The way the Schengen agreement has developed is regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it has been incorporated in the treaty.  However, I regret that 13 member states will be part of the Schengen area but Britain and Ireland will be outside it.  The simple reason Ireland is not a participant is that 70 per cent of journeys outside the State are to the United Kingdom and because it would not join, it was impossible for Ireland to be part of a common travel area with Britain and also in the Schengen area with the other 13 member states. This will be of concern to citizens and it will be difficult to explain that Norwegians and Icelanders will have greater rights and freedom of travel without passports within the European Union than British and Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  It has an enlightened approach to the matter and it told me that the British trade union congress also has such an approach.  I hope the British congress of trade unions has some influence on the British Government.  If there is to be freedom and security, our external borders should be secured but people should have the right to freedom of movement within the borders.  A two tier Europe should not be created where British and Irish citizens have a different arrangement for travelling within the European Union from the other 13 member states.  It will be a weaker arrangement than that for Norway and Iceland which are outside the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not refer to the date for the referendum.  It is time we knew when it is <Col N="83" /> likely to be held.  I welcome the other developments in the common foreign and security policy areas, such as the transfer of the Petersberg tasks, which include humanitarian aid, search and rescue, peace-keeping and peacemaking, from the Western European Union to the EU.  I also welcome the creation of the planning and analysis unit which should act as an early warning system and a research facility for member states, the Council of Ministers, the Commission and others. I welcome the appointment of the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers as the high representative for foreign policy.</P>
    <P>However, the European Union will remain ineffective as long as decisions are taken unanimously on the gamut of common foreign and security policy areas, for example, the position in the former Yugoslavia, Algeria or Kosovo, issues which have heated up in recent days.  It will not have an effective influence in the Middle East or even Algeria.  We must think in terms of having not only a decent planning and analysis unit, but also greater co-ordination of the approach to common foreign and security concerns.  For example, Europe is the single biggest economic contributor to the Middle East, but it does not punch its weight politically.  This is left to the United States.</P>
    <P>I support the Amsterdam Treaty and the process of European integration.  It is a welcome development and Ireland and western Europe should not stop reminding themselves of the benefits they have derived from membership of the European Union.  We must set about sharing those benefits with our neighbours and planning the future evolution of an integrated Europe to ensure that it continues to play its role in an increasingly regionalised world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the clarity of his speech.  I join him in praising the excellence of the White Paper, particularly chapter 2 which summarises the structure of the treaties.  Those responsible should be aware of the compliments of the House.</P>
      <P>I also compliment my former Ministerial colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on his work as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.  The present Minister has already referred to his work with task forces, and the benefits of his immersion in that work were amply demonstrated here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of serried ranks of journalists is an indication of how the nation has been galvanised into hysteria about the forthcoming referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  There is a problem shared by the three parties which negotiated this treaty and the two parties now in Government.  The level of unanimity on the broad structure of the European project is seen as a cosy consensus, and there is thus no immediate story to be reported on.  It also enables many people, castigated properly in their absence by Deputy Mitchell, to avail of a sense of fairness in <Col N="84" /> our media and a statutory requirement for balance in our national broadcasting company.  They have been given a platform to articulate contradictory assertions or plain nonsense.  We had a very good exposition of this in relation to military neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address the interaction between the forthcoming referendum and a referendum on the hoped for settlement in Northern Ireland.  The House was told earlier there may be a referendum some time in May on the outcome of the Northern Ireland talks.  It is obvious this referendum cannot be held before 1 May.  If it is intended to hold the treaty referendum before 1 May, it would be unwise to do so prior to the final decision of the countries which will form the single currency group to participate in EMU.  The debate on the Amsterdam Treaty between now and 1 May will be dominated by one issue, the single currency, which has nothing to do with the text before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the history of the European project, beginning with the story of Helmut Kohl and his son Walter.  That story could be told by many people in continental Europe, but it could also be told in Ireland.  It is a mistake to think we escaped the First World War and what is termed the &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo;.  We escaped conscription in the First World War, but many Irishmen from North and South fought in that war.  Many Irishmen volunteered to fight in the Second World War &mdash; 99.99 per cent on the Allied side &mdash; and many of them died.  The proof of this is on memorial tablets in Church of Ireland graveyards; two generations of part of our community met their deaths in continental battles. The suggestion that Ireland was somehow insulated from the military conflict of the Second World War does not accord with history.  There were also incidents such as the bombing of Belfast and the North Strand.</P>
    <P>The loss of life in the Second World War led to a series of stepping stones towards what the Treaty of Rome described as the ever closer union of European people.  The ambiguity of that phrase was deliberately chosen to ensure that while the objective was constantly in front of people, the precise description was never put in place so that it could not become a source of dispute.  However, we have been inexorably moving towards that ever closer union.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the latest measure as another step in that movement.  The Coal and Steel Treaty was negotiated in the early 1950s and the Treaty of Rome brought together six States in 1956.  The first enlargement brought in three more States in 1973.  Greece came in on its own in 1980 and two more States were admitted in 1985.  Those States were admitted to consolidate their democracies.  The collapse of Communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall was not the first occasion on which the EU was enlarged to embrace countries which had previously been denied democratic institutions.  The Portuguese had been denied democracy from the early 1920s <Col N="85" /> until 1974.  The Greeks had been denied democracy on various occasions, most recently from 1967 to 1974.  Spain had been denied democracy from the end of the Spanish Civil War until the death of Franco in the 1970s.  Enlargement to the south of Europe was to consolidate fragile democracies in what had been previously western dictatorships.</P>
    <P>The most recent enlargement brought in three neutral countries: Finland, Austria and Sweden. Norway almost entered.  The addition of those neutrals has changed the balance of some aspects of foreign policy and the composition of the complex and diverse culture of the EU.  The enlargement process has not been the only set of stepping stones.  There were also measures like the Single European Act of 1987 and the Maastricht Treaty, which laid the groundwork for the single currency.  This comes into effect on 1 January 1999 and the political decisions to give effect to that will be made within nine weeks of today.</P>
    <P>The European project cannot be understood unless one looks at the entire series of steps taken to date and the steps that will have to be taken before reaching the end.  Deputy Mitchell referred to that end as coming in 25 to 30 years, when there will be 25 and 30 member States in the EU.  The Amsterdam Treaty plays a positive role in this regard.  We have moved from a common market to a social community.  Additional competencies are included in the Amsterdam Treaty such as employment, health and safety, discrimination, co-operation against crime and drug trafficking, equality, the environment, consumer protection and others are a clear extension of the dimensions of this project far beyond the commercial confines of a mere common market or its now vanished alternative, a European free trade area.  It is the confusion between the common market and the community that is at the core of many misconceptions and misunderstandings that have bedevilled the debate on this matter in Britain.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to put in place a comprehensive policy initiative to address the growing problem of homelessness and to provide a co-ordinated and comprehensive interdepartmental response to this growing crisis as it affects adults and children, with its related problems of crime and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>With the agreement of the House, I wish to share time with Deputies Allen and Perry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address this important national issue. We are facing a crisis in regard to homelessness which requires an urgent response from the Government.  It is regrettable the Government's actions in this area have been lacklustre, to say the least.  The Fine Gael Party firmly believes that we must provide adequate resources for this area of public policy when our economy is booming.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is on the increase.  The agencies who deal with the issue readily admit that, despite the profoundly favourable economic climate we are enjoying, the problem of homelessness has grown to an unprecedented level in recent years. It is contradictory that at a time of exceptional wealth and the most favourable revenue position ever, a persistent group of women and men and, increasingly, children, find their only form of shelter is on a street corner or in a hostel.  The issue of homelessness in the context of our Celtic tiger economy should be a source of genuine embarrassment for every member of this society.  The increasing number of people without a home is by far the most concrete example that our society has become indifferent to the plight of the poor. As long as we fail to respond to the needs of the homeless in a concerted and planned way, we cannot and should not boast to the world about our economic performance.</P>
      <P>The sole intention of the motion is to highlight the Government's disgraceful performance to date in responding to the homelessness crisis.  The motion is a political one and we make no apology for that.  Governments make political choices about disbursing taxpayers' money.  The December budget highlighted the extent of the Government's choices.  A Government which makes a political choice to reward investors and speculators, through an immoral reduction in capital gains tax, is not one that can seriously argue it is either concerned or troubled about the problem of homelessness.  A Government which had £520 million to disburse on budget day showed clearly, in its choice of redistribution, that those at the very margins of our society are relegated to the bottom of its priorities.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the choices that were made in the recent budget, the Taoiseach's decision to select a Progressive Democrat to head up policy on housing for low income people made a mockery of the Government's stated objective to develop &ldquo;a national strategy to deal with homelessness&rdquo;. The matter before the House is a political one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 November last, I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy to outline the precise work to date on the development of a national strategy to deal with the issue of homelessness.  I discovered an appalling lack of competence from the Government and the Minister of State in charge. Despite the specific commitment in the Government's programme to draw up a national strategy, <Col N="87" /> precious little work has taken place to date.  The Minister of State has spent more time poking his nose into the affairs of individual local authority housing programmes without much success.  The Government is intent on sitting back while the homelessness problem, in the words of the Simon Community, has never been more acute.</P>
    <P>In response to a Dáil question I tabled in November, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, admitted that he is not a member of a key Government committee established to deal with social exclusion.  How can a Minister of State, whose function is to co-ordinate the Government's response to the issue of homelessness, not be a member of a committee that would ultimately address matters to do with homelessness?  If the issue of homelessness is not on the agenda of a committee to deal with social exclusion, what is?  Will the Minister of State confirm that the Taoiseach did not invite him to join the committee dealing with social exclusion?  The calamity that is the handling of this issue by the Government, and particularly the Minister of State, should be exposed for what it represents, a complete lack of urgency about the increasing problem of homelessness in our society.</P>
    <P>It is high time we obtained a realistic and accurate assessment of the nature of this problem.  It is a matter of considerable unease that the only national information on homelessness relates to the national housing survey of 1996.  Some two years later we still rely on the work of groups such as Simon and Focus Ireland to provide more realistic figures and up to date information about the problem.  The difficulty of the latest assessment was highlighted recently by Fine Gael, when our research showed then in excess of 37,000 applicants were currently on local authority housing lists.  This figure showed a 30 per cent increase on the official figures released in 1996.  Particular problems surrounding the official version of homelessness have not been addressed.  The census is taken on one particular night and does not reflect the level of hidden homelessness.</P>
    <P>Focus Ireland believes the true level of homelessness is somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 persons.  This contrasts sharply with the official figure of 2,501 from the 1996 housing assessment. The Dublin Simon Community soup run recently met 151 homeless people on one night.  This compares with a comment made by a senior official in Dublin Corporation who said it recently established that between eight and 15 people were homeless on the streets of Dublin each night.  We cannot begin to develop a strategy to deal with this issue when there are such widely differing and incorrect assumptions.</P>
    <P>The most worrying feature about Simon's latest information is the dramatic rise in the number of young people on the streets.  Nearly half, 46 per cent, of the overall figure were people under 25 years of age and 10 per cent were children under 16 years of age.  I do not have to remind the House of the huge dangers that confront children <Col N="88" /> on the streets of our cities.  Information contained in the survey indicates that 75 per cent of people have been sleeping rough for more than one year. This highlights the gross inadequacy of the response of health boards, local authorities and the Government to the scale of the problem.  We are beginning to see an entire generation of people who, because they cannot find regular accommodation, are left to fend for themselves on our streets.  Despite the resources which have been put into this area, it is fair to say that all our efforts to date have not made any difference to the number of homeless people.</P>
    <P>The present shortage of affordable accommodation, particularly in urban areas, has a dramatic effect on the scale of the problem.  We are all aware of the hype which has surrounded the issue of house prices.  While it is correct that we address head on the issue of house prices we must not forget the real victims of the spiralling house market are those who can least afford to purchase a home or rent accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael survey of local authority housing lists highlighted that those on the margins of society have suffered most from the spiralling house prices and that investors and speculators have a bigger stake in that market than ordinary PAYE taxpayers.  We must attempt to resolve the difficulties in the housing market but we must not forget that for over 5,000 people the dream of purchasing a home is unattainable.</P>
    <P>The housing need has never been addressed in a coherent way.  This point was highlighted in the l995 ESRI report, an analysis of social housing need.  Has the Department of the Environment and Local Government carried out any research in the area of housing need?  It is unfortunate that we do not have in place a concrete strategy between the public and private housing markets to meet housing need.  While there are thousands of people on local authority housing lists, all these people are not regarded as homeless, yet many do not have secure, suitable, affordable or adequate accommodation.  It would be entirely wrong to presume the housing and shelter needs of 5,000 people on our streets represent the only aspect of this problem.  Any assessment of housing need must take into account the chronic overcrowding, tension and stress that is building up in many estates, particularly in Dublin, but also in other urban areas.  Has the Government any appreciation of the housing crisis?</P>
    <P>Every person who ends up on the street has a story to tell.  These people come from different and difficult backgrounds.  It has been mentioned recently that the homeless are the end product of the State's failure to provide preventive child care services, particularly for young people who are unable to cope at home or for whom life is a misery in an uncaring or abusive household.  They include men who have become separated from their families and a large section comprises people who have addiction problems, particularly in relation to drugs or alcohol.  For many the <Col N="89" /> street is the only form of accommodation after being barred from a city hostel or shelter.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the State's responsibility in relation to this matter.  It is essential that a radical plan to reduce local authority housing lists be put in place.  The time is long since past when above average increases in the number of homes are provided annually.  A massive plan for local authority house building is required when we as a society have the resources to make such a difference.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide accommodation for people where rents can be organised through housing co-operatives or voluntary agencies. There is a need also to provide a comprehensive counselling service for homeless people.  Those on our streets require one-to-one counselling.  Above all what is required is a sustained level of investment in the amount of resources provided to local authorities, health boards and other agencies. This point was made forcefully by Fr. Peter McVerry, when speaking about the frustration felt in relation to the Eastern Health Board, who said: &ldquo;If they would just come out and tell the truth, which is that they do not have enough money from the Government to deal with this problem, I could respect that at least&rdquo;.  The emergency accommodation and the city hostels are bulging at the seams.  The problem of homelessness will continue to grow unless the Government decides once and for all to fund all the related agencies who must respond to this crisis. The number of homeless here represents the shameful truth behind our economy.  No society can call itself civilised if it accepts that a persistent section of its population has no shelter or accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a major social contradiction here when at a time of economic boom we have a growing problem of homelessness.  At a time when the Celtic tiger is roaring many of our sons and daughters are neglected and forgotten.  Local authority figures nationwide &mdash; I would be more familiar with the figures for the Cork area &mdash; indicate that nearly 3,000 people are on the housing list and hundreds are in substandard accommodation.  Given the boasts of the Government it is a shame the Celtic tiger has passed these people by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Homelessness is a growing problem among young people.  Homelessness, crime and drug taking are intertwined.  Heroin abuse is by far the most pressing aspect of the drugs problem.  Primarily it is a Dublin problem confined mainly to areas of economic and social disadvantage, but the use of soft drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy is a countrywide problem.  These drugs are available in every town and village, despite some recent successes by the Garda who seized approximately £1 million worth of ecstasy tablets in my county.  Heroin abuse is the biggest challenge facing the Government, the statutory authorities and communities.  If we are to deal successfully with this challenge there is a need for <Col N="90" /> effective co-operation and co-ordination between the statutory and other agencies in developing and implementing an anti-drugs programme.</P>
    <P>Local communities need to be involved in the drafting and implementation of measures.  The rainbow Government set aside additional funding of £14 million to implement steps to deal with the major problem.  A sum of £10 million was set aside for the implementation of anti-drug strategies to be implemented by local drug task forces in the worst affected areas.  Some £1 million was provided to health boards to develop anti-drug strategies and £3 million for estate improvement programmes, a fund which would help local authorities to tackle environmental and other issues in badly run down housing estates and flats complexes in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The local drug task forces set up in 12 areas of Dublin and one in the north side of Cork City were intended to provide a locally based response by the statutory, voluntary and community sectors to the drugs problem.  Other steps decided as a result of the Government initiative were the development of information and research projects, treatment units for young drug misusers, funding to deal with waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board area, mobile clinics, telephone help lines and the rehabilitation of young drug addicts. That rehabilitation programme was planned to be carried out in conjunction with FÁS.  A comprehensive prevention programme was to be set up in all schools.  It was intended to include an effective youthreach programme which would identify young people at risk and encourage them into activities attractive to them.  More importantly these activities would be accredited in the hope of getting young people back into mainstream education.  Steps were taken to put in place a comprehensive policing strategy in the areas worst affected by the drugs scourge</P>
    <P>The rainbow Government placed the drug problem at the top of its agenda but in contrast the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government is complacent in dealing with this problem. This complacency was reflected in the decision to scrap the £20 million youth development fund, a decision it reversed rapidly by setting up a youth development programme because of extreme anger from the communities affected and Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The training and employment of youth leaders must be a priority issue and an abuse prevention programme must be accelerated in the youth work sector by an immediate dramatic increase in the number of outreach programmes in areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>The role of sport and recreation as the most effective preventative elements in the fight against crime and drugs was recognised in the national plan for sport published in February l997.  The delay in placing the Sports Council on a statutory basis has affected the establishment of local sports development fora to co-ordinate local activities and bring clubs and groups together to <Col N="91" /> fight the problems of crime and drugs among young people.</P>
    <P>Investment in sports and recreational facilities offering young people positive alternatives must be a priority for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  His decision to freeze applications from clubs and community groups has sent the wrong signal.  These clubs and groups which are struggling day in, day out to cater for the thousands of young people at risk are concerned that there will be overemphasis on the provision of large scale national facilities involving high costs and that the provision of community facilities which are vitally important to keep young people on the straight and narrow will be neglected.</P>
    <P>The provision of facilities alone will not ensure the participation of young people in activities.  It was planned to give the development of sports and leisure facilities a major impetus by appointing sports and leisure officers, especially in areas of deprivation and greatest need where young people are demoralised, demotivated and reluctant to get involved in team activities.  These officers would ensure the maximum utilisation of facilities by acting as facilitators for schools, youth organisations and sports clubs and directing groups involved in youth activities towards the available facilities.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed at first hand the downward spiral in the behaviour of many young people.  It starts with disillusionment at school followed by absence from it, involvement in petty crime, dabbling in drugs, ejection from home and, ultimately, homelessness and, often, imprisonment. There is an urgent need to break the cycle through the use of the demographic dividend in education and by allowing more schools to benefit under the initiative introduced by the previous Government.  Radical intervention at the earliest stage can prevent further trouble.  There should be more outreach programmes operated by the excellent national youth organisations.  There should be a greater bias towards the development of sports and recreational facilities in deprived communities.  There are sufficient resources available to develop facilities at national, regional and local level.  Investment at local level acts as a catalyst.  I have witnessed the positive effect this has had throughout the country as community groups seek to wean young people away from a life of crime and drugs towards positive activities.</P>
    <P>The relevant Ministers should make quick and early decisions on the allocation of the youth development fund moneys.  One of the most novel and imaginative projects ever submitted to Government was sanctioned by the previous Government.  It involves the development by local soccer and GAA clubs in conjunction with Cork County Board of 100 acres of land on the north western side of Cork city which is being used by drug takers, drug pushers, the homeless and the young people on whom society has turned its back.  This project would give them new hope.  Unfortunately, between June and Christmas, the moneys earmarked for the project by the previous Government were spent elsewhere. <Col N="92" />  An early decision is essential to allow it to proceed.  The four clubs involved are committed to providing £850,000 of the £2.3 million required. The area in question has been described as an unemployment blackspot.  I hope the youth development fund moneys will be spent quickly and effectively to get young people at risk off the streets and involved in positive activities.</P>

      <P>The Celtic tiger is well named.  It is sometimes forgotten that the tiger is a vicious animal which hunts, attacks, maims and wounds the weak.  While many people have made a lot of money in the surging economy, many others have been damaged.  The number of people who are homeless is frightening.  The problem which has reached crisis proportions is not confined to Dublin.  It affects men and women, young and old, married and single.  Young people, some not even in their teens, walk and sleep on the streets of our cities and towns affected by the ravages of social exclusion.  We have to give them hope and honour the commitment that the rising tide will lift all boats.  This debate is timely in that it gives us an opportunity to demonstrate clearly that we are concerned about the less well off.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is reversible.  The first requirement is to place it at the top of the agenda.  We must identify the needs of the homeless and develop a strategy as a matter of urgency.  We must give voluntary groups the resources they require.  There has been much talk about the concept of zero tolerance of crime and traffic congestion in Dublin.  The same concept should be applied to homelessness.  Let us show that this House cares and will take action.  This debate will create an interest and awareness.  Various charities have worked tirelessly in caring for the less well off.  I compliment in particular the Simon Community in Dublin which has done unbelievable work in providing accommodation for the homeless.</P>
      <P>Services for the homeless should be reviewed. The strategy is based on incorrect assumptions by the health board.  One has only to walk the streets of Dublin to get a clear indication that the problem is more serious than people realise.  Services must be improved and extended if the crisis in the city is to be tackled effectively.  All the shelters are full by 9 p.m. Those who have a drink or a drugs problem are not allowed in.  These people have to be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In corporation housing estates there is a high level of dissatisfaction.  This is a major source of concern.  People have come to me to have essential repairs to doors and windows carried out.  At a time when our economy is booming the outlook is bleak for those who are socially excluded and who are paying perhaps £3 or £4 a week for accommodation.  Something must be done for them.  The report indicates less accommodation is available to a homeless person who wants to resettle than was available 12 months ago.  It states that virtually no local authority housing has been offered to the homeless for whom the voluntary services provide.  Essentially what is needed is for local authorities and charities to work <Col N="93" /> together to provide accommodation and education for the homeless.</P>
    <P>Those who work in shelters do fantastic work, but we must develop that shelter network.  Those who are being looked after in shelters should not be in them in a year's time.  They should be educated and be moved to other accommodation which would give them some dignity and self-respect.  There has been a surge in the economy, our balance of payments is good and while the Lord helps those who help themselves, those who are at the lowest level need as much help as possible.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure his Department works with other Departments to collectively set up a national forum to deal exclusively with resolving the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>It is a major problem in Dublin, but it is also a problem in Sligo and other cities.  Charities, AA and groups fighting drug abuse, which have been given substantial State funding, do their best, but we must adopt a zero tolerance approach to those living on our streets.  While walking towards my accommodation recently I saw a person sleeping in a cardboard box with a hat on the pavement for donations.  London is called the cardboard city, but Dublin will soon become one.  Given that we are the leading economy in Europe and the Minister for Finance said we are eligible to join EMU, we must work tirelessly to address this problem.</P>
    <P>This survey should be published and its findings should be closely studied.  There is a good deal of disparity between the number of homeless indicated by health boards and the actual number living on the streets.  An independent observation group should undertake a study.  I respect the figures given by the Simon Community.  They indicate this is a major problem involving children as young as ten or 12 and I appreciate there are many family difficulties.  It is extremely difficult to provide accommodation for the homeless, but the Departments concerned must co-operate and establish a fund to address this problem.  The number who are homeless is increasing daily.  The problem is not confined to the winter months.  In winter, shelters are full by 9 o'clock and the numbers in them fall in the summer because many who are homeless sleep on benches in parks.</P>
    <P>The Government initiative for the homeless, a Government sponsored taskforce of voluntary and statutory groups who provide a service for those who are homeless, has been advised of the results of this survey.  It is important that task force studies the survey closely and prepares a proposal to implement its recommendations.  I am sure a good deal of time and money went into preparing this survey.  A good deal of effort can be spent publishing reports, many of which are put on shelves without their recommendations being implemented.  Reports are fine and well but action is needed.  We would all agree that the action needed is an approach that will ensure fewer people are homeless.  At a time when our economy is the envy of Europe, we have a responsibility to look after our own.  Charity begins at home.  Something is drastically wrong when Irish citizens have to sleep on pavements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I appeal to the Minister of State to address this problem.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting findings of the survey is that 10 per cent of under 16 year olds are regularly presenting as homeless on the streets.  The EHB has responsibility for attending to their accommodation and care needs.  An effective strategy to deliver on that responsibility needs to be urgently devised.  Of those surveyed 46 per cent are under 25.  They constitute a vulnerable group and their accommodation needs must be urgently addressed.  More than 75 per cent of those surveyed have been homeless for more than a year.  It might be tolerable for a person to be homeless for a number of weeks, but it is discouraging for a person to be homeless for more than a year and it does not say much for our commitment to address this issue.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that a successful intervention towards resettlement needs to be made in the initial period after a person becomes homeless and, for a variety of reasons, settlement options are becoming more limited.  It is important that as soon as a person is identified as homeless he or she is given the necessary counselling and education.  That is particularly important in the case of young people.  It is extremely dangerous for young people to be homeless and it may cause them to commit all sorts of crime.  I suspect a number of homeless people would look on Mountjoy as an alternative form of accommodation.  Many young people may invite crime to get a safe bed in prison.</P>
    <P>This survey was carried out in the winter with a view to forming a &ldquo;cold weather&rdquo; strategy to deal with this problem.  The experience of the Simon Community indicates the number of people on the streets falls in the winter.  Given that all hostels and shelters are virtually full at 9 p.m. or earlier during that time, a survey of those who are homeless needs to be undertaken on a yearly basis.  People are waiting for hostels to open to get their supper and be given accommodation.  This is a major crisis.  The number of people who sleep on the footpaths of this capital each night is 151 which is comparable to number of Deputies in Leinster House.  We must take action to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>This is not only a problem in Dublin but in many cities on the western seaboard.  There has been an upsurge in the population of Galway and other cities.  Homelessness is a major city problem.  The best way to tackle it is to invite the statutory groups and the partnership groups to co-operate to deal with it.  Deputy Allen said a community initiative is required to deal with it. That is where the real response to this problem can be found.  We need to fund people to enable them to help themselves.  The homeless will accept the opinion of one of their own.  We should invite them to help themselves.  Economic community initiatives can be effective in having collectively gathered funds spent locally.  It is also important to invite the homeless to participate and to treat them with the dignity and respect to which all people are entitled.</P>
    <P>The introduction of initiatives in towns and cities will help address this problem.  While this is <Col N="95" /> mainly a city problem, it will become a problem in towns in the not too distant future.  There has been a growth in the population of our cities and large towns, but the roaring Celtic tiger hurts many people.  For them it is only a myth from which they can never aspire to benefit.  There is an obligation on us, as elected representatives, to ensure we provide the necessary funds to help these people.  Those on the streets, the funding agencies and the Government must work in partnership to ensure the plight of the homeless is made a good deal easier than it is at present.  I am delighted to speak on this issue and I appeal to the Minister to do what he can, to urge the publication of this report and ensure it is read by as many people as possible to get the message across that there is a major problem.</P>

      <P>The motion raises the question of homelessness as it affects both adults and children. Homelessness is always distressing.  A person, whether an adult or child, who becomes homeless experiences deprivation and social exclusion in their most extreme forms.  The response to homelessness must be targeted and effective.  The situation of homeless adults is met with a range of co-ordinated accommodation and related services which I will outline later.  The situation of homeless children requires a more specific response.  This is explicitly recognised in the separate legislative provision and ministerial responsibility for child care. In this debate, I will address the issue of homeless adults which comes under my Department.  The specific needs of homeless children and young people under the age of 18 will be addressed by my colleague, Deputy Fahey, who has special responsibility for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the exceptional levels of growth continue in our economy, the needs of those on the margins of society are very much at the centre of Government <Col N="96" /> policy.  Provision for homelessness has improved greatly over recent years.  There is greater co-ordination and co-operation than ever before between all the agencies which deliver services to homeless people.  However, more needs to be done.  People still become homeless notwithstanding that there has been a consistent and long-standing effort on the part of the statutory and voluntary agencies to respond to the difficulties of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago Simon raised legitimate public concerns about homelessness with its assessment of the numbers of people sleeping rough in Dublin.  I understand its findings were the result of a week long survey of people availing of its outreach services and do not reflect the numbers of people sleeping rough on a nightly basis which is a much smaller number &mdash; less than 20 in any night in the view of Dublin Corporation.  Nevertheless, it is worrying that any homeless person should sleep rough in our city.  My Department has asked Dublin Corporation for an update on the numbers of people sleeping rough in the capital and I understand this is now being prepared.</P>
    <P>The causes of homelessness are complex and require complex responses.  Often there are factors which combine to push the vulnerable person or family over the brink into homelessness.  Unless there is a safety net of supports available at this critical stage, there is a danger that some vulnerable homeless people will slip into the world of crime and drug abuse.  There is some concern about recourse by drug addicts for accommodation to hostels and shelters where their arrival can sometimes introduce an element of disruption and even danger, and make other residents fearful.  It is an aspect of homelessness which requires special attention from the agencies and bodies dealing with homelessness and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The responses to homelessness, whether provided by a State agency or a voluntary body, must come into play promptly at the point when people have become homeless.  The longer a person is homeless the more difficult it is to break that cycle.  The intervention must focus on providing the supports which are needed to make the period of homelessness as short as possible and must involve the combined efforts of the various agencies and bodies in providing a full range of services.  No one agency is the sole provider of services to homeless persons nor can this ever be the case.  Shelter is a most basic requirement but, alongside shelter, will be the need for other services, such as training, health, psychological and other supports which will be needed to facilitate a homeless person's return to a more normal type of living.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, as far as accommodation is concerned, there is a good and flexible framework in place to provide a service to homeless people, both directly through local authorities and indirectly through the voluntary bodies.  The local authorities' powers to counter homelessness are broad and varied.  The most significant development, for many homeless people, especially families, has been the expanded local authority and social housing programme of recent years.  The Government has made a commitment <Col N="97" /> to maintain the programme at a high level.  Many homeless families have benefited directly through first time lettings in new houses or casual vacancies in existing houses.  For 1998, provision has been made for a programme of 3,900 new houses and the capital provision for the programme has been significantly increased.</P>
    <P>The various social housing measures also play an important part in meeting housing needs, including those of homeless people.  The voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, in particular, is used to provide accommodation of a high standard for homeless people as well as for other categories such as the elderly and the disabled. Since the scheme was introduced about ten years ago, some £37 million has been paid in respect of projects for homeless people.  Organisations such as Simon, Focus, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Respond and the Salvation Army have provided some 470 units of accommodation for homeless people under the scheme.  Some of these bodies have also provided accommodation for homeless persons under the separate rental subsidy scheme funded by the Department.  The range of voluntary housing measures, including the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes have been comprehensively improved by this Government with the aim of making them as attractive as possible to voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless people and other groups.</P>
    <P>In addition to the availability of capital funding to provide accommodation, there is need to provide more direct assistance to homeless people and the bodies working on their behalf.  Funding is needed to allow voluntary bodies to run their organisations and my Department makes an annual grant to a number of voluntary bodies, including Focus and the Simon Community National Office which work on behalf of homeless persons.  Funding is needed to help run hostels and provide emergency accommodation and to support accommodation referral services which are directly availed of by homeless persons.  The mechanism used for these purposes is section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have extensive powers under the Act to provide assistance to homeless persons and to the bodies working on their behalf, outside the traditional response of local authority housing.  This can take the form of funding for emergency bed and breakfast accommodation, funding the provision by voluntary bodies of accommodation and resettlement services for homeless persons and, in the Dublin region, funding the homeless persons and refugee units and the homeless initiative, which I will mention later.  In practice, health boards, which provide income support for homeless persons, are often involved in arranging accommodation for homeless persons so that, in many areas, combined arrangements involving the local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies are in operation.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities which I have spoken of are extensive in nature and my Department <Col N="98" /> has consistently stressed to authorities that they must use these powers to the fullest extent possible.  The use of these powers in a flexible way by authorities has increased over the years. Under the terms of the Act, 90 per cent of expenditure by local authorities on homelessness can be recouped from my Department.  As an indication of the extent to which authorities use their powers, the level of recoupment payable by my Department has increased significantly since the first years of operation of the provisions from £7,000 in 1989 to £6 million in 1997.  While a proportion of the 1997 funding relates to emergency accommodation for asylum seekers in the Dublin area, the level of increase in the provision for homelessness is still striking.  Recoupments by my Department to various local authorities in respect of payments to voluntary bodies are a crucial contribution to their capacity to respond effectively to the accommodation needs of homeless persons.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Dublin which has about two thirds of the national homeless population.  As the largest urban centre it will naturally have a greater number of homeless persons and may attract vulnerable people from other areas, particularly the surrounding counties, encouraged by hopes of a better life in the city.  There are aspects of homelessness in Dublin which are putting pressure on available emergency and hostel accommodation.  There is significant pressure on emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and, indeed, on the lower end of the private rented accommodation sector, by the large number of asylum seekers in the Dublin area.  These are classified as homeless and are placed in emergency accommodation until they move into rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>This development has seriously eroded the otherwise adequate supply of emergency accommodation available for homeless people and has made difficult the move by homeless persons from emergency and hostel accommodation into suitable alternative accommodation.  Dublin Corporation and the health board are monitoring this situation very closely to seek to ensure that there is always some form of accommodation available to homeless people who need it and are developing proposals to upgrade services for the homeless and to increase accommodation in the city.</P>
    <P>The Dublin local authorities and the Eastern Health Board have special arrangements in place to ensure services are accessible to homeless persons.  These include the operation of a drop-in daytime accommodation referral service and a phone-in service at night and at weekends.  Dublin Corporation provides transitional and emergency accommodation at its premises at Maple House on the North Circular Road and Marlborough Place and is upgrading its existing hostel at the Model Lodging House.  Capital funding for these is being provided by my Department.  We know the demand for emergency accommodation increases when the weather disimproves and for <Col N="99" /> this reason Dublin Corporation has put in place a &ldquo;cold weather strategy&rdquo; which aims to increase the short-term emergency accommodation available in hostels throughout the city to ensure no one who wants a bed for the night is without one.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the scale of homelessness in the Dublin area compared to other regions, the Dublin homeless initiative was established in late 1996 to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for homeless people in the Eastern Health Board region covering Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  It has a specific role in ensuring the development of responses to enable homeless people to become settled and to move out of the cycle of homelessness.  The aim is to develop an effective partnership between all the agencies involved in service provision for homeless people, both statutory and voluntary.</P>
    <P>A separate administrative structure has been established jointly between Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board to oversee and co-ordinate the provision of services.  There is a management group, comprising senior officials of Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board, and a consultative board, comprising representatives of the housing authorities in the region, the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary bodies in the region which provide services for the homeless.  An administrative director has been appointed by the management group to co-ordinate the work of the initiative.  The initiative receives its funding from Dublin Corporation, which is recouped by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.  Its total expenditure in 1997 was £600,000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the initiative is making an important contribution to the provision of services for the homeless in the Dublin area by building links and co-operation between the bodies involved, by defining the needs of homeless people and by taking a strategic view of how services should develop.  It has given priority to resettlement issues and is developing strategies to encourage homeless people in the direction of more normal living.  It is an important element in the array of responses to homelessness.</P>
    <P>The concept of partnership is the main strength of the homeless initiative.  All local authorities have been asked to develop strong links at local level with the health board and voluntary bodies working in their areas.  Co-ordination is already a feature of the services delivered locally to homeless people.  Nevertheless, there is scope for enhanced co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors in other areas, especially in the major cities, to ensure the needs of homeless people are recognised and tackled in a co-ordinated way.  My Department has held discussions with Cork, Limerick and Galway city authorities to review the co-ordination arrangements in place between them and the respective health boards and voluntary bodies in their areas and to consider how these arrangements can be consolidated and extended.  I am confident this will bring <Col N="100" /> about improvements in the partnership arrangements for dealing with homelessness outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater and more well informed response to homelessness now than ever before.  There is often no quick or easy solution.  While meeting an immediate need, accommodation will not deal in every case with the overall problem.  Other factors, such as unemployment, family breakdown and alcohol or drug addiction are often involved.  We are fortunate to have so many voluntary bodies providing and operating accommodation and services for homeless people and dedicated to improving the living conditions of less well off people.  The development of the social housing programmes in recent years has increased the importance and significance of the voluntary sector contribution.  This should not be taken for granted.  It is important adequate and proper support is available to sustain this involvement.  This is the basis of the social housing schemes and of the funding, capital and current, available through my Department to sustain the effort to deal with homelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to put on record the Government's response to the problem of homelessness in so far as it impacts on children and young people.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, has dealt with the problem of homelessness in its wider context.  I propose to deal with the issue in so far as my responsibilities as Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are concerned.</P>
      <P>Homelessness among young people is a complex issue and like many, if not all, such issues, it does not lend itself to simple solutions.  Homelessness among children and young people is not a problem to be seen in isolation but is a symptom of other problems which relate to comparatively recent changes in Irish society.  We are experiencing difficulties in responding to the major changes which have taken place over the past 25 years or so.  These changes have been largely beneficial but they have also led to a dislocation in our society, with many of the assumptions on how society and the family should operate no longer accepted.  In a situation of such rapid change, it is to be expected that problems will emerge and one manifestation of this which impacts on children and young people is the problem of homelessness.  Young people have to face a range of challenges today of which my generation was happily oblivious, especially drug and substance abuse.  For young people who fall through the safety net, the end result can often be homelessness and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise this problem and understand how it occurred.  The challenge facing me and my colleagues in Government lies in responding to <Col N="101" /> the problem and bringing forward compassionate and realistic solutions designed to deal in a meaningful way with the underlying problems and also with the immediate problem as identified in the motion.</P>
    <P>First, there is a legislative underpinning to the response.  Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991 gives health boards the responsibility to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and to provide child care and family support services.  Section 5 of the Act requires health boards to make available suitable accommodation for children who are homeless and who have no accommodation they can reasonably occupy.  Section 8 requires health boards to carry out an annual review of the adequacy of the child care services in their areas, and this includes services dealing with homeless young people.</P>
    <P>Second, resources are being made available, although I admit not to the extent necessary. From 1993 to the end of 1997 an additional £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services, including services for the young homeless.  In 1998, an additional £8 million will be made available under this general heading, together with £5 million under a capital budget. This is a significant level of investment, although it is clear additional funding in this area would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Third, resources are being directed at the areas of greatest need.  The problem of homeless and out of home young people is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region, especially in the greater Dublin area where the number of out of home young people has escalated sharply over the last year.  On average, 12 young people per night present to the social work service operating outside normal office hours.  The Eastern Health Board estimates that in 1997 400 young people presented as being out of home in the region. Approximately 50 per cent of these young people are known to the Eastern Health Board services. A difficulty experienced by the out of hours service is that many young people, who cannot be placed by community care teams during the day because of a shortage of placements, present to the out of hours service at night.</P>
    <P>Since taking over my responsibilities in the Department of Health and Children, I have dealt with the problems in the Eastern Health Board as a priority issue and the board has responded with a package of measures which I will summarise briefly.  The board is in the process of creating more foster care and residential places in the region.  A ten bed emergency residential centre for children under the age of 12 is being set up. This centre will be operational on a 24 hour basis and will provide a workable alternative to social admissions to hospitals.</P>
    <P>The board intends opening an additional ten bed emergency residential centre for children over 12 years of age who are out of home.  Also up to ten emergency carer families are being <Col N="102" /> brought on stream at present.  These will be available to provide emergency care for children during the out of hours period.</P>
    <P>The board also operates a day project which offers care, welfare and recreation support to approximately ten young people who are considered to be at risk during daytime.  Plans are advancing for a day and night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate homeless young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services.  This will replace the current unsatisfactory arrangements whereby young people make contact with the Eastern Health Board out of hours service via Garda stations.  The reception centre will provide a base for the day project where meals can be provided as well as recreation, laundry and bathroom facilities.  This centre will have a small number of emergency beds available for young people where no other placement is available.</P>
    <P>All of these new services will come on stream this year.  To support these and other developments, I approved a special allocation of £2 million for the Eastern Health Board.  We also have proposals to open additional residential centres in joint ventures involving the private sector and volunteers who have come forward to assist in dealing with the crisis.</P>
    <P>Fourth, an integrated range of measures is being developed to prevent problems arising in the first place.  These include: early intervention to prevent children at risk from becoming homeless; greater provision of services for families and young people in the community; provision of suitable and varied accommodation; backup services for the young homeless and accommodation and support services for children leaving care.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, I identified the problem of homelessness and out of home young people as a priority requiring a concerted and immediate response.  I then moved to deliver practical and immediate responses to the problem and I intend to follow through and ensure that everything possible is done to find solutions to this complex and difficult problem which challenges us all.  This is one of the most serious and difficult problems facing society.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Opposition spokesperson who lambasted the Government for its lack of action.  This issue should not become a political football.  There was a serious lack of initiative on the part of the previous Government on this issue.  There is a major challenge facing us to come to grips with the problem.  It will take a massive amount of resources to deal with the numbers of children on the streets who are at risk and have no choice but to go onto the streets because of family difficulties.  This is a complex problem which will demand serious resources if it is to be tackled successfully.  We should speak with one voice to ensure that the resources, services and structures are provided to get the homeless off the streets of Dublin and into proper accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for tabling this motion and allowing the issue to be debated.  I pay tribute to the voluntary and statutory agencies involved in assisting the homeless. I also welcome the initiatives announced by Deputy Fahey concerning young, homeless people.  They are very worthwhile and he will have my full support in bringing them to fruition. I cannot say the same about Deputy Molloy who has responsibility for adult homeless people.  I have most experience of this area.</P>
      <P>The cost of housing means large numbers of people who previously could afford to buy a house with loans from local authorities, building societies and banks cannot now do so.  We should all agree that homelessness is unacceptable.  I served in a junior ministerial portfolio dealing with housing and I fully appreciate the urgency to tackle homelessness.</P>
      <P>A permanent home is a right not a privilege. However, in our booming economy it is unacceptable that more people than ever are forced to sleep on the streets because housing and even temporary shelter has become inaccessible. The increase in homelessness among young children is particularly alarming.  In this regard I welcome the initiatives announced by Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>The drug dependency rate among young homeless men in particular is also a cause of concern. In our major cities, voluntary organisations working with homeless people find it virtually impossible to provide temporary accommodation to those who seek it.  Since this Government took office nine months ago, only four residents from the Simon Community shelter in Dublin have been allocated local authority accommodation by Dublin Corporation.  The intention is that such accommodation is temporary and people living there will move to permanent accommodation provided by Dublin Corporation.  The small number who have done so is one of the reasons for the bottleneck in temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>This winter, most shelters and hostels have had to turn homeless people away nightly because of lack of accommodation.  Temporary accommodation has become permanent for people who are finding both the private and public housing sectors completely inaccessible, creating a bottleneck in the hostels.  The cost of homes means that young people are spending long periods in private rented accommodation.  There is plenty of evidence that this has given a licence to landlords to jack up rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing property has become one of the main attractions for speculators and investors.  The huge concessions in the budget have given the right of way to let this type of investment flourish. Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed that 50 per cent of housing units in tax incentive developments are owned by property investors.  In some areas such as the Customs House Harbour, no less than 90 per cent of the units are held by investors.  This type of mass speculation in new housing is blocking out the first time buyer and is allowing investors to set rental rates at levels <Col N="104" /> which are out of the reach of young families and those on low incomes.  It is not surprising that people are being forced onto the streets as they cannot find affordable accommodation.  Perusing the small advertisements in the <i>Evening Herald</i> I discovered that a one room flat costs between £65 and £100 per week.  Most specify the type of clientele sought &mdash; the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; pops up on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board region there is an upper ceiling of £45 per week on the type of accommodation which can be rented in order to secure a rent supplement.  There is no accommodation on offer for a single person who meets these requirements.  The assistance which the health board can give towards a housing deposit also falls far short of what is being requested in the market.  I am not certain that this matter is the responsibility of Deputy Molloy but the income limits which applied four years ago for health board rent subsidies are out of date because of the spiralling cost of housing and rented housing.  This needs to be urgently tackled. I saw a figure of £60 million quoted for rent subsidies but I am not sure if this was in the Eastern Health Board region or nationally.  While this is a very large amount, people, particularly single people, who cannot get a rent subsidy for private sector accommodation have to be given temporary accommodation, for example, in hostels, following which they may end up on the street.  This bottleneck may be one of the reasons for the crisis in this area.</P>
    <P>At the lower end of the private rented accommodation market people are being forced to pay over the top rents in exchange for slum conditions, leaving them vulnerable to homelessness. If we are to address this crisis in the private rented market we must curb mass investment in housing by speculators.  This involves streamlining stamp duty exemptions to first time buyers only and applying a 40 per cent capital gains tax to profits on the sale of houses, regardless of the concessions given in this area by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  Deputy McDowell will propose amendments along these lines to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In the private rented sector the lack of security of tenure is a major issue.  If this sector is to develop &mdash; it has been developed everywhere else in Europe &mdash; the issue of security of tenure must be addressed.  We cannot develop an adequate private rented sector, whether subsidised or otherwise, if a landlord has the right to give one month's notice for no reason to a good tenant.  If such a case goes to court the landlord will be granted an order for possession.  The law must be amended so that good tenants are given security of tenure.  I am not suggesting the law should protect bad tenants.  This is one of the main reasons the private rented sector has not been able to develop and people have been forced into occupier-ownership arrangements.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous Government some reforms were achieved in the private <Col N="105" /> rented accommodation sector through regulations which dealt with minimum standards of accommodation and required landlords to register with local authorities and issue rent books. Some tax relief was also afforded to tenants in this sector.  However, these provisions have not been enforced by local authorities.  I urge the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to take urgent action to ensure local authorities enforce the regulations made in this House by public representatives.</P>
    <P>A handful of private landlords are registered under the legislation.  When I was a member of a local authority we were required to enforce laws without adequate resources.  However, under these regulations the landlord is charged an annual fee which more than covers the cost of registration and an annual inspection.  While some landlords have registered under the legislation, many others have not.  Landlords who have not registered should not receive State aid by way of a rent subsidy.  I am not sure of the exact amount paid in rent subsidy but it is very large.  The regulations were put in place to protect tenants and build up an ethos of good tenancy which is also in the interests of the landlord and urgent action must be taken to ensure they are enforced.</P>
    <P>The Government must introduce these changes and urgently re-examine the social housing programme in an effort to address the increase in housing and rental costs.  There is a limit of £35,000 on the small dwellings loans given by local authorities.  However, this amount is only adequate to put a deposit on a house in County Kildare.  A few years ago the second-hand council house in which I live in County Kildare was worth £30,000, while today it is worth approximately £90,000.  Previously people who were just over the limit for a council house could obtain a loan from the council to buy a similar property.  However, they cannot even look at such houses now.  In many areas adjacent to Dublin people do not avail of local authority loan schemes as they are no longer adequate.  If we want to assist people in buying their own homes there is no point having a loan scheme people cannot use.  It may still be possible to buy a house for £30,000 in County Mayo from where I come originally but they are not too plentiful even there.  Urgent consideration must be given to the loan schemes to ensure they are of benefit to people.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, the waiting lists for public housing have swelled out of all proportion. People who would not previously have been allowed on to a council housing list because they qualified for a loan are now eligible for inclusion on it.  The length of time people have to wait for public housing is unacceptable.  To fortify this point I will give an example of a case in my area.</P>
    <P>There were 200 applications for ten houses which were recently allocated by Kildare County Council.  The following categories of persons were unsuccessful in obtaining a house: a married couple with six children who had been two years on <Col N="106" /> the waiting list and were in receipt of a rent allowance; a single mother with three children who was under notice to quit from her subsidised private rented accommodation and who had been six years on the waiting list &mdash; she has since been evicted and has had to move in with relatives; and a deserted wife with four children in subsidised rented accommodation who had been served with a court order to quit and who had been five years on the waiting list.  This woman, who is in her late fifties, has since received notice from the sheriff of the date of her eviction.</P>
    <P>The decision that these extreme cases of need did not merit allocation of a tenancy by Kildare County Council raises a number of questions.  Is the situation in County Kildare so bad that even these families cannot be accommodated?  Is the method of allocation of tenancies such that the most deserving cases are not given preference?  Will the evictions in these cases put even greater pressure on the already over-stretched hostel accommodation in the capital city?  When people who are unsuccessful in their housing applications in County Kildare make inquiries about their position they are told hostel accommodation will be found for them in Dublin.  I strongly urge the Minister to examine the method of housing allocation in County Kildare where there is no waiting list, no priority listing, no point system and little or no attempt has been made to enforce the law on rent books, minimum standards of accommodation or the registration of private landlords.</P>
    <P>Waiting list times are a problem for single people as only limited public and social housing is available for such clientele.  While building more houses to fulfil the current demand will go some way towards dealing with this problem, the administration of public housing needs to be addressed.  Plans to transfer the administration of rent supplement to housing authorities and to provide a one stop comprehensive housing service must be urgently addressed.  The lack of co-ordination between the various agencies which deal with housing is resulting in delays.  In particular there is a vital need for a single housing authority in urban centres.  Such an authority would co-ordinate planning, building and allocation of housing.  At present this work is being carried out by voluntary and statutory bodies.  In Dublin this would include divisions within the health boards, the voluntary housing scheme, and the corporation.</P>
    <P>In the short term we must deal with the need for emergency accommodation.  There is such a demand for short term and emergency accommodation that more and more people are being forced to sleep on the streets each night.  The lack of movement on accommodation is causing this crisis in emergency shelters.  People are staying in such shelters for sustained periods at the expense of others seeking immediate shelter.  An urgent examination of emergency shelter accommodation is necessary and beds must be freed up to cater for the rise in the number becoming homeless.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I am particularly concerned at the increase in child homelessness, an issue addressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey.  In the period 1996-97 the figures for child homelessness doubled and evidence suggests that the number of homeless children continues to increase at an unprecedented rate.  Many of these children are forced to become involved in petty crime and begging to survive owing to the lack of available emergency services.</P>
    <P>Drugs are a huge problem among homeless people.  It is estimated that up to 40 per cent of drug addicts are homeless.  Sleeping rough will only exacerbate their problems in the absence of proper support and care facilities, particularly for addicts with HIV.  For many homeless people drug abuse provides an escape from the disillusionment of living on the streets and the lack of progress being made in terms of accommodation provision.</P>
    <P>While there are no concrete figures concerning homelessness, we should differentiate between homelessness and sleeping rough.  As Minister I sought to ensure that anybody who needed a bed for a night could get it.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, said today that was the case now.  When I was Minister I argued that it was the case then but there has not been an increase in the number of places since I was Minister and there is an acceptance that there is an increase in the numbers requiring accommodation.  Various issues, including the refugee influx, have exacerbated the problem, particularly in Dublin city.  There is a need, therefore, for additional places.  If ten people sleeping rough can be found by the authorities, that is a relatively large number.  The Newbridge branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul built a shelter for the homeless when only one person was found sleeping rough in the area and the shelter accommodates 14 people.  At the end of one week all the places were filled by people who were sleeping rough and who could not previously be found. These are the critical category of people we must attend to, people who have fallen through all the nets.</P>
    <P>Accommodation was provided at Grangegorman and managed by soldiers because of the anti-social behaviour of those living there.  The people there could not be accommodated in normal hostels as they had psychiatric problems, were alcoholics and drug addicts and were violent towards others.  Deputy Albert Reynolds, as Taoiseach, ordered that special accommodation be provided for this type of person as well as for others.  I visited the accommodation there which was very rough but the people there would not die of exposure as had happened to two people in Dublin a short time earlier.  I want to pay tribute to Deputy Reynolds because that brought home sharply to people the nature of the problem and the difficulties dealing with it.  The problem <Col N="108" /> still exists, but Grangegorman, now run by the Salvation Army, has become a nicer place.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply will speak about the small group who are very noticeable because they sleep in the warmest place they can find out of doors, usually the doorways of large stores.  Those people are highly visible but constitute a relatively small number.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to count as homeless all those who sleep in hostels.  There are people living in the good, permanent accommodation in the upgraded Iveagh Hostel in Dublin for the past 30 years without a break.  Counting these as homeless is nonsense.  The Minister, his officials and the concerned agencies should come up with a new definition of homelessness.  It is exaggerating the problem to describe those with permanent accommodation as homeless.  It would be better to have a clear picture of the problem in order that we could more effectively target resources and deal with it.</P>
    <P>To adequately respond to the needs of the homeless we must take the bull by the horns and tackle the problem along the lines I have suggested.  A proper and full assessment of real homelessness is necessary to establish the exact numbers of homeless, whether they have special needs and are dependent on drugs or alcohol.  We must particularly address the growing problem of homelessness among children.  I appreciate the indications of movement by Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in this area and I will support his efforts.  I noted his plea for additional resources was guarded, as such pleas by Ministers of State must be.  I appreciate the need for additional resources in the area he mentioned as do the agencies with which he is working.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government must clearly identify the extent and causes of the problem.  If we do not do so, the end result will be future homelessness and needs for accommodation which did not previously exist.  I never remember a time when council houses cost five times the annual industrial worker's salary.  I do not know how purchase schemes, which are based on market value, are operating.  If they are genuinely based on market value I presume they have collapsed as no tenant of a council house could afford to purchase a house at current market prices.</P>
    <P>We must examine the system of loans which is no longer operable.  It is out of date and defunct in a large area of the country, including Dublin city, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Some new system for assisting people to buy their own houses is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I apologise for bringing the Minister, who is very busy on other matters, into <Col N="109" /> the House this evening but I am sure if he were operating from my vantage point he would do the same.  This question concerns a procedural matter to which I take strong exception.  I do not blame the Minister; it is simply part and parcel of a system that needs to be changed.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the subject matter of the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 24 February 1998 which asked the Minister for Finance the reason the commitment given in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 10 February 1998 was not honoured; his views on the practice of altering a document prior to issue; his views on whether this is a normal and acceptable practice; the reason a reference was made to the lack of a P60 when in fact this documentation was never requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>By way of background information I should explain that this is an ordinary matter where a constituent made an application for a higher education grant, a prerequisite to which is the issue of a P21 which is used in the determination of eligibility.  A P21 is a record of the income received and tax paid by the taxpayer.  In this case it was suggested that, because the taxpayer had not filed a written return of income, he would not receive the P21.  This person is entitled to that information regardless of whether he has filed a recent return.</P>
      <P>The important element is the reply to the question on 10 February, which asked the Minister for Finance the reason for the delay in the issue of a P21 in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare in view of the fact that he has an up to date P60 and has been in continuous PAYE employment for 15 years; and if he will state the normal criteria for the issue of a P21.  The reply stated:</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when the inspector of taxes received the application on the taxpayer's behalf for a P21, a PAYE balancing statement, she wrote to him and requested him to complete a return of income for the 1996-7 tax year and forward any supporting documents.</P>
      <P>In general, requests for balancing statements are dealt with as soon as possible by districts once the facts are established regarding total income and allowances.  Where the information on file is not current, taxpayers are normally asked to complete a return of income form.  [I dispute that.  That is not the norm.  ] In the particular circumstances of this case, the P21 will issue shortly in advance of receipt of a return of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is now a procedural matter.  The P21 did issue, but written across it were the words: &ldquo;This is a provisional document that has been prepared without sight of a P60 and without receipt of a return of income&rdquo;.  This was an altered document, yet nobody had the authority to alter it.  A commitment was given by the Minister to this House that the P21 would issue in a particular form. <Col N="110" /> That did not happen; it was qualified.  Nobody has the right to alter a commitment given by a Minister to the House.  Regardless of the circumstances, once that commitment is made by the Minister in good faith, nobody has the authority to alter it.  I challenge anybody to dispute that.</P>
    <P>This constituent has been in the same employment for the past 15 years or more.  He has not had any difficulty in making a return of income and he indicated to the section in question that there was no difficulty provided he received the P21 as requested.</P>
    <P>Altering or in any way deviating from a commitment given in a reply to a parliamentary question is a serious procedural matter.  It should not be necessary for me to bring the Minister into the House on a matter of this nature but I hope he will take account of it and remedy the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising the matter this evening.  Matters relating to Kildare North are important for the good of the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As regards what happened in this particular case, I understand the Deputy wrote to the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle on 19 December 1997 on behalf of a constituent who was applying for an education grant and requested a P21 on his behalf and on behalf of his father.</P>
      <P>It is important in responding to the Deputy's request to outline the normal procedure regarding the issue of a P21.  The P21 is a balancing statement issued normally on request by a taxpayer when the taxpayer is delivering his annual return.  Based on the figures in the return and on the form P35 received by Revenue directly from the taxpayer's employer, the inspector is able to calculate the final tax position for the tax year and to indicate to the taxpayer the final figure in respect of income and allowances, any claims for exemptions and reliefs and ultimately whether tax was underpaid or overpaid for the year.</P>
      <P>However, the P60, which is issued by the employer directly to the employee, is the form on which employees rely to clarify their income position and should be lodged by them with their return annually.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the normal practice is to issue a P21 on receipt of a completed return of income.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's letter of 19 December was referred to the constituent's local inspector of taxes.  The inspector wrote to the Deputy's constituent on 13 January 1998 asking him to complete a form 12 &mdash; return of income &mdash; for 1996-7 together with any supporting documents, i.e., certificate of home loan interest paid in the year ended 5 April 1997, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter also requested details of the constituent's son's RSI number and ended by stating that, on receipt of a full reply, the inspector hoped to be in a position to issue a PAYE balancing statement for 1996-7 and to advise the relevant inspector of taxes to issue the same to the constituent's son.  On 19 January 1998, a letter <Col N="111" /> was sent to the Deputy informing him that the inspector had written to his constituent in the above terms.</P>
    <P>At this point, I understand the Deputy contacted the official in the Revenue Commissioners head office in Dublin Castle who had issued that letter and discussed the matter with him.  I understand the Deputy made the point that he was unhappy that the inspector was insisting on the completion of a return of income before the issuing of the P21 and that the Deputy considered that the inspector was not entitled to attach such a precondition to the issue of the P21.</P>
    <P>Following further discussions between Revenue's head office and the local inspector, it emerged that no return had been received from the Deputy's constituent for approximately ten years and that the inspector did not consider that there was sufficient information available to issue the P21 in the absence of a return.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy pressed the issue strongly and on being informed that the P21 would not issue declared his intention of putting down a parliamentary question on the matter and subsequently put down two parliamentary questions for written answer on 10 February 1998.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the notice of the parliamentary questions, Revenue's head office contacted the Deputy to discuss the matter further with him. I understand that again the Deputy insisted the inspector did not have the right to refuse to issue the P21.  However, I understand that in the course of that conversation the Deputy stated that he had no difficulty with the idea of completing a tax return but not necessarily in advance of the issue of the P21.</P>
    <P>It also emerged at that stage that, as Revenue understands it, the Deputy was more interested in the figures which would emerge from the P21 than the idea that it should be a final balancing statement showing an underpayment or over-payment of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context the Revenue Commissioners agreed to issue a P21 on the basis of the figures available to the inspector in advance of the receipt of the return, and my reply to the Deputy's first question on 10 February was issued on that basis.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy, on receiving that reply, contacted the Revenue Commissioners again expressing his dissatisfaction.  I understand also that he acknowledged that the information on the P21 was what was required by his constituent but that he could not accept the endorsement showing that it was not final and that if a clear P21 was not issued, he would put down a further parliamentary question and, if necessary, raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy put down a further parliamentary question for answer on 24 February:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> To ask the Minister for Finance the reason the commitment given in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 10 February 1998 was not honoured; his views on the practice of altering a document prior to issue; his views on whether this is a normal and acceptable practice; the reason a reference was made to the lack of a P60 when in fact this documentation was never requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The reply states:</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 10 February 1998, form P21 (Balancing Statement) issued to the taxpayer in advance of receipt of a return of income.  I am further informed by the Commissioners that the last return of income completed in the particular case was at least ten years ago.  The inspector of taxes did not have current information for the case other than the fact that the taxpayer had an employment subject to PAYE.  In the particular circumstances, the inspector has no option but to endorse the P21 accordingly.</P>
    <P>On receipt of a return of income and supporting documentation (which would normally include the P60) a final balancing statement, if required, will be issued immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate very much the Deputy's position on behalf of his constituent and in particular that he is a compliant PAYE taxpayer on a relatively modest wage, I hope the Deputy will accept that the inspector in this instance was quite within her rights to insist on a return of income being lodged and that on receipt of such return a clear P21 would have been issued quickly.</P>
      <P>I also trust the Deputy will accept that the issue of the P21 and the reply to his question of 10 February were done in good faith and in the expectation and understanding that the Deputy's requirements and those of his constituents would be satisfied.  The Deputy's constituent's return of income has not yet been received by Revenue and I assure him that on receipt of a completed return of income the final P21 will issue immediately to his constituent.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Finlay Tribunal of Inquiry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this urgent matter tonight.  Yesterday a legal case was taken by a Dublin consultant to challenge the findings of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry.  The case was not contested by the State, despite assurances given to Positive Action to the contrary and despite the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 20 March 1997 that &ldquo;The Government will not seek to resile from or repudiate any of the findings of fact of the tribunal report in any proceedings in court&rdquo;. Refusal to act in accordance with this commitment has serious implications for the Finlay tribunal and for all tribunals.  The State did not contest the case made by the consultant, Dr. Kirrane, which undermines the report.  The State so far has refused to reconvene the Finlay tribunal to deal with the point of contention in a fair way and a way that ensures the integrity of the report. Because of a technicality Dr. Kirrane won his case and no one questions his right to have recourse to the law.  Equally, the State has a duty to protect the public interest and in this case it has singularly failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal was established to investigate the single biggest health scandal in the history of the State.  The report deals with the scandal that led to the suffering of many victims who bravely and tenaciously sought the truth.  The report is now being excised to the point where it is damaged unless Government action is taken.  Only a reconvening of the tribunal will elicit the full truth in accordance with the law.  That is the action the Minister for Health and Children should have taken in preparation for this court case, but instead he did nothing and the State came out with its hands up and surrendered without a fight. The State has argued that its role precludes it from taking an active role in the court case, yet it <Col N="114" /> is the State that is revising and reprinting the report and paying the legal costs.  The State, therefore, has a role but it argues it has no role.</P>
    <P>I would use the phrase the Minister used in Opposition when he spoke about Chinese walls being erected to prevent access to the truth. Surely he is guilty of obscuring his authority and his responsibility by erecting Chinese walls.  He has made no statement on the issue and clearly has no intention of doing so, given that he is not here to reply to this Adjournment debate.  It is regrettable that yet again on an important health issue the Minister is not in the House.</P>
    <P>As late as last Friday the Chief State Solicitor informed Positive Action in writing: &ldquo;We have been instructed to inform you that the tribunal/Justice Finlay are not attempting to do anything to excise or squash part of the report of the tribunal&rdquo;.  It is no wonder members of Positive Action were horrified that the court case went ahead without the tribunal, Judge Finlay or the State putting up a defence or providing an alternative strategy.  How can Positive Action maintain a relationship of trust with the Government when it is given such misleading information?</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister for Health and Children to secure the integrity of the Finlay tribunal report in court is more shocking in view of the decision made today by the Cabinet to ask the Oireachtas to change the legislation to secure the working of the Flood tribunal.  While the Cabinet is making unprecedented efforts to support one tribunal, the Minister for Health and Children is washing his hands of another tribunal, one which dealt literally with a matter of life and death. Surely the Minister must be aware of the message sent out by this inconsistency, that rezoning of land is more important than people's health, that human suffering caused by neglect, ignorance and negligence is of lesser consequence than the possible grubby connection between land speculation in north Dublin and some politicians.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children must answer the following questions.  Why did the State not undertake to reconvene the Finlay tribunal as requested by Positive Action?  Why did the State not contest the case taken in court by the Dublin consultant?  How does the Minister intend to deal with the unresolved issue that has been excised from the report and which will, unless addressed, undermine the status of the report?  The victims who have fought long and hard for the truth to be revealed have a right to full and comprehensive answers to those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.  I apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I wish to confirm to the House that the High Court yesterday made an order quashing so much of the report of the tribunal of inquiry into <Col N="115" /> the Blood Transfusion Service Board which concluded that Dr. James Kirrane bore some responsibility for the contamination of blood products by failing to insist on a greater investigation of the reaction of patients to the anti-D blood product.  The order also declared such parts of the report to be void and of no effect.  The judge also directed the registrar of the court to inform the Medical Council of the terms of the order.  It has been agreed that appropriate notices will be placed in the national newspapers and that a correction will be prepared for insertion in copies of the report.</P>
      <P>The background to the matter lies in an application for judicial review initiated by Dr. Kirrane last summer.  Dr. Kirrane claimed that his constitutional right to basic fairness of procedure and/or the rules of natural justice had been violated by the tribunal on a number of grounds.  In particular he claimed that he had not been afforded notice that allegations or criticisms had been levelled against him; he had not been afforded formal right of representation and was not given the right to cross-examine witnesses giving evidence adverse to him; he was not furnished with transcripts of evidence relevant to his interests; he was not afforded an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the evidence and he was never informed that any allegation had been made against him or that the tribunal might come to an adverse conclusion in respect of his conduct.  Consequently he was not in a position to place evidence or argue against such an adverse conclusion.</P>
      <P>He further claimed that the criticisms of him contained in the report were not factually sustainable and were irrational and unreasonable in law.  He claimed that his professional and personal good name and reputation had been gravely prejudiced and impugned by the report.  Among the reliefs he sought were orders quashing those parts of the report which contained criticisms of him and declaring such parts of the report to be void and of no effect, a declaration that he was not in any way responsible for or contributed to the contamination of blood products and damages against Ireland and the Attorney General for breach of constitutional rights to fair procedures and to good name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proceedings were taken against Mr. Justice Finlay, in his capacity as sole member of the tribunal of inquiry, and against Ireland and the Attorney General.  In accordance with normal procedures, the Chief State Solicitor's Office sought counsel's opinion on behalf of Ireland and the Attorney General.  Counsel's advice was that it would not be appropriate for the Attorney General to take a view one way or the other on the question of whether the proceedings before the tribunal, in so far as the applicant was concerned, were or were not conducted in accordance with the rules of natural justice; that was seen to be a matter for the tribunal itself.  I might <Col N="116" /> add that this position was accepted by the judge in the High Court yesterday.</P>
    <P>As far as Mr. Justice Finlay is concerned, I understand that, having considered the statement of claim and taken legal advice, he indicated in his notice of opposition that he did not oppose the making of the order sought in relation to the quashing of the relevant parts of the report and a declaration that such parts were void and of no effect.  When the matter came before the court yesterday, I understand that counsel for Dr. Kirrane indicated that, having regard to the position that had been adopted by Mr. Justice Finlay, his client would not proceed with his claim for damages or his claim for a declaration of non-cul-pability.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the resolution passed by the House on 20 March last in relation to the tribunal's report which included a paragraph noting that the Government will not seek to &ldquo;resile from or repudiate any of the findings of fact in the tribunal report in any proceedings either in court or before the compensation tribunal.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks how this can be reconciled with what happened in the High Court yesterday.  I wish to make a number of points.  It is fair to say that when the House passed that resolution it was not to the fore of our minds that an action such as that taken by Dr. Kirrane was likely to happen.  What was intended by the paragraph in question was that the State would not resile from or repudiate the tribunal's findings in the context of any claims for damages or compensation being taken by persons affected by the contamination of blood products, whether such claims were being pursued in the courts or before the compensation tribunal.  This undertaking, initially given by the previous Administration, has been honoured in full by the Government and this will continue to be the case.  What happened in the High Court yesterday will not affect the State's approach to claims for compensation set out in the report of the Minister for Health and Children on the legal strategy in the McCole case which was published last August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has attempted to criticise the Government for its alleged failure to contest the case taken by Dr. Kirrane.  This is to misunderstand the nature of the relationship between the Government and the tribunal.  The tribunal was not a creature of the Government; it was a creation of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would have been totally inappropriate for the Government to try to exert influence on the tribunal in regard to how it conducted its investigation or on the findings, conclusions or recommendations which it formed.  In the same way, it would be improper for the Government to seek to influence the response of the tribunal to these proceedings. <Col N="117" /> The fact is that the tribunal chairman felt that he could not oppose the claims made by Dr. Kirrane on the criticism of him in the report.  Having regard to the separation of powers, the State did not regard itself as being a proper party to oppose the claims.  I gather it was clear from what was said by the presiding judge that he agreed with this position.  In those circumstances, it is difficult to see what other attitude the State could have taken in respect of those matters.  Either the State has or has not a role in such matters.  If it has not got a role, then it cannot legitimately interfere in those aspects of the proceedings between an applicant and the tribunal.  To suggest that it does have a role would be to suggest that the State itself could have interfered legitimately in what was to happen to the report.</P>
    <P>The order was not made on consent but by the judge himself taking into account, of course, the fact that the tribunal chairman had indicated that he did not oppose same.  However, it remains the case that the judge was satisfied that it was appropriate to make the order concerned in the light both of the facts set out in the grounding affidavit and the fact that the tribunal, whose order was sought to be quashed, did not consider it appropriate to oppose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the State should have sought to reconvene the Finlay tribunal, I wish to make the following observations. First, I understand that Mr. Justice Finlay is of the view that he is <i>functus officio,</i> that is, he has completed his task and it is not open to him to reopen the tribunal.  Second, it is not in the power of the Minister for Health and Children, or indeed the Government, to refer a matter back to the tribunal.  Third, the court's jurisdiction in this case did not extend to requiring that the tribunal be reconvened or to ordering that a new tribunal be established to deal with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for attending the House because this is a difficult and topical issue.  Irish consumers are, by and large, well protected from unscrupulous trading and commercial practices.  The Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, have given them considerable protection and provide for redress where a consumer is dissatisfied with a product or service. The Director of Consumer Affairs and the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited play an invaluable role in representing and advocating the interests of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the interests of consumers need protecting.  Daily we are all faced with competing messages from companies urging us to buy their <Col N="118" /> goods and services and we exercise our freely given right to prefer one supplier or service provider to another.  It is important in making these choices that we, as consumers, are not placed under unfair or subtle pressures to influence our decisions.  The regime operated by the Advertising Standards Authority plays an important role in ensuring that we are not misled by inaccurate advertising.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have seen the re-emergence of marketing promotion involving schools where companies promise to provide free sponsorship of much needed equipment in return for vouchers obtained from the company's outlets.  I refer specifically to the Tesco computers for schools promotion.  This scheme involves parents receiving a voucher for every £10 spent at Tesco owned stores.  The schools are urged to collect the vouchers and when sufficient vouchers are gathered, the schools exchange them for equipment.</P>
    <P>The promotion was launched in February 1998. Every school received a pack directly from Tesco which included pre-printed circulars from the school to parents.  These were printed on paper carrying the Tesco logo and slogan.  Many schools sent these requests to parents, seeking the vouchers.  To obtain a free computer and software, parents of children in the school must spend up to £170,000 on grocery products in Tesco owned stores.</P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with commercial enterprises, large or small, engaging schools in straightforward sponsorship or promotional activities.  It is commendable that so many companies become involved with schools, through sponsoring competitions, producing educational packs on matters of relevance to the curriculum or placement programmes.  However, there is a distinction to be drawn between bona fide sponsorship initiatives and initiatives with strings attached.  It is not right that children should put pressure on parents to collect vouchers or tokens from a particular retailer or any other business. In this case, it involves putting pressure on the children of the 75 per cent of parents who do not currently shop in Tesco owned stores.  It also places unfair pressure on teachers and it can have divisive effects in some communities given the school's existing relationship with the local retailers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science introduced at least two circulars dealing with the issue of commercial exploitation of schools.  Circular 23/84 requested school management authorities to consider carefully the implications of allowing any situation to develop which would result in parents being put under pressure that would be prejudicial to the interests of the pupils. Circular 7/87 again cautioned school authorities against allowing any situation to develop which would result in parents being put under pressure to purchase a particular product.</P>
    <P>Promotions in schools which directly link sponsorship with purchases are wrong.  The existing guidelines are inadequate and a new guideline <Col N="119" /> from the Minister is needed.  No position should be allowed to develop where a commercial undertaking's sponsorship of a school is intrinsically linked with the parents of children at that school making purchases from the undertaking.  It places unfair pressure on parents, teachers and pupils. We should work towards and encourage genuine interaction between schools and business. However, it should be a relationship with no strings attached.  If businesses wish to bestow largesse on schools, they should not extract a price for doing so.  Schools should not be used by any commercial enterprise, local, national or international, as a marketing device to acquire customers.  They are a wholly inappropriate forum for commercial matters.</P>
    <P>By introducing a new circular on this issue, the Minister will ensure that children in schools will never again be subjected to unfair commercial pressures from businesses.  He will also ensure that parents will not be subjected to similar resultant pressure from their children.  Ultimately, he will ensure that consumers will make their purchasing decisions without being subjected to additional unfair and subtle pressure from commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>This venture is less about getting computers into schools and more about getting customers into Tesco owned shops.  It is a case of a commercial company using children to place unfair pressure on their parents.  Children are coming home in tears because their friends are supplying vouchers and they cannot do so if their parents do not shop in TesCo. The Minister should not have allowed himself and his Department to promote a Tesco expansion plan, particularly in view of its ban on Irish beef in Britain.  Two Ministers travelled to Britain this week to beg Tesco to put Irish beef back on the shelves.  The Minister's intentions were admirable, but there is something wrong and I ask him to redress the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to clarify the existing policy of the Department of Education and Science on such matters.  Implicit in the Deputy's matter is the exploitation of schools, their pupils and parents by companies in pursuit of opportunities to expand market share.  I assure the Deputy that the use of educationally linked promotional activity with such solely commercial motives cannot be condoned under any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the commercial world, private companies are free to promote their businesses in accordance with accepted marketing practices, such as the provision of vouchers which can be redeemed for a variety of purposes.  There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and potential customers.  I recognise the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking <Col N="120" /> schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity.  However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives of the type highlighted by the Deputy provided such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of requiring additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that official circulars were issued by the Department in 1984, 1987 and 1991 to the management authorities and principals of primary and second level schools concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools.  The circulars noted the Minister's concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.  I have no difficulty reiterating these sentiments to schools in light of the Deputy's comments.  I will be glad to take up any matters of which he is aware in the context of the information he revealed to the House.</P>

      <P>The circulars impress on school authorities the need to consider carefully the implications of allowing situations to develop which would result in parents being put under undue pressure to purchase particular commercial products.  The co-operation of school authorities is requested in taking steps to eliminate any undesirable practices in this regard and in formulating agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that due vigilance already exists in relation to the matter he raised.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's concerns may be related to a recent initiative whereby computers would be provided to schools on the basis of a voucher system.  He will undoubtedly be aware of the major policy decision taken by the Government in relation to a fund of over £250 million for scientific and technological education which is now established in statute.</P>

      <P>A key area to be supported by the fund is the IT 2000 initiative in primary and second level schools which the Taoiseach and I launched in November 1997.  In achieving the objectives of this ground breaking initiative, which include the provision of 60,000 computers in primary and second level schools by 2001 and connection to the Internet for every school allied to the creation of a special school Internet facility, significant emphasis is placed on partnership as a key element of its success.  The State will contribute £40 million between now and 2001. <Col N="121" /> The Government is also seeking partnerships with bodies that can add value to this investment.</P>

      <P>Such partnerships will have a number <Col N="122" /> of different strands and strategies.  They will envisage developments at national, regional and local levels and can be entered into voluntarily. One of the objectives of the partnership approach is the development of the equipment base in schools which will enable them to gain from the many other activities and opportunities associated with the IT 2000 initiative.  The placing of undue prohibitions, as sought by the Deputy, on potential partners in this important work would be contrary to the spirit of this innovative collaboration between Government, public and private sector organisations and schools.  It would also have the potential to deprive over 500,000 school-going children and young people of the benefits of this most significant, educationally sound and inclusive investment in schools under the IT 2000 initiative since the introduction of free post-primary education.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to an earlier question in relation to ACC and ICC Banks, the Government authorised me to enter into consultations with the boards, management and staff of these banks, with a view to developing detailed proposals on the future structure and ownership of the banks, in a way which would recognise the interests of all stakeholders, including the taxpayer.  I held meetings with the management and staff of the banks on 8 December 1997 and there are continuing contacts between my officials and the bank management and staff unions.  I am currently awaiting formal submissions from the staff unions in both banks.  I expect to receive these shortly, at which stage I will assess the position with a view to bringing definitive proposals before the Government.</P>
      <P>As regards the TSB, the position remains that, under the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Government has the power to initiate any change in the status of TSB.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Treating such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  Long-term social welfare payments have been taxable for many years.  Taxation was extended to disability benefit, DB, and unemployment benefit, UB, in 1993 and 1994 respectively.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the exemption limits and allowances can normally be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>Taxable social welfare payments are paid gross by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, i.e. without tax being deducted. The method of taxing long-term social welfare payments is that an amount equivalent to the annual social welfare payment is deducted from the taxpayer's full tax-free allowances at the start of the tax year, thereby avoiding a build up of arrears.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case of short-term DB and UB it is not possible, in certain instances, to avoid a build up of arrears of tax occuring at the end of tax years.  In the case of persons with tax-free allowances lower than the taxable amount of DB or UB, a tax liability is generated on the excess of the taxable benefit over the tax-free allowances for each week the person is in receipt of DB or UB.  This would mainly affect married couples where the couple's tax-free allowances, other than the PAYE allowance, are allocated to one spouse.  If the spouse, who is eligible for short-term DB or UB, ceases or returns to employment the only tax-free allowance available to that spouse is the PAYE allowance of £800.  It would not be possible to collect the tax due during the year in those circumstances and the matter must be deferred until after the end of the year.</P>
      <P>When arrears of tax do arise at the end of a tax year the Revenue Commissioners adopt a sympathetic approach with regard to the collection of such arrears.  Normally the payment of the arrears can be spread over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Taxation at source by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of such payments would, of course, avoid the build up of tax arrears.  However, in October 1995 the previous Government decided to defer plans for the introduction of taxation at source of short-term social welfare payments for the reasons explained by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in his reply to the Deputy of 4 February 1998.</P>

      <P>The budget estimate for the expected yield from capital gains tax in 1998 is £104 million.</P>
      <P>The number of assessments made in 1996 is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be approximately 4,530 cases.  This number relates to the number of assessments raised in that year and does not necessarily relate to the net receipts for that year.</P>

      <P>Following the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case of Hellen Gerster v.

      <P>The calculation of, and use of, seniority is, in general, a matter for each head of Department. However, Departments were also advised that the Gerster judgment means that it is not permissible, in general, under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, to reckon job sharing service as anything other than fully equivalent to full-time service for seniority lists used for the purposes of promotion or other similar purposes. Departments were requested to amend their seniority lists, if necessary.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the capital gains on the disposal of land and property.  It is tentatively estimated that the yield in 1997 to the Exchequer from capital gains tax on the disposal of land and property by individuals, including disposals of development land by both individuals and companies, was about £30 million.</P>
      <P>Corresponding figures for disposals of land and property other than development land by the corporate sector are not readily available as these are collected as part of the overall corporation tax take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Profits earned from dealing in property as a trade, as distinct from disposing of assets, are liable to income tax or corporation tax rather than capital gains tax.  Information from corporation tax and income tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide a corresponding estimate of the tax yield arising <Col N="127" /> from trading in property by companies and individuals, or on the corporate capital gains arising from the disposal of land and property other than development land.  To obtain the information it would be necessary to identify the cases and extract the information manually.  Such an exercise could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

      <P>Ministers had an informal exchange of views, over lunch, at the ECOFIN meeting of 16 February 1998 with Mr. Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, on the financial crisis in Asia, its background and possible lessons to be drawn from it regarding the restructuring of the international financial system.</P>
      <P>Discussions covered, <i>inter alia,</i> the need for a reform of banking supervision in certain regions as well as for a code of good conduct ensuring transparency and openness on economic and financial policies, the role of the private sector and the need to take into account social consequences of the programmes to deal with the crisis.</P>
      <P>The discussion led to the Council to underpin the need for greater transparency, the importance of working on a code of conduct or of good practice as well as reform of banking surveillance, the will of the European Union to promote good governance, the reform of international financial institutions and the importance of ensuring that IMF programmes should not have negative social repercussions in the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>The matters raised in the discussion with Mr. Camdessus were considered further at the G7/G8 meeting in London on 21-22 February 1998 and will be further discussed at the ASEM II Summit in London at the beginning of April as well as in the framework of the IMF Interim Committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's economic forecasts for the period 1998-2000 inclusive were presented in the <Col N="128" /> Economic Background to the Budget publication circulated to the House on 3 December 1997. These projected volume increases in GNP of 7 per cent for 1998, 5.7 per cent for 1999 and 4.9 per cent in the year 2000.  These forecasts were presented against the background of the favourable international outlook of reasonable prospects for growth in continental Europe and continued subdued inflationary pressures in the OECD.</P>
    <P>As with all economic forecasts, there are risks associated with this outlook, and these risks were adverted to at paragraphs 2.6 to 2.9 of the Economic Background to the Budget:</P>
    <P>The most immediate (risk) arises from the emerging shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour.  If not dealt with, these shortages have the potential to bring the current strong growth phase to a premature end.  Tackling the changing needs of the labour market will be one of the most important features of Government policy over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Another risk is that the current economic success may generate excessive pay demands and/or unrealistic expectations for improvements in a wide range of public services.  This would undermine the conditions for sustained economic growth; in these buoyant conditions, it is essential that expectations are contained. The risk that international developments and/or current uncertainties in international financial markets could result in slower growth must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>If inflationary pressures are not contained, there will be a loss in competitiveness and, ultimately, lower economic and employment growth.  Accordingly, it is essential that the moderate pay terms of Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness be strictly observed to ensure that inflationary pressures are minimised.</P>
    <P>House prices have escalated dramatically over the last two years, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of disposable incomes.  While the impact of this has been mitigated by reduced interest rates, the current rate of house price increases is of particular concern.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the overall macro-economic policies which the Government is pursuing will create the conditions necessary for continued economic growth.  We are using the good economic conditions to move to a budget surplus while reducing the tax burden, providing for increased resources in the area of social inclusion and meeting the investment needs of our economy.</P>
    <P>The next review of the prospects for the Irish economy in 1998 will be published by my Department in Economic Review and Outlook in July next and this will take account of all relevant developments in the domestic and international economy. <Col N="129" /> As regards particular sectoral areas of policy such as housing, which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who also has responsibility for transport in conjunction with the Minister for Public Enterprise and other relevant Ministers, all my colleagues are very much aware of the link between successful targeting of resources and the pursuit of appropriate policies across all sectors, and the performance of the economy in the medium term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 154, 156 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The principal decision making body of the European Central Bank will be the governing council, which will comprise the members of the executive board of the ECB together with the governors of the national central banks of the participating member states &mdash; in Ireland's case, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding appointments to the executive board of the ECB, the Maastricht Treaty lays down the procedure for the appointment of the board.  The relevant Articles of the Treaty are 109a and 109l, together with Article 50 of Protocol (No. 3) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  When the executive board of the ECB is being established, the president, the vice-president and the other members shall be appointed <Col N="130" /> by common accord of the governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council of the European Monetary Institute.</P>
    <P>The members of the board shall be appointed from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters.</P>
    <P>The number of members on the executive board is set at six, including the president and vice-president.  However, the number of members on the board may be reduced to a minimum of four, if there are member states which have derogations and are not proceeding to the third stage of EMU.  The composition of the board, therefore, cannot be considered formally by ECOFIN until the decision on who is to participate in the third stage has been taken during the first weekend of May this year.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware of the importance of ensuring that appointments to the executive board are made in a way that ensures its overall competence for its tasks and, at the same time, serves the interests of Ireland and the Union as a whole.</P>
    <P>While there has been much media speculation and I understand that some member states have expressed a general interest in their nationals being represented on the executive board, I would point out that, as of 2 March, I am not aware that any names have been formally put forward for any of the seats on the executive board, other than for that of the president.</P>
    <P>I have not had direct discussions with Prime Minister Blair in connection with the composition of the executive board, nor have I raised Ireland's representation on the executive board with the President of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in section 26 of the 1997 Finance Act for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas.  The airports in question are Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo and Waterford regional airports.</P>
      <P>The legislation states that the designation order will be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that in May 1997, in the context of State aids, the Competition Directorate of the EU Commission sought detailed information on the new tax reliefs for regional airports and new enterprise areas provided in the 1997 Finance Act.  This was on foot of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> publicising the new schemes.  The Commission then initiated a full investigation into all the enterprise areas, including those six enterprise areas developed under the 1994 Finance Act.  Last December, the Commission decided to approve the tax reliefs for the enterprise areas in the context of State aids but the decision did not cover the regional airports enterprise areas scheme.  However, when projects for the airports enterprise areas are approved by the Irish authorities and areas are then designated, they will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the enterprise areas for the regional airports, I am not considering the designation of any further enterprise areas.  It should be noted that from now on EU approval will be required for any such designations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The IMF has adopted a series of programmes to deal with the current crisis in South East Asia.  Ireland supports these programmes and, in particular, those conditions attached to them which are designed to protect the poor and eliminate aspects of the system where these have hitherto operated to the benefit of certain sections of society.  There are two aspects to these programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is financial.  Under the programmes, the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and a number of bilateral donors are making funds available to those countries which have requested them, namely, Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.  In the case of the IMF, funding takes the form of a stand-by facility which can be drawn down by the country concerned on a schedule and on conditions to be agreed with the IMF.  This <Col N="132" /> facility is essentially a line of credit.  In the case of the World Bank, funding is mainly in the form of technical assistance loans.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the programmes is the policy conditions which go with the financing. These are extensive and are designed to address the immediate crisis, control any contagion effects and deal with the longer term structural reforms which are now seen to be necessary to restore stability and economic growth.</P>
    <P>While the design of the IMF supported programmes in these countries reflects both the similarities and the differences in their situations, all three programmes have called for a substantial rise in interest rates to attempt to halt the downward spiral of currency depreciation.  All three programmes have called for forceful, up-front action to put the financial system on a sounder footing as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also an insistence that the brunt of any budgetary action required to restrain public expenditure should not fall on the poorer sections of the communities.</P>
    <P>The programmes are also subject to review in terms of the feasibility of carrying out the policy prescriptions under conditions as they develop and the IMF is taking a constructive approach to the implementation of the conditions.  Having said that, the IMF's view is that the problems need to be tackled quickly.</P>
    <P>On the financial front, the assistance being provided is not a bail-out.  The funding provided is by way of loans and not grants.  IMF assistance has been provided in support of programmes that are designed to deal with the causes and consequences of economy wide, structural imbalances and the potential threats these imbalances pose to the international monetary system.  Under the conditions of these programmes, commercial banks and private investors are not being protected from financial losses.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the IMF and its share in the capital of this institution is about 0.4 per cent of the total.  Ireland has not made any contributions to the IMF specifically earmarked for the three South East Asian countries.  The IMF contribution to this programme is primarily by way of a stand-by loan which is not a grant and which will have to be repaid.  The loan, to the extent it is taken up, will involve the general resources of the fund and consequently a share of the Irish quota, in common with the quotas of all the other members of the fund.  The use of the quota in this way does not represent any additional cost to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The World Bank finances around 94 per cent of its lending from borrowing on the world market.  The remaining 6 per cent of its funding comes from the capital subscriptions of its members.  Ireland's share in the bank's capital is about 0.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>There would, therefore, be no specific additional cost to Ireland as a result of the IMF and World Bank programmes in response to the Asian crisis.</P>

However, the Government has not yet formally considered what form the millennium celebrations will take or what level of resources will be made available to that end.

      <P>It is not immediately apparent what particular issues currently facing the banking system the Deputy is referring to in his question.  Probably the greatest challenge facing Irish banks at this time is EMU. The introduction of the euro will, of course, have a major impact on the banking sector.  The Irish Bankers' Federation, IBF, in co-operation with the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, IMSA, has established a structure to plan and oversee preparations for the changeover to the euro.  This structure is headed by a steering committee with expert groups on specific business areas.  Officials from my Department attend the meetings of the steering committee.  In addition, the IBF and IMSA are represented on the euro changeover group which was set up by my Department in 1996 to advise on technical issues in the run-up to the 1998 decision on which member states qualify for EMU and to help co-ordination of the changeover across the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters facing the banking sector include the future of the State banks.  In relation to ACC and ICC, the Government authorised me to enter into consultations with the boards, management and staff of these banks, with a view to developing detailed proposals on the future structure and ownership of the banks, in a way which would recognise the interests of all stakeholders, including the taxpayer.  I am currently awaiting formal submissions from the staff unions in both banks.  In relation to the TSB, only the trustees can initiate a change in the status of the bank and <Col N="134" /> I have no formal proposal from them in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the issue surrounding the current investigations into the activities of certain institutions.  In this regard, the Moriarty tribunal is currently investigating matters, including banking issues, related to payments to Messrs. Haughey and Lowry.  Also, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank are currently undertaking their own investigations into certain, recently reported, activities of National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>As is clear, all of these issues are being addressed by the appropriate fora.  In the circumstances, I do not have any plans at present to establish a separate commission.</P>

      <P>Profits earned by banks are liable to corporation tax at the standard rate, currently 32 per cent with a reduced rate of 25 per cent on the first £50,000 of annual profits.  Profits of the banks which arise <Col N="135" /> from licensed trading operations in the IFSC are subject to a rate of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated corporation tax paid by the four main associated banks in 1997 was £103 million.  This amount does not include the amount of overseas tax paid by the banks in 1997, which could be significant.  The additional tax paid by subsidiary companies is not included in the figure shown.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that on the basis of 1995-96 statistics, the latest available, the tax liability for that year of identifiable subsidiaries was of the order of £22 million.</P>
      <P>The latest information available in relation to the profits of these banks is in respect of accounting periods falling between 1 April 1995 and 31 March 1996.  The corporation tax liability of these banks for that period, including the tax payable on foreign and IFSC profits, as a proportion of their total income before allowances and deductions, is estimated at 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The tax position of the banks and other financial institutions is kept under continuous review and action can be taken if need be to secure the revenues to the State from this important sector.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989, as amended, are set down in regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.  Where the person meets the medical criteria, the local director of community care and medical officer of health issues a primary medical certificate for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the issue of a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent board, whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The current list of medical criteria was drawn up following wide ranging consultation with all interested parties, including organisations representing the disabled.  The scope of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in the course of the review, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many additional categories of disabled people.  I should emphasise that the scheme is targeted at those people who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which administers the scheme, that complaints have been received from medical officers responsible for the issue of the primary medical certificates, that they are being pressurised to issue certificates to persons who are not meeting the qualifying medical criteria.  It is understood that persons who have been refused certificates have complained that others, who are no longer disabled, continue to benefit from tax relief despite the improvement in their condition. While I have no plans to carry out a wide ranging review, the aforementioned aspect is now being examined as part of a technical review of the <Col N="137" /> scheme.  The question of primary medical certificates being issued, subject to a review clause, at the discretion of the medical officer, and subject to appeal to the medical board of appeal, is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that, in response to parliamentary questions asked by Deputies O'Keeffe and McManus on 19 November 1997, I outlined the position at that time in relation to the examination undertaken by officials in my Department on the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions.  To facilitate this examination they had been in contact with the industry, including representatives of the banks and the building societies.  They reported their findings to my predecessor who decided that, given the potential legal and constitutional issues, the amounts likely to be involved and the administrative and other difficulties associated with establishing an operationally viable system to deal with dormant accounts, further action in the matter at that time would be unlikely to be cost effective from an Exchequer viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe will also recall that, in response to his raising this issue on Second Stage of the Central Bank Bill, 1997, I advised him that that the subject has also interested me for some time and that I was going to let the matter rest.  I also said, however, that it is not an immediate priority for me but that I will investigate this matter further during my term of office.  In the meantime, I am not prepared to release the results of my officials' examinations.</P>

      <P>The most recent CSO data on prices, for January issued in February, shows that for the year ending January 1998, overall prices went up by 1.8 per cent, while the food price element increased by 2.4 per cent &mdash; other categories included clothing and footwear which fell by 9.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware the Government is committed to improving the position of people on low incomes.  My recent budget included increases in short-term social welfare rates for those under 66 years of about 4.5 per cent, while those over 66 years of age received increases of between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent.  Under my budget, there will be an increase in the personal tax allowance of £250-£500, and a reduction in the standard rate of income tax by 2 per cent to 24 per cent.  Weekly employee PRSI allowances are to be increased from £80 to £100 for full PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>I also announced measures which were specifically aimed at those on lower incomes and the unemployed.  These include the introduction of a £3,000 tax allowance in respect of long-term unemployed persons entering the labour market. The number of places under the back-to-work allowance scheme is to increase by 5,000, from 22,000 to 27,000.  The changes in the operation of the family income supplement which I announced will significantly increase the numbers eligible for a weekly payment, while the average payment will also increase from £39 to £50.</P>
      <P>These measures, along with positive action on social inclusion and investment in education and training, will help to improve the position of those on low incomes.  It also demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring all sections of our society benefit from the fruits of our current economic growth.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and I are preparing actively for the decisions to be made at the beginning of May this year, in relation to the adoption of the single currency and the beginning of the third stage of EMU.</P>
      <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of EMU is to be made in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 109j of the Treaty.  The ECOFIN Council will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the EMI.  On the basis of these reports, ECOFIN, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Commission and the EMI will produce their convergence reports on 25 March next, allowing time for the Council and the European Parliament to examine them in detail before their formal decisions.  The Commission will make its recommendations on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that my Department has transmitted to the European Commission a return under Council Regulation EC/3605/93, in relation to the general government budgetary position and the general government debt.  This return showed that Ireland has continued its successful <Col N="140" /> performance against the relevant Maastricht convergence criteria.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has continued to be kept informed of developments in recent months. EMU was the subject of statements in the Seanad on 16 October 1997, where I addressed the House at length.  EMU was also the subject of consideration by joint Oireachtas committees: I addressed a joint meeting of the Joint Committees on Enterprise and Small Business and on Finance and the Public Service on 4 February this year. The Government would be anxious to facilitiate a Dáil discussion of the convergence reports, to be published by the Commission and the EMI, before the Easter recess.  Of course, the provisions relating to economic and monetary union in the Maastricht Treaty have already been ratified by the Oireachtas and endorsed by referendum.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Bill, 1997, which will bring the legislation governing the Central Bank of Ireland into conformity with the relevant Treaty provisions on EMU, is proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted before the end of March.  My Department is also preparing an Economic and Monetary Union Bill which, when enacted, will ensure a clear and comprehensive framework in Irish monetary law following the introduction of the euro and will remove incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the EU regulations for the use of the euro.</P>
    <P>9 As regards practical preparations, my Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.  On 14 January, I published the second edition of the national changeover plan, which sets out the changeover arrangements that will be made by the public sector and financial institutions.  The business awareness campaign run by Forfás, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will be extended in 1998.</P>
    <P>Assuming it is confirmed that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for entering EMU, a currency changeover board will be established under the aegis of my Department to oversee detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.</P>
    <P>At European level, the UK Presidency has included preparations for the third stage of EMU as an item on all ECOFIN meetings since the beginning of the year, and has stated that it will continue to do so for the duration of its Presidency.  Preparations are also ongoing at the monetary committee, on which my Department and the Central Bnak of Ireland are represented.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that my Department and I will continue with all necessary preparations for the May weekend, both here in Ireland and in the EU fora.</P>

      <P>Delivering Better Government, the 1996 report of the group of secretaries co-ordinating the introduction of the strategic management initiative, recommended that a multi-annual budgeting system be introduced.</P>
      <P>This Government has firmly endorsed the strategic management initiative.  Significant progress has been made with the introduction of the new multi-annual system.</P>
      <P>A multi-annual projection of the major revenue and expenditure aggregates on the assumption of unchanged policies was published with the 1997 budget.  The expenditure data were in aggregate form, without a breakdown by Vote groups.</P>
      <P>I developed the approach further by publishing, as part of the presentation of the medium-term implications of the 1998 budget, projections showing expenditure by individual ministerial Vote groups for the period 1998-2000.  Again, the projections are on the basis of a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; assessment of the final 1998 expenditure allocations decided by the Government.</P>
      <P>In my 1998 budget speech, I said that I will be considering, in preparing for the 1999 budget, the next stage of the move to multi-annual budgeting, as envisaged in Delivering Better Government.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted all Departments and Offices on the issues faced in moving on to the next stage in the 1999 budget, and I intend shortly to examine carefully the results of this consultation process.  I may put the issue to the Government for decision.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on many occasions, I am concerned about the likely impact the abolition of duty free sales could have on our economy.  As an island we are likely to be disproportionately affected and this is one of the reasons independent consultants are conducting a study in this area.

      <Quest>the impact of Government decisions since the December 1997 budget on the estimated net non-capital supply services outlined in his multi-annual budget for 1999; the principal components of any changes, including increases in Appropriations-in-Aid; the estimated savings, if any, on existing services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The figure for net non-capital supply services in 1999 published as part of the multi-annual presentation of the 1998 budget represents the projected cost in 1999 of maintaining the existing level of programmes and services as provided for in the expenditure estimates set out in the 1998 Abridged Estimates Volume adjusted for changes announced in the budget i.e. a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; projection of spending in 1999.</P>
      <P>Since the budget, a number of additional cost pressures have emerged, most of which have arisen due to estimating or technical factors, for example, in the case of certain demand led schemes and programmes.  Where the Government has taken decisions involving additional cost, it has sought, in so far as possible, to meet those costs from within the existing allocations and thereby minimise the impact on the multi-annual no policy change costings published in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional costs which have arisen since the budget have been substantially offset by savings which have emerged, mainly on the Social Welfare Estimate.  The bulk of these savings arise due to an estimated increase in PRSI revenue reflecting the increased tax buoyancy in the economy generally.  The savings are sufficient to offset <Col N="143" /> nearly all of the additional costs which have emerged since the budget and the overall impact on the 1998 non-capital supply services Estimates and the 1999 &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; projections is therefore minimal.</P>
    <P>The details of all the changes since the budget in the 1998 Estimates for non-capital supply services will be included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services which I plan to publish around the middle of March.</P>

      <P>The Government intends to pursue a programme of expenditure reviews.  It supports the initiative on this matter taken by the previous Administration. As was announced last July, the Government is actively pursuing a programme of reviews.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in July 1997 on the first programme of reviews.  The Government decision covered the reviews which were to be started in 1997.  The Government also considered an indicative list of the reviews which might be started in the second and third years of the programme.</P>
      <P>Each review is to be carried out under the aegis of joint Finance and spending Department steering groups.  The lead role in the review will be taken by the spending Department.</P>
      <P>The reviews are now under way according to the schedule decided by the Government.  Steering groups have been established, terms of reference agreed and work on the reviews themselves has begun.  I am confident we will see a substantial number of reviews completed by the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>Until the first round of reviews are finalised, it is not possible to take firm decisions on the reviews which should be carried out in the next stage.  An indicative list of reviews to be undertaken in 1999 has been approved by the Government, but this is provisional.  A Government decision on the next round of reviews will take account of the aim, admittedly ambitious, of reviewing all programmes over a three year period, and of the lessons learned from the first round of reviews.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty has an important role to play in shifting <Col N="144" /> some of the burden of taxation on wage and salary income to property.  The total yield from all stamp duties in 1997 was over £410 million.  The stamp duty yield from the transfer of all land and buildings, including secondhand residential property, for 1997 was £254 million.  Any loss in this revenue from stamp duty would have to be compensated for by either additional taxation in other areas or reductions in Government spending.</P>
      <P>Any proposed changes to stamp duty on real property, in particular, would need to take full account of any possible impact on rising house prices.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has commissioned a study of house price rises, so that all available information in relation to house price trends, the factors influencing house prices and the implications of changing house price levels will be analysed.  The information will then be available to the Government to further develop housing policy.  I would be reluctant to pre-empt the outcome of this study.  Consequently, I do not intend to make any changes to the stamp duty regime on real property at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in reply to an earlier question from Deputy Deenihan, information on the marketing of particular financial products would reside, if at all, with the Central Bank, and, in the case of tax evasion, with the Revenue Commissioners, in so far as such data comes to their attention in the course of their operations.  On 26 January 1998, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank requesting that he clarify the position in so far as it might relate to exchange controls.  I also asked him to report to me separately on the implications, if any, for all aspects of banking supervision.  The Governor responded to me on 28 January to the effect that he is having these issues investigated and will report to me as soon as possible.  To date, I have not received an interim or preliminary report.  As the Deputies are well aware, the examination and pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  This is the position which has applied, and has been accepted in the House, since the foundation of the State.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in individual cases.  I understand, however, that the investigations are proceeding as a matter of priority and I can assure the House on that point.  The question of publishing a report does not arise, therefore, at this time.</P>
      <P>As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I have asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the adequacy of the Revenue Commissioners' powers following the report of the McCracken tribunal.  I have also said that if additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, then proposals to enhance the Revenue Commissioners' powers will be brought forward.  However, before taking such an initiative, it will be necessary to have all the relevant information from the series of inquiries currently under way.  Indeed the Moriarty tribunal is specifically charged with making recommendations in the areas of banking supervision, the protection of the revenues of the State and offshore accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, for the benefit of the House, I would not, if they were shown to be necessary, rule out new provisions, for example, to require financial institutions to report to the Revenue Commissioners where they become aware that financial products sold by them may facilitate tax evasion; or to notify the Revenue Commissioners where funds have been transferred in certain circumstances to or from particular offshore <Col N="146" /> locations.  There might also be new powers to the Revenue Commissioners to access bank accounts where there are reasonable grounds to believe that certain accounts are, or may be used, in a tax evasion scheme.</P>
    <P>Any such proposals would need to be very carefully gone into to ensure that they would be effective, could not be easily circumvented, would not needlessly disrupt the affairs of law-abiding taxpayers and would be proportionate in their effect on the financial sector when measured against the problem to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Any responsible Government would need to have as much information as possible by way of answer to these issues before it acted.  That is why I have taken the approach I have.  Caution and care should not be confused with indifference or indolence in these matters.  The Opposition seems to want to rush in with unspecified and unlimited powers.  I have to take a more responsible approach &mdash; one which, at the end of the day, will better secure the welfare of the ordinary citizen of this State and its revenues.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt about the Government's determination to combat tax evasion and avoidance.  The 1998 Finance Bill contains a number of new provisions for this purpose and I have made further announcements at the weekend to clamp down on new avoidance schemes.  I will not hesitate to take further action as the need arises whether as regards increasing the powers of the Revenue Commissioners or implementing other measures that are likely to be effective.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement I made in the House on 26 February 1998 in which I indicated that my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been directed, as a matter of urgency, to continue working on this issue with a view to coming up with an effective set of measures under company and tax legislation which will curb the misuse of Irish registered non-resident companies.  Once this work is complete, it is intended to publish draft proposals to deal with this problem and seek comments from the regulatory and development agencies as well as other interested parties.  Following this, <Col N="147" /> the matter will be brought to the Government for decision on what measures will be introduced.</P>
      <P>On the question of representations from tax authorities in other countries, I am informed that concerns about the operation of Irish registered non-resident companies have been raised with the Revenue Commissioners by certain countries, such as the Baltic States, in the context of double tax treaty negotiations, and also informally at OECD and certain other international fora.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they have received about 20 queries under the VAT programme of mutual assistance seeking verification of specific invoices relating to Irish registered non-resident companies.  In relation to direct taxes, while the Revenue Commissioners have received a number of general requests for information on Irish registered non-resident companies from other tax authorities, no specific allegations or complaints have been received about individual companies.  In addition, under customs mutual assistance programmes, they have received 14 specific inquiries about such companies.  I am precluded, however, from giving further details of these cases as this might prejudice ongoing investigations in the countries concerned.  An estimated 50 further inquiries of a general nature have been received by the customs authorities in relation to Irish registered non-resident companies.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the black economy monitoring group, to which the Deputy is presumably referring, was set up initially under the Programme for National Recovery.  It has been continued in subsequent national agreements, including Partnership 2000. Paragraph 3.22 of Partnership 2000 defines the role of the group as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government are aware of, and will take further measures as appropriate to counter tax and social welfare fraud.  The Black Economy Monitoring Group, which is drawn from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare, the CIF, IBEC and ICTU, will continue its work of monitoring developments and reviewing the effectiveness of measures taken to combat tax and social welfare fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group continues to meet regularly, approximately every two months, to monitor developments and to review the effectiveness of measures taken to combat tax and social welfare fraud.  The membership of the group has been extended to include the Small Firms Association, <Col N="148" /> so that the particular concerns of the small business sector can be included in the group's deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs respond to the concerns raised in the group by carrying out investigations of the matters raised and, where there is evidence of black economy activity, taking appropriate action.  Where necessary, the question of amending the tax or social welfare code would also be considered.  Also, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs keep members of the group informed of new initiatives to tackle the black economy.</P>
    <P>The group has proved to be a useful forum for exchange of information on black economy activity.  Tangible results have been achieved in relation to the construction industry where the group made recommendations, since implemented, on the tightening up of the sub-contractor system.  At present it is discussing the concerns raised by IBEC and the SFA about social welfare fraud and the difficulties being experienced by employers in enticing persons in receipt of social welfare benefits to take up employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to respond to the questions raised and to update the House on developments in freedom of information.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act, FOI, as Deputies probably know, will commence on 21 April next.  The Act confers new rights on members of the public, namely, the right to access information held by Government bodies, the right to receive reasons for decisions and the right to seek correction of personal information, whether held in manual or electronic form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe all of us are agreed this is a welcome development and long overdue.  Freedom of Information is, part of a wide package of far reaching reforms in public administration under the Delivering Better Government programme. The Public Service Management Act and the quality customer service initiative are also key features of the reform programme.  Taken together, these initiatives will enhance accountability and place the citizen at the centre of our thinking and practice in the design and delivery of public services. <Col N="149" /> Deputy Bell asked specifically about circular 15/79 &mdash;&ldquo;Official Secrecy and Integrity&rdquo;&mdash; which deals, <i>inter alia,</i> with the obligations imposed on civil servants by the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  I am happy to confirm that I intend to rescind this circular and to replace it with a new Civil Service code.  This code, which will take full account of recent legislative changes is currently at an advanced stage of preparation.  It will set out guidance on the principal precepts which govern the work of civil servants, including the disclosure of official information.  It is intended that circular 15/79 should be rescinded before 21 April next.</P>
    <P>As regards the names of officers nominated to oversee implementation in each Department and relevant body, I take it the Deputy is referring to those bodies coming within the scope of the Act from commencement on 21 April next.  I am happy to provide these details in the list.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the implementation of Freedom of Information, I take this opportunity to advise as to the preparations under way.  In conjunction with an interdepartmental working group, an freedom of information central policy unit in my Department directs and co-ordinates preparations across public bodies.</P>
    <P>Preparations for implementation are basically being undertaken across four main areas: training, publications, organisational arrangements and record management.</P>
    <P>Extensive training is essential, both to familiarise officials so that they can effectively deal with freedom of information requests and also to foster the profound cultural change required.  Training commenced last September and, to date, over 2,000 staff have received training on freedom of information.  This major programme of freedom of information is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Under the Act, public bodies are obliged to produce manuals which set out their general structure and organisation, arrangements in place for accessing information and details of the procedures, practices and guidelines used in dealing with the public.  Preparations on these publications are well advanced and will be completed by commencement day.</P>
    <P>Each Department has appointed an officer at Assistant Secretary level to oversee the implementation process in their respective Departments.  Organisational preparations include: identifying decision makers and delegating appropriate freedom of information functions to such officers, determining how freedom of information requests will be processed, prioritising local freedom of information training and putting <Col N="150" /> in place procedures for internal review of freedom of information decisions which are appealed by members of the public.</P>
    <P>The Act obliges public bodies to provide access to information they hold.  However, the advent of technology has led to significant disimprovement in record management practices over recent years.  Departments are undertaking urgent action so as to tackle this fundamental problem. They are being assisted by a centrally based record management group which provide ongoing advice and support.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act, will, of course protect key sensitive information in the interest of the wider community.  So, for example, material relating to sensitive law enforcement matters or subject to legal professional privilege will enjoy protection under the Act.  Such exemptions to the right of access are in line with best international practice abroad.  However, I should point out that most of the exemptions are not absolute.  Many allow information to be released where the balance of the public interest lies in disclosure.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real strength of freedom of information is that ultimate decisions on routinely withholding information from the public do not rest with the Department or public body. Instead such decisions will be decided by an independent Information Commissioner.  Experience abroad has shown time and again that the key to successful implementation of freedom of information is a strong independent watchdog to ensure against misuse of exemptions.  Recognising this, the Act establishes a new Office of Information Commissioner who will have wide ranging powers to investigate the withholding of information and to issue binding decisions.</P>
    <P>The advent of freedom of information presents opportunities but poses significant challenges for those of us in public life and in public service. None of us can expect that the culture of secrecy which has been embedded in our administrative systems for generations will just disappear over-night.  As with jurisdictions abroad, it will be an evolving process.  However, let me, as Minister with special responsibility for freedom of information, reassure the House the Government will not spare itself in ensuring this change comes about.  Based on the real progress made to date by Departments and public bodies in their preparations for freedom of information, I look forward to a more open and accountable public service which thrives through enhancing the confidence of the public which it serves.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my responsibility in the matter is confined to the Civil Service.  While the Civil Service Commissioners give credit at their competitions to candidates who are proficient in both Irish and English, a knowledge of the Irish language is not in fact an obligatory requirement for appointment to the Civil Service except where the use of Irish is essential for carrying out the <Col N="153" /> duties of the position.  Such a requirement might, for instance, apply to certain positions in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or in the Department of Education and Science.  Otherwise, applicants who fulfil the requirements for a competition will normally be eligible to compete even if they lack proficiency in Irish and do not have a knowledge of another European language.</P>

      <P>Performance related pay systems are currently in place in two areas of the public service.  In the Civil Service, a bonus scheme applies to assistant secretaries and some departmental and professional post-holders at that level.  A bonus scheme is also a feature of the remuneration of some senior managers and chief executives in a number of non-commercial State bodies.  The introduction of these schemes followed from the recommendations in report No. 35 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
      <P>The review body has made further recommendations on performance related pay in report No. 37, which was published in March 1997.  The report recommends an enhancement of the bonus scheme for assistant secretaries and that the feasibility of extending bonus arrangements to other grades at assistant secretary and deputy secretary levels in the Civil Service be examined.  The report also recommends the introduction of performance related pay schemes for local authority managers and assistant managers, and for health board chief executives, and further extension of bonus arrangements in the non-commercial State body area.</P>
      <P>No decision has been taken by the Government in relation to implementation of the recommendations contained in report No. 37.  The question of implementation is, however, being kept under review by the Government.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that, as part of the strategic management initiative, a system of performance management is currently being designed and developed in order to underpin the achievement of objectives set out in the day-to-day work programmes for staff at all levels in each Department and, thereby, to promote a high performance, results-oriented Civil Service.  Issues relating to recognition of, and reward for, good performance, including performance related pay, will arise for consideration as a corollary to the introduction of a performance management system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's preparations for the move to stage three of EMU are in accordance with the timetable set out in the Maastricht Treaty, which is as follows.  The Council of Economic and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency, on the basis of a recommendation from the European Commission and convergence reports from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the forerunner of the European Central Bank.  ECOFIN will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government of the EU member states, who will, after consulting the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions for adopting the euro.</P>
      <P>The EMI and Commission reports and the Commission recommendation will be published on 25 March 1998.  The European Parliament will be consulted following their publication.  ECOFIN will meet to make its assessment on 1 May 1998, with Parliament's formal opinion on 2 May, and the final decision by the Heads of State or Government on the afternoon of 2 May.</P>
      <P>As regards national preparations for EMU, clearly the first requirement is that Ireland meets the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty for membership of EMU, and the Deputy will be aware that Ireland does in fact meet them. Indeed, as regards the budgetary criteria, my Department published figures last Friday which show that Ireland achieved a General Government budgetary surplus of 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1997, compared with an original 1997 budget projection of a deficit of 1.5 per cent.  They also show that the ratio of the General Government Debt to GDP fell to 66.3 per cent at the end of 1997 from 72.7 per cent a year earlier.  In relation to 1998, a surplus of 0.5 per cent is projected, while the debt ratio is forecast to fall to about 61 per cent by the end of the year.  These figures confirm that Ireland complies with the budgetary criteria for qualification for membership of EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the legislation front, the Central Bank Bill, 1997, is making its way through the Oireachtas at present.  This Bill is designed to provide for the compatibility of Ireland's Central Bank legislation with the requirements in the Maastricht Treaty for independence of national central banks and for national legislation, including central bank statutes, to be compatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the European System <Col N="155" /> of Central Banks.  Changes to taxation law required for the introduction of the euro are included in the Finance Bill, 1998, which was published on 12 February.  It is intended to have legislation enacted before the summer to provide for other changes in national law made necessary by the introduction of the euro and work on that legislation is proceeding at present.</P>
    <P>As regards practical preparations, my Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.</P>
    <P>On 14 January I published the second edition of EMU and the euro: Ireland's National Changeover Plan.  The plan is based on the assumption that EMU will begin on time and that Ireland will be a member of it from the outset.  It also outlines the timetable for the changeover to the euro.  On 1 January 1999, EMU will begin and the euro will come into being as the currency of the participating member states.  It will be useable for cashless transactions, e.g. cheques and credit transfers, from that date.  However, euro notes and coins will not be available for a further three years, so Irish pound notes and coins will continue in use and all banking facilities currently available in Irish pounds will continue to be available; in other words, individuals will be able to operate in Irish pounds as they do at present.  On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and by 1 July 2002 at the latest &mdash; probably a good deal earlier &mdash; Irish pound notes and coins will cease to be legal tender and the changeover to the euro will be complete.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out the changeover arrangements that will be made by the public sector &mdash; including, specifically, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my own Department &mdash; the banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange.  It also outlines the initiatives which have been put in place by my Department in connection with the changeover.  In 1995, a Single Currency Officers Team, was set up.  This includes a representative from each Department and its remit is to co-ordinate preparations for the changeover to the euro in the public sector; in 1996 the euro changeover group was set up. This includes representatives from ICTU, IBEC and a wide range of private sector bodies and its remit is to help co-ordinate the changeover across the economy, in 1997 the euro changeover team in my Department was set up, to carry out my Department's tasks in relation to the changeover in the public administration and in the rest of the economy and in 1996 the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign was established to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for the changeover.</P>
    <P>An appendix to the plan outlines the changeover work being done by various public and private sector bodies and lists contact points for <Col N="156" /> further information.  A copy of the plan was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and further copies are available from my Department and from Forfás, including on the Internet.</P>
    <P>As regards preparation by business, Forfás has been running a very successful EMU business awareness campaign.  The campaign has produced an excellent information pack for business of which over 30,000 copies have been circulated. The campaign has recently run a radio advertising campaign and has also circulated a summary leaflet in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners: over 140,000 copies of the leaflet have been distributed.  Over 60,000 copies of a leaflet designed for SMEs have also been distributed. Forfás will continue its activities for 1998 and plans to issue further documents on issues such as information technology and a guide for retailers.</P>
    <P>As regards further initiatives in 1998, the national changeover plan makes it clear that the focus of the information programme on the changeover will be broadened to include an information programme for the general public on the changeover to the euro which will run throughout 1998 and beyond.  This programme will be co-ordinated by my Department in conjunction with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Assuming the European Council confirms in May that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro, a currency changeover board will be established to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.</P>

      <P>On budget day the Department of Finance forecast an increase of 7.1 per cent tax receipts for 1998. This was based on an estimated outturn for 1997 of £14,158 million inclusive of £100 million motor vehicle duties which is now retained by the local authorities.  The actual outturn for 1997 was £14,272, some £124 million better than expected on budget day, 3 December.  To reflect this higher outturn, it is now forecast that receipts will be £15,270 million in 1998 compared with the budget day forecast of £15,167 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cumulative tax receipts up to the end of February are about 9 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year but these do not as yet reflect the impact of most of the budget day changes.  At this stage it is not our intention to revise our forecasts on foot of data for the year to-date.  As usual, I will be issuing a detailed statement <Col N="157" /> on the Exchequer returns at the end of the quarter.</P>

      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Finance Ministers of the European Union on 16 February last consisted of the following issues.</P>
      <P>Preparation for the broad economic policy guidelines &mdash; The Council had a general discussion on key economic issues with a view to giving guidance to the Commission on the questions Ministers wish to have addressed in the broad policy guidelines 1998-99.  The debate was based on an assessment of the economic situation and outlook in the Community carried out by the Commission and by the economic policy and monetary committees.  There was general agreement on the need for continued vigilance in relation to events in Asia.  As regards the Community's economic situation, the need to maintain sound public finances, control inflation and further reduce budget deficits was acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the third stage of EMU &mdash; Council was advised that the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer would, in his capacity as President of Council, attend the forthcoming EMI Council meeting on 3 March.  Member states were also reminded of the importance of early and timely measures to ensure national central bank legislation would be compatible with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.</P>
      <P>VAT on labour intensive services &mdash; The Council held an orientation debate on the Commission's suggestion that member states would be authorised to apply, on a trial basis and for a limited period, a reduced rate of VAT to certain low-skilled labour intensive services supplied locally, e.g. repair services, cleaning, laundries, domestic care services.  The debate was a follow-up to the decision by the Employment European Council of last November that member states should consider this matter.  It was agreed that various technical questions be examined further at official level.  On the basis of that examination, the Council would decide on whether to request the Commission to table a formal proposal in this area to amend the Sixth VAT Directive.</P>
      <P>EIB lending to Bosnia-Herzegovina &mdash; The Council took note of a German request that the possibility of extending the EIB's lending activities to Bosnia-Herzegovina be examined in the light of recent developments in the region.  The issue is expected to be raised again at the ECOFIN meeting on 9 March when the Council expects to hear further from the Commission on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to formal agenda items, Ministers had an informal exchange of views, over lunch, with Mr. Camdessus, managing director of the <Col N="158" /> IMF, on the financial crisis in Asia, its background and possible lessons to be drawn from it regarding the restructuring of the international financial system.  Discussions covered, <i>inter alia,</i> the need for a reform of banking supervision in certain regions as well as for a code of good conduct ensuring transparency and openness on economic and financial policies, the role of the private sector and the need to take into account social consequences.</P>

      <P>The Public Management Act, 1997, was commenced by my order on 1 September 1997.  Following this, a series of steps was taken to provide for the implementation of the Act across the Civil Service, including the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>My Department, in consultation with implementation group of Secretaries General set up by the Taoiseach in July last year to progress the implementation of the strategic management initiative, drafted directions for Departments on the preparation of strategy statements as provided for in section 5 of the Act, and the accountability of Secretaries General to Ministers, as provided for in section 6.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department assisted in the preparation of guidelines by the implementation group to support management in all Departments and scheduled offices in implementing the Act. Specific proposals on these matters were approved by the Government in November 1997 and the directions and implementation group guidelines were issued before Christmas.  I would be happy to make copies of these documents available to the House if the Deputy wishes.</P>
      <P>The Government has also approved proposals in relation to the framework of assignment of authority, responsibility and accountability in Departments and Offices under the Act.  These are currently the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of Civil Service trade unions and staff associations.</P>
      <P>With regard to my own Department, the process of finalising the statement of strategy is well under way.  The Secretary General has submitted his statement of strategy for my approval and I am now considering it.  I will lay copies of this strategy statement before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with the Act by 1 May.</P>

      <P>A new urban renewal scheme will come into operation on 1 August 1998.  Details of the tax incentives have been circulated in the context of a Committee Stage amendment which I will introduce to the Finance Bill.  The amendment provides that, on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Minister for Finance may, by order, designate certain areas for the purpose of one or more of the tax incentives contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The designation of areas for urban renewal purposes will be based on integrated area plans to be prepared for priority areas identified by the relevant local authorities.  These integrated area plans will then be assessed by an expert advisory panel established by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy.  This panel will then make recommendations to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to the designation of areas.</P>

      <P>Unearned income is normally defined as income from non-employment sources.  The main forms of unearned income are rental income, dividend income and interest income.  Rental income will be taxed from 6 April next, at either 24 or 46 per cent, the same as earned income.  Dividend income is normally taxable at these rates.  Deposit interest income will normally be taxable at 24 per cent from 6 April next except for deposit interest income from special savings accounts which will be taxable at 20 per cent.  Other interest income e.g. from Government securities, will normally be chargeable to income tax at either 24 per cent or 46 per cent.  Capital gains are being taxed at 20 per cent, except for development land which remains at 40 per cent.  I hope that this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Following my meeting with representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, it was agreed to continue the corporation tax exemption for the surplus income of credit unions, to drop the proposal in the Finance Bill to apply DIRT to deposits, to drop the proposed requirement for the reporting of dividends of credit unions where these exceed £500 per annum, and to remove the existing reporting requirement in relation to deposit interest over £500 per annum.  These measures will require amendments to the Finance Bill.  I will accordingly introduce such appropriate amendments when the Bill is on Committee Stage later this week.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that a working group will be set up with the league under an independent chairperson to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings, bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, its contribution to society and the wider taxation issues involved.  The working group will report its findings to me by 30 September 1998.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently undertaking consultations with the Irish League of Credit Unions regarding the composition of the working group and a suitable chairperson.  I am satisfied these proposals will offer a reasonable basis for addressing the issue of credit unions taxation.</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that the gain made on the sale of an individual's principal private residence does not give rise to capital gains tax.  The reduction in the rate of capital gains tax will, therefore, apply only to the sale of investment property.  While it may affect the demand for such property, the reduction will, in my view, also have a positive effect on the number of disposals taking place. Consequently, I would expect to see a greater number of housing units, which were being held as investment properties, coming on to the property market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it should be borne in mind that profits earned from dealing in property as a trade, as distinct from disposing of assets, are liable to income tax or corporation tax rather than capital gains tax.  In such situations the reduction in the <Col N="161" /> standard rate of capital gains tax will have no impact.</P>

      <P>Under section 10 of the 1985 Finance Act (section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997), there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years.  The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees.  In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives.  A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife.  A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent.  The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure, without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale.  For all these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons whether for the purposes of the early retirement scheme or generally.</P>

      <P>In my budget speech, I stated that for a considerable period of time I have held the view that a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax would release pent up investment funds and create an incentive for the acquisition of further capital assets.  I believe that the low standard rate of capital gains tax, which I introduced on budget day, will encourage further investment and growth in the economy in the future.  I base this view on what I have seen in my own experience as an accountant.</P>
      <P>I am not alone in this view.  The Institute of Taxation, in its pre-budget submission, called for a sizeable reduction in the rate of capital gains tax.  Forfás, the Irish Stock Exchange and IBEC also called for a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax on some or most investments.  The rationale for a cut in the rate of capital gains tax given by all of these bodies was that there would, among other things, be an increase in the level of disposals being made.</P>
      <P>Because death is not a disposal for the purposes of incurring a capital gains tax charge, assets can be passed on to the next generation, with their value being re-based to the date of death and no capital gains tax payable on the pre-death gains.  Since the low rate of capital gains tax will encourage people to dispose of assets, this will mean that those who would have otherwise avoided the charge to capital gains tax altogether, by holding on to their assets until death, may now be encouraged to pay capital gains tax at the low standard rate of 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Under the Structural Fund regulations 1994-99, Ireland qualifies for Objective 1 status as a single region under the European System of Regional Classification by virtue of the fact that <i>per capita</i> GDP for the entire country for the three years 1988, 1989, 1990 was less than 75 per cent of the European Union average.

    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> In Agenda 2000, the European Commission has proposed transitional arrangements for regions like Ireland which are currently eligible for Objective 1 status but which will have passed the eligibility criteria.  Negotiations on the substance of the arrangements for Structural Funds in the next round are still very much at a preliminary stage.  These negotiations are likely to persist right through this year and, almost certainly, into next year.</P>
    <P>The negotiations in question will involve agreement with the European Commission and the Council of a satisfactory transitional regime to cover the situation in which Ireland as a whole can no longer expect to qualify as an Objective 1 region on the basis of having a <i>per capita</i> GDP below 75 per cent of the Community average.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increase in GDP, it is the Government's position that transition arrangements must ensure continued and generous access to the Objective 1 funding envelope during the next programming period, so as to meet the substantial backlogs in infrastructural and social development which continue to persist in Ireland and which are even, to a degree, accentuated by our recent economic success.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Government is especially conscious of the needs of the less-developed parts of the country and those suffering from population decline and will do all in its power to ensure the needs of these areas are properly addressed, as promised in the Government's Programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium.  The Government has welcomed the conclusions and recommendations made in the National Economic and Social Council's (NESC) report No. 102 entitled <i>Population Distribution and Economic Development: Trends and Policy implications.</i>  Its comprehensive nature makes it a further key input to the formulation of policy and has been referred to relevant Ministers and Departments for their consideration in that context.</P>

    <P>I am informed that both individuals acted as special projects managers.  Their role was to advise the Taoiseach and, through the Taoiseach, the Government in relation to development proposals which offered possibilities of increased employment.  The role of the special projects <Col N="165" /> manager was, essentially, one of co-ordinating the work of Departments and State bodies involved in such projects to ensure progress was made on bringing them to the decision stage by the appropriate authority.  This work arose out of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which had a big commitment to advancing projects in various sectors so as to increase employment.</P>
    <P>The investment based scheme of naturalisation is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and not my Department.  While I am informed that the special projects manager at this Department did not have a specific role in the operation of the scheme, they did play a part, in certain cases, in facilitating contacts.  Messrs.  Regan and Donnelly have stated they had no involvement in the scheme prior to 1990 and any involvement after that date was minimal.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be founded on an incorrect premise.  Of the 40,000 places on the community employment programme approximately 10,000, or some 25 per cent are reserved for persons aged 35 or over who have been unemployed for three years or more or who fulfil the age requirement and are in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments.  This component of CE is known as the part-time jobs option.  The balance of places are for persons over 21 years of age who have been unemployed for one year or more or who fulfil the age requirement and are in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments.  The number of places under the part-time jobs option was increased by 1,000 in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>FÁS does not report a particular problem for rural sponsors in filling places under either of these options.  Where a sponsor identifies to FÁS such a problem at local level, FÁS will work closely with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to identify a suitable candidate for placement on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme was remodelled in 1996 into its current configuration specifically in order to be more targeted on the long-term unemployed.  There are no plans to change this emphasis.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, referred to by the Deputy, sets out statutory rights for employees in respect of rest, maximum working time and holidays.  In relation to working time it provides, generally, for a maximum working week of 48 hours &mdash; in the interests of safety, health and welfare of workers.</P>
      <P>The question of compensation, if any, for workers in respect of loss of income suffered as a result of reduced overtime earnings is a matter for negotiation between employers and workers and/or their respective representatives.</P>
      <P>The 48 hour working week came into effect, generally, on 1 March 1998.  However, in order to provide time for adjustment for those working long hours at present, the Act contains transitional provisions.  These provide that employees may work up to 60 hours per week from 1 March 1998 to 28 February 1999, and up to 55 hours per week from 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2000. The 48 hour week comes into effect in respect of all employees covered by the Act on 1 March 2000.  To work the maximum permitted hours during 1998 and 1999 an agreement must be reached between the parties which is approved by the Labour Court.  The Fifth Schedule to the Act details the procedures to be observed in implementing the transitional provisions.</P>

      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court can only investigate an industrial dispute if the employees involved are covered by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the dispute is a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; as defined in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  On the basis of legal advice available to my Department, a person whose contract of employment has been terminated by retirement is no longer a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Industrial Relations Acts. Furthermore, a dispute concerning pension arrangements is only considered to be a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo;, within the meaning of the 1946 Act, while a person is still employed; it ceases to be such when the person retires.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, as amended, contains provisions for the proper administration of occupational pension schemes and the protection of the rights of members of such schemes.  If a member of a scheme is concerned that the trustees of that scheme have not complied with a provision of the Pensions Act, he or she may complain to the Pensions Board.  The board has extensive powers of investigation and other powers under the Act.  The Act provides for penalties where a person is found not to have carried out his/her duties under the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has asked the Pensions Board, during its current term of office, to report to him on the issue of a pensions ombudsman.  The matter will be considered by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in due course, in the light of that report.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider it would be appropriate to amend the Industrial Relations Acts to give pensioners general access to the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in relation to pension grievances.</P>

      <P>My recent official visit to the People's Republic <Col N="170" /> of China from 24-28 February enabled me to confirm that while human rights in China continue to be unsatisfactory in many ways, developments which have taken place over the year have given rise to hopes for improvement.  Among the positive steps which have been taken by the Chinese authorities in recent months are: the EU-China human rights dialogue was resumed last October and a package of practical measures to assist the development of human rights in China is being put together in this context; China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights last October; the prominent political dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was released from prison last November; the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has been formally invited to visit China and China has recently granted unprecedented access to the UN working group on Arbitrary Detention.</P>
      <P>China has also agreed to the holding of the first EU-China summit which will take place in London on 2 April next, and I understand that human rights will be a significant issue at that meeting.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit to China, I raised the issue of human rights both with Prime Minister Li Peng and Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  I also took up the question of human rights in Hong Kong in my meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr. Tung Chee-hwa.</P>

      <P>With regard to the alleged removal of body organs from executed prisoners for use in transplant surgery, I understand that Chinese officials claim that consent for such removal of organs is required in advance from the prisoners who are about to be executed or from their next of kin.  It does not appear to be possible for human rights organisations to determine whether such consent is given.  With regard to the reported sale of body organs from China in foreign countries, including the United States, I am very concerned at these reports and I am making appropriate inquiries to determine their veracity.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners consider human rights reform in Kenya to be essential alongside broader constitutional reforms in that country, particularly following the outcome of the national elections held there on 29 December last.  We are, therefore, actively engaged in efforts aimed at ensuring that the country can undergo <Col N="171" /> meaningful democratic transition with full regard for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Along with our European partners, the Government has strongly stated our position on the creation of such an open political climate at last April's 53rd Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and at the 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September.  The EU's concerns are also being pursued directly with the Kenyan authorities by resident EU Ambassadors and their colleagues from countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan, who are members of the international Donors Democratic Development Group in Nairobi.  Since last April, the Government has granted a total of £91,520 to NGO projects supporting human rights and voter education programmes at local level in Kenya.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the legislative reform package introduced in November following negotiations by the Kenyan Inter-Party Parliamentary Group, the EU has, in its Declaration of 6 January 1998, recognised that it was not introduced with adequate time to take full effect before the December elections.  Despite obvious short-comings in the conduct of the elections, it is the hope of the Union that they can yet prove to have been a further step towards greater democracy. We, therefore, wish to see the measures agreed by the interparliamentary group and the process of constitutional review implemented fully in a genuinely inclusive, consultative and open manner.  We consider such an approach essential to achieve the broadest possible consensus on the country's future political institutions.  We also consider that effective action should be taken by the Kenyan authorities both to prevent human rights violations and to bring those responsible for them to justice.</P>
      <P>The Government and our European partners will continue to press for the realisation of full human rights observance and full transition to democratic government in Kenya including at this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that elevated levels of caesium-137 have been detected in feral pigeons living in the Sea-scale area close to Sellafield.  Feral pigeons are highly territorial and are unlikely, therefore, to migrate any great distance.  In addition, this type of pigeon is not normally consumed by the public.</P>
      <P>Both my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) have been in contact with the British authorities concerning this matter.  Information has been provided on the progress of investigations and contact will continue as necessary.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the RPII have analysed a number of samples of wood pigeon, the type normally consumed by the Irish public, and the results indicate that the levels of caesium-137 are below the levels of detection.</P>

      <P>The question of the safety to health of mobile phones to their users has been addressed by many Governments and health advisory authorities around the world.  One of the most recent investigations of this matter was a study by an expert group appointed by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>On 20 November 1996 this expert group reported &ldquo;there is no evidence of any health risk emerging from mobile phones, but the results of present research are inadequate to draw firm conclusions on this issue.  Further research is therefore required&rdquo;.  The expert group in its report made various detailed research recommendations which the Commission has proposed be fed into the fifth framework programme for research and technological development 1998-2002.</P>

    <P>On the basis of this and other studies, together with the application of international practice in Ireland regarding standards for mobile phones, I <Col N="175" /> am satisfied that human and animal health is being protected by the legal framework now in place.

      <Quest>her views on the press statement by a company (details supplied), in view of the fact that a study on a short-wave transmitter concluded interference with sleep down to two nano watts per square centimetre, 100,000 times below the international limit and 76 times above the self professed operation level of the transmitters of this company.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortwave transmitter referred to by the Deputy is the Short Wave Schwarzenburg Transmitter in Switzerland which is operated by Swiss Radio and which has been transmitting overseas to a worldwide audience since 1939, when the Swiss Government decided it was necessary that there be at least one source of objective information broadcasting from continental Europe at that time.  It is a powerful transmitter with three 6.1-21.8 MHz antennaes each <Col N="176" /> with a power of 150,000 watts.  In 1971 an additional 250,000 watt antennae was added.</P>
      <P>Health complaints from local residents led in October 1990 to the Federal Department of Transport and Energy setting up a study group under the direction of Dr. Abelin of the University of Berne.  The study group reported in August 1995.  They found no evidence of any increase in disease among the exposed population.  Neither did the transmitter affect the normal production of night-time melatonin.  A reduction in the production of this hormone by the pineal gland has been associated with increased cancer in animal tests.  The main observation of the study group was of more sleep disorders among the exposed population compared to an unexposed control group.</P>
      <P>In discussing these results the study group noted that the insomnia was self-reported &mdash; residents maintained a diary &mdash; and commented that &ldquo;self-reporting of sleep disorders is not very reliable&rdquo;.  They further commented that the effect of electromagnetic fields &ldquo;if really present is not very strong&rdquo;.  The statistic supporting the association of sleep disorder with electromagnetic fields from the transmitter was only very marginally positive, odds ratio 1.04 to 1.23.</P>
      <P>The power output of a mobile phone mast is around 30 watts and is vastly less than the 700,000 watt output of the short-wave transmitter in question.  In the context of the press statement to which the Deputy refers it is understood that the statement relates to a recent publication by four well known Irish scientists on the subject of phone masts.  There is no technical, medical or scientific basis at this time to dispute their conclusions, although further research is continuing and this Government is supporting that research through participation in the WHO International Electromagnetic Field project.</P>

      <P>The ESB is a commercial State company and as such behaves in accordance with commercial principles in relation to all its investment decisions.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the matter. Moreover, decisions on the siting of transmission lines and infrastructural development are primarily matters for the board and management of ESB, in which I have no direct function. However, in relation to the Cork reinforcement transmission project, the ESB has assured me that following wide consultation, the route of minimum environmental impact was chosen and mitigation measures will be applied where feasible. <Col N="177" /> This proposal was subjected to the full requirements of the planning process and has received the necessary planning approvals.</P>

      <P>Payments under REPS for farmers in natural heritage areas have been made on an ongoing basis since the scheme's inception in June 1994.  In relation to special areas of conservation, a package of measures to compensate farmers with designated lands in such areas was agreed with the farm bodies in February of last year, subject to the approval of the European Commission.  Compensation will be paid either through an improved REPS package, or through a national scheme administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Proposals on the revised REPS measures have been under negotiations with the European Commission.  I am anxious to bring these negotiations <Col N="178" /> to a speedy conclusion and I am hopeful that agreement will be reached shortly.</P>

      <P>An advance payment of £673.10 issued to the person concerned on 5 December 1997 in respect of a suckler cow premium payment. Before the balance of the premium payment can issue all of the forage area declared by the person concerned must be validated by the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).</P>
      <P>Following digitising and validation against aerial photography of the 7.02 hectares claimed by the person concerned in 1996, it appears that an over-declaration may have occurred.  My Department has arranged to issue a map of the digitised land to the person concerned to determine if such an over-declaration exists.  As soon as the maps are returned, the case will be finalised and any outstanding payments, if due, will issue.</P>

      <P>The person named made an application for six animals on the ten month special beef premium in July 1997.  This application has been processed for payment.  However, the applicant failed to lodge an area aid application in 1997.  In such <Col N="181" /> cases payment is made on eligible animals under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes on up to 15 livestock units firstly taking account of any milk quota held at 1 April 1997 and any ewes applied on under the 1997 ewe premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied on 41 ewes representing 6.15 livestock units under the 1997 ewe premium scheme.  he does not hold a milk quota and did not apply under the 1997 suckler cow scheme.  He is, therefore, entitled to be paid special beef premium on the six eligible animals submitted representing a further 3.6 livestock units.  Payment cannot issue, however, until a definitive position as regards Ireland's national special beef premium quota usage has been determined.  It is unlikely that the payment can be made before April 1998.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for special beef premium on 30 January 1997 in respect of 43 ten month animals.  A second ten month application in respect of six animals was received on 29 May 1997.  A 22 month application in respect of 41 animals was received on 10 January 1997.  Advance payments in respect of these three applications issued to him on 24 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The person applied on 4 December 1997 for 22 month special beef premium in respect of 15 animals.  It is expected that payments in respect of December 1997 applications will commence in the next fortnight.  Balancing payments under the 1997 special beef premium scheme cannot commence until such time as national quota usage for 1997 has been determined.  Quota usage is determined by reference to the overall number of animals deemed eligible for payment of the ten months premium.  The definitive position will not be known until April 1998.</P>

      <P>The Diseases of Animals (BSE) (Specified Risk Material) Order, 1997 provides for the exclusion of specified risk materials from the human food and animal feed chains.  Specified risk material is defined in this Order as follows: the skull, the brain, the eyes and spinal cord of bovines aged over 12 months; the skull, the brain, the eyes and spinal cord of a caprine or ovine animal which has a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum and the spleen of a caprine or ovine animal.</P>

      <P>At present there is one processing plant, Monery By-Products Limited, Crossdoney, County Cavan, approved by this Department to render these materials.  The rendered product, all of which must be destroyed and cannot therefore be used for feed or any other purpose, is held in Department approved dedicated stores pending export for final disposal by incineration.  So far this year, a total of 3,600 tonnes of SRM has been sent to Monery for rendering and ultimate destruction.</P>

      <P>It is my Department's policy to trace the progeny and birth cohorts of BSE affected animals, to slaughter such cattle and to ensure that material from them does not enter the food or feed chains.  This approach is taken for precautionary reasons based on the hypothesis that birth cohort animals are likely to have consumed similar feed to the affected animals while the possibility of maternal transmission of BSE has not been excluded.  As there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of BSE, the other cattle in herds in which progeny and cohort cattle are <Col N="185" /> located are not considered to be at any greater risk of contracting BSE than cattle elsewhere. Consequently, they are not slaughtered or subjected to restrictions or tests.  The current owners of progeny and cohort animals are advised that these animals have been traced for BSE eradication purposes.</P>

      <P>The person named has applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1998 national reserve.  I have accepted the recommendations of the quota review group which gave priority for the allocation of quota from this reserve to eligible applicants with low livestock units.  It is estimated that all the available quota will be utilised by eligible applicants with fewer than ten livestock units.  As the person already has 20 livestock units, she is unlikely to receive an allocation of quota from this reserve.</P>

      <P>The person has been paid in full in respect of 1997 cattle and sheep headage.  An advance payment of £336.55 issued to the person concerned on 28 November 1997 in respect of a suckler cow premium payment.  Before the balance of the premium payment can issue all of the forage area declared by the person concerned must be validated by the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).</P>
      <P>Following digitising and validation against aerial photography of the 24-54 hectares claimed by the person concerned in 1997, it appears that an over-declaration may have occurred.  My Department has arranged to issue a map of the digitised land to the person concerned to determine if such an over-declaration exists.  As soon as the maps are returned, the case will be finalised and any outstanding payments, if due, will issue.</P>

      <P>The requirement that purchasers of prize bonds must purchase a minimum of two bonds, at a total cost of £10, was introduced in March 1992, by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The reason for its introduction was that the cost of processing purchases of single prize bonds had become uneconomic, the minimum purchase requirement having remained at £5 since the introduction of prize bonds in 1957.  Any future changes would be a matter for the National Treasury Management Agency, since responsibility for the management of the prize bond scheme has been delegated to it.  I understand that the agency has, at present, no plans to change this requirement.</P>

      <P>On budget day the Department of Finance forecast an income tax yield of £5,522 million for 1998. This was based on an expected outturn of £5,194 million for 1997 and an increase of 6.3 per cent in 1998.  The actual outturn for 1997 was £5,218 million, £24 million higher than expected.  This additional buoyancy is expected to be carried into this year.</P>
      <P>Data are available for the first two months of the year.  These indicate that income tax receipts are over 9 per cent higher than the same period last year reflecting the impact of both higher employment and earnings.  At this early stage the impact of budget day changes have not taken effect, so it is not our intention to revise our forecasts for the year as a whole other than to reflect the improved outturn for 1997.  As usual, I will be issuing a detailed statement on the Exchequer Returns at the end of the March quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the general approach, as part of their published code of approval practice, is to approve a group scheme in which two or more employers participate provided that the employers are sufficiently closely associated to be treated as carrying on a single trade or undertaking.  This condition is met if the employers all belong to a group of companies forming a single financial unit, e.g. if they are parent and subsidiary, or fellow subsidiaries of the same parent.  For this purpose, a company may be regarded as a subsidiary if at least 50 per cent of its equity share capital is owned by the other, directly or indirectly.  Alternatively, even though no parent-subsidiary relationship exists, there may be enough links between the employers to warrant a group scheme based on close association through permanent community of interest.  Such links could be common management or shareholder, interchangeable or jointly employed staff and interdependent operations e.g. one selling the bulk of the other's products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> However, it is a requirement for approval of a group scheme that the rules must provide for the withdrawal of an employer who ceases to be sufficiently closely associated with, or related to, the other employer participants in that scheme. Where the seceding employer is continuing in business, the assets of the group scheme which would relate to that employer and its employees may form the nucleus of a new scheme, or be transferred to another group scheme in which the employer has become eligible to participate.  In addition, there may be circumstances where a transfer payment would be made to an existing scheme of a new employer i.e. in a takeover where the business of the company being taken over would be integrated with the existing business of the purchasing company.  Existing rules provide for certain transitional arrangements following a transfer of ownership of a company.  This is the general position.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to go into details on the implications of a possible transfer of ownership of TEAM Aer Lingus to an outside company.  It can be said, however, that in relation to a possible transfer of ownership of TEAM Aer Lingus, any arrangements entered into in that connection, in respect of pensions, would have to comply with the published code of approval practice.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in so far as Revenue becomes aware of the practices described by the Deputy these will be investigated and appropriate action taken.  However, it is important that such information should be made available to the relevant authorities and if the Deputy is aware of any particular instances I would be obliged if he would provide it to the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Facilities have been made available to worker representatives to enable them to bring any cases where they consider abuses, such as those suggested by the Deputy, are taking place to official notice.  In addition, union representatives are entitled to sit on the black economy monitoring group, which operates under the aegis of Programme 2000.  This group includes representatives from employers, from the unions, from Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  There is a special sub-committee of the black economy monitoring group which deals with the construction industry.  Union members of the group are free to call for a meeting of this group, at which any difficulties can be brought to the notice of Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Revenue conducted over 2,000 audits in the construction sector during 1997 which yielded £19 million.</P>
      <P>As part of their ongoing audit programme in the industry and by way of a special project which is being undertaken at present Revenue monitor all aspects of compliance in the industry.  The special programme is focused on detecting failure by employers to operate PAYE/PRSI and levies from employees and to make the appropriate employers' contribution to PRSI.  Extra resources have been devoted to the campaign, which will be conducted nationwide.  Where necessary, it is intended that inspectors of taxes will be able to call on the assistance of the Revenue mobile service.</P>

      <P>The Government has commissioned a study into the recent rise in house prices with particular reference to Dublin.

      <P>Where the DIRT regime applies, there are no exemptions from DIRT for individuals resident in the State.  A review was previously carried out by the Revenue Commissioners to see if it was possible to introduce some form of exemption in certain cases that arose.  However, no practicable solution was found.  The difficulties mainly arise from the arrangements that would be necesary to police an exemption system.  However, under certain circumstances DIRT may be refunded i.e. people aged 65 years or over (or people whose spouses are over 65 years of age), and individuals who are unable to look after themselves due to permanent ill health.  Refunds apply to the extent that the individuals would not otherwise be liable to tax on the interest income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the introduction of the DIRT system, consideration was given to a more general refund system.  However, a number of significant problems were identified at that time.  Among these was the very real possibility of tax evasion. The more effective countering of tax evasion was one of the primary reasons for the introduction of DIRT in the first instance.  This could arise if an account was opened in the name of an individual with no liability to income tax (e.g. a child) for the purposes of evading DIRT.  In addition, operating a general refund system would lead to several administrative problems not to mention the significant costs involved, given the significant numbers of potential cases which would need to be assessed in any one financial year. <Col N="197" /> It should be borne in mind that DIRT raises a significant amount of tax, £150 million in 1997.  If any general exemption scheme were to be introduced, the yield would be greatly reduced and this would have obvious consequences for Government policy.  The potential for abuse of a general refund system as well as the costs that would have to be incurred to operate such a system are still valid reasons for not extending the refund provisions allowed for in the DIRT legislation.  Consequently, I have no plans, at present, to extend these refund arrangements to other categories, such as children.</P>

      <P>Government investment schemes comprise, essentially, Government Bonds, Exchequer notes and the personal savings schemes operated for the NTMA by An Post.</P>
      <P>As regards tax evasion, Government investment schemes are subject to relevant powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  A register of holders of Government bonds is held in the Central Bank, and a register of holders of Exchequer notes is kept by the NTMA.  The Revenue Commissioners have the power to seek the names and addresses of holders where interest is paid.  The Revenue Commissioners also have power to apply to the High Court or the Appeals Commissioners to gain access to the accounts in a financial institution of a named individual, if they suspect that tax is being evaded.  Moreover, they can apply to the High Court for an order &ldquo;prohibiting for such period as the Judge may consider proper any transfer of, or dealings with, without the consent of the judge, any assets or moneys of the person to whom the order relates that are in the custody of the financial institution at the time that the order is made &mdash; section 908, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards money-laundering and the proceeds of crime, section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 provides for the proper identification of customers and for the keeping of records of identification and of transactions.  It also provides that, where there are suspicions of money laundering, they are to be reported to the Garda Síochána. Government Bonds are not sold directly to individual purchasers.  Exchequer notes are sold to individual applicants only on production of satisfactory identification.  An Post requires verification of identity on the opening of a new POSB deposit account, or in respect of individual transactions, <Col N="198" /> or linked transactions, amounting to more than £10,000 from new or unverified existing Savings Certificates/Bonds or Prize Bonds customers.  An Post has issued detailed instructions to staff in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Where proceeds of crime are identified, there are provisions, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 for applications to be made to the courts for the freezing and seizure of the assets concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 174, 176 and 177 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 introduced reliefs which allowed a deduction from rental income of a portion of the capital cost incurred <Col N="200" /> on the construction, conversion or refurbishment of a rental property by a person assessable under Case V. The purpose of the relief was to encourage the provision of reasonably priced rental residential accommodation.  The reliefs were available nationwide until 31 March 1984 and in a restricted form until 31 March 1987.  The section 23 reliefs were re-introduced by section 27 Finance Act, 1988 until end July 1992 in certain circumstances since when the reliefs have only been available within designated urban renewal areas, designated resort areas and certain off-shore islands.</P>
    <P>The areas throughout the country where tax reliefs for the provision of rented residential accommodation (section 23 reliefs) are available are the Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks Area, areas designated under the 1994 urban renewal scheme (35 centres) and under the 1995 scheme of reliefs for the renewal and improvement of residential accommodation on certain islands (23 islands).  In addition, these reliefs are available in designated resort areas under the pilot scheme for the renewal and improvement of certain resort areas (15 areas) provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that the accommodation is primarily used for letting to tourists and is occupied for no other purposes from April to October each year.</P>
    <P>The centres designated under these schemes where the section 23 reliefs apply are set out in the attached Appendix.  The 20 centres in Leinster where tax reliefs for the provision of rented residential accommodation are available are marked with an asterisk.  * A separate list shows those 12 centres in Leinster where certain areas benefited from section 23 reliefs under the 1986 urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>A new urban renewal scheme will be introduced with effect from 1 August 1998 under which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will designate areas.  The taxation details of the scheme are the subject of a Committee Stage amendment.  In addition, a pilot rural renewal scheme will be introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill for the upper Shannon region, including all of County Longford.  Both of these schemes will have section 23 type incentives.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Appendix</P>
    <P>The areas designated under the 1994 Urban Renewal Scheme where section 23 reliefs are available are in the following 35 centres (Asterisk denotes an area in Leinster):</P>
    <P>Certain areas of the five county boroughs&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dublin* (including the Temple Bar Area and the Custom House Docks Area), Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Organisations such as the Dublin branch of the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association are funded by the health boards under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, in respect of services provided in the functional area of the relevant board. I note that the branch is already in touch with the Eastern Health Board about the matter and that a meeting was held with senior health board officers yesterday.  I understand that the parties have agreed to carry out a complete review of the role, work and financing of the organisation with <Col N="203" /> a view to agreeing its core service activity and associated funding to ensure its future viability.</P>
    <P>An additional £3 million revenue has been provided this year for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, of which £1.080 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board.  Priorities for the allocation of this funding will be decided by the board in consultation with the local co-ordinating committee on physical and sensory disability services.  The voluntary sector organisations are represented on this committee and the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association should ensure that it has its funding needs assessed in this process.  The association also received £78,000 late last year for aids and appliances.  I understand that the association will be making a national lottery application in relation to a summer project which they are planning.  I will give this application sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <Quest>the number of homeless children in each health board area; the accommodation provided by each health board for children who are homeless; and the additional resources, if any, being provided to each health board to provide additional accommodation to tackle the problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature and extent of the problem of homeless young people varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Because of the transient nature of the problem and the transient lifestyle of some young people it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless young people throughout Ireland. However, it is recognised that the problem is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region. On average 12 young people per night present to the social work service operating outside normal office hours and the Eastern Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year.</P>
      <P>Currently the Eastern Health Board has a total of 160 emergency places available to care for out of home young people.  These include 44 emergency/short-term residential placements, 29 emergency carer families and 87 supported lodgings placements.</P>
      <P>The board also operates a day project which offers care, welfare and recreation support for up to ten young people who are considered to be at risk during the day.</P>
      <P>An additional £2 million was approved late in 1997 to the Eastern Health Board to fund a number of initiatives for homeless children in Dublin. This funding will enable the creation of an additional 30 places for homeless young people and the establishment of a day-and-night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate these young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services.  The reception centre will have a small number of emergency beds available to homeless young people where no other placement is available.  The board also plans to develop a further three localised emergency facilities in suburban areas over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The other seven health boards have a range of services to cater for the young homeless in accordance with identified needs and service priorities in their respective regions.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board provides funding towards a project for disadvantaged youth in Tullamore.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has a total of nine emergency residential places available to meet the needs of the young homeless in its region.  The board is actively seeking permanent accommodation for the adolescent boys hostel and outreach service for which funding of £220,000 has already been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board does not have accommodation specifically for the young homeless.  Out of home young people are either accommodated in the board's residential care centres or arrangements are made to provide supported <Col N="207" /> lodgings, or supported rented accommodation depending on the young person's needs. The board plans to further develop their residential care service to meet the very troubled adolescents including those who may be homeless.</P>
    <P>The North-Western Health Board has a total of eight hostel and emergency accommodation places to cater for the needs of the young homeless in the region.  An additional £17,000 revenue funding was made available in 1997 for the board's homeless hostel.  At least two additional places for out of home young people will be available in the new children's residential facility in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board funds the Dochas service for out of home girls in Waterford which has six places.  Other supports such as supported lodgings and supported rented accommodation are also available in the region.  An additional £40,000 is being made available in 1998 to develop supervised lodgings placements with approved families.  It is also planned to expand the service provided by Dochas.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has a range of services to cater for the needs of the young homeless.  Four emergency residential placements and six placements in semi-independent accommodation are currently available for girls in the region.  The emergency hostel for boys (currently closed for renovation but due to re-open in April/May) will accommodate up to six boys. Other options available are independent accommodation, digs/supervised accommodation and support and advice for homeless adolescents.  The board plan to identify additional supervised lodgings <Col N="208" /> placements to cater for the needs of the young homeless.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board provides a service for homeless children in a six bed hostel/ residential facility.  Every assistance is given to those who find themselves homeless.  The board is endeavouring to address the problem by preventing homelessness in the first place through a process of support services and by placing emphasis on the resettlement of young people who use the residential facility.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, and up to the end of 1997 an additional allocation of £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services including services for the young homeless.  A further £8 million has been available for this purpose in 1998.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  Data for 1980, 1985 and 1990 refer to the in-patient bed complement of all publicly funded acute hospitals at 31 December.  The 1995 figures refer to the average number of in-patient beds available for use over the full year taking beds that have been temporarily opened or closed into account.  As data for 1997 are not yet complete, figures refer to the average number of beds available for use over the January to June period.  Day beds and beds in district, psychiatric and private hospitals are excluded from the table.</P>
      <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on bed numbers as a measure of hospital resources.  In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in acute hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care and a marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at outpatient level.</P>

      <P>In 1997 the Eastern Health Board established a working group on child prostitution to establish in consultation with other appropriate statutory and voluntary agencies the extent of child prostitution in the Eastern Health Board area and to make recommendations regarding measures that can be taken to address the problem.</P>
      <P>The working group noted that there were no accurate figures on the extent of child prostitution in Ireland.  However, as part of its work the group undertook a survey to investigate the scale of the problem.  The survey identified forty seven children and ten young people aged 18 or over who were involved in prostitution at some stage. The report points out that this does not imply that 57 children were all involved in prostitution at the same time.</P>

    <P>The vast majority operated in inner city Dublin. A very significant finding from the survey was that 46 of the 57 children either had, or were, experiencing homelessness.</P>
    <P>The central recommendation of the report was that sufficient numbers of quality placements should be made available which children could readily access and the board is acting on this recommendation.  The board is continuing to develop family placements, including additional carer families and supported lodgings, for teenagers and it also plans to develop three localised emergency residential facilities in suburban areas over the next three years.</P>
    <P>As a further measure, late in 1997, my Department approved additional funding of £100,000 to the Eastern Health Board to assist in tackling the backlog of fostering assessments.</P>
    <P>Plans are also advancing for a day-and-night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate homeless young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services.  The centre will have six beds to accommodate young people who are unable to access more regular placements.  The centre will provide a gateway to specialist services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for early intervention has been well proven both in Ireland and internationally.  As such, each health board funds a range of early intervention services for children and families which are provided by, or in partnership with, voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services provided include the community mothers programme, family support services, day nurseries, family centres, family resources centres, neighbourhood youth projects, after-school and other school support projects, parenting programmes and pre-school services for the disadvantaged.  The type of service provided varies throughout the country as provision is based on identified needs in particular areas and on services <Col N="212" /> priorities which has been identified by health boards.  The main objectives of these services are to relieve poverty, to compensate for material or other disadvantage in individual families, to prevent serious child rearing problems which would involve the removal of children from home and to strengthen resources for families in local areas with social needs.</P>
    <P>The public health nursing service, speech and language therapy service, developmental clinics, school medical examinations and vision and screening are also aimed at early identification and intervention.</P>
    <P>Health boards are committed to the expansion of these services as resources permit and to increasing the amount of resources allocated to preventative services.</P>
    <P>Each health board produces a report on the adequacy of the child care and family support services in their board on an annual basis.  These reports address the provision of early intervention services for children and families and I have arranged for copies of the reports in respect of 1996 to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced a series of initiatives aimed at reducing hospital waiting lists and waiting times in target areas, inlcuding the type of circumstances mentioned by the Deputy.  These include&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Where applicable, agencies have been notified in their determination of net expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialities targeted for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" />&mdash; Where agencies have not already done so, they have requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, my Department has recently written to the agencies participating in the waiting list initiatives requesting further details of their targets for reductions in waiting lists and waiting times.  When this information comes to hand my Department will be in a position to establish a more detailed national picture of what can be expected to be achieved with the moneys allocated under the 1998 waiting list initiative.  In this regard, a total of £9 million has been allocated so far in respect of the 1998 waiting list initiative, with a further £3 million yet to be allocated, representing a 50 per cent in waiting list funding over the 1997 allocation.</P>

    <P>The determination of pension increases in individual cases is a matter for each local authority. Under the terms of a circular letter which issued in November last authorising local authorities to implement a Government decision applying increases in the pensions of public servants who retired before the commencement dates of PCW restructuring pay deals, only increases which represented permanent additions to the pay scales in question would apply to pensioners.  The long service increment payable to clerical officers and library assistants, which is only payable on a personal basis to those serving on 1 June 1996, is not a permanent feature of the new pay scales and <Col N="214" /> may not be passed on to persons who retired before 1 June 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 211, 212 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent assessment by local authorities of the numbers of homeless people was in respect of the position at 29 March 1996 and was carried out in conjunction with the local authorities' assessment of housing needs at that date.  Details of the assessment are contained in Part XIII of the Department's Housing Statistics bulletin for 1996, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.  The next assessment of the numbers of homeless people will take place in conjunction with the next assessment of housing needs in March 1999.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless persons.  The maintenance of the local authority housing programme at a high and consistent level in recent years benefits the homeless in common with other housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing schemes, administered by local authorities, has been for homeless persons.  The terms and conditions of the schemes were recently significantly improved and they will continue to play an important part in meeting housing needs, including those of homeless people.  In 1997 capital funding amounting <Col N="215" /> to over £3.5 million was paid by local authorities under the capital assistance scheme in respect of accommodation for homeless people; details are set out in schedule 1.  To date in 1998 £181,633 has been paid to voluntary bodies for the provision of accommodation for homeless people as shown in schedule 2; further payments will be made in 1998 as projects mature for payment.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital funding outlined, my Department pays grants towards the administrative and general expenses of a number of approved voluntary housing bodies, some of which provide services for the homeless.  Details of the amounts paid in 1997 and approved for 1998 are set out in schedule 3.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have wide powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 to provide or fund the cost of accommodation for homeless people.  This includes contributions to voluntary bodies providing such accommodation and meet the cost of accommodation arranged directly by local authorities themselves or by the health boards on their behalf.</P>
    <P>My Department recoups local authorities 90 per cent of their expenditure under section 10.  In 1997 some £6 million was recouped to authorities <Col N="216" /> under these arrangements.  A full breakdown of the payments made to individual voluntary bodies by local authorities is not available in my Department.  However, in 1997, recoupment amounting to over £1 million was made to various local authorities in respect of their payments to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community, Focus and the Salvation Army.  The provision for &ldquo;section 10&rdquo; recoupments in 1998 is £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also fund and are recouped by the Department the cost of:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the operation of day-time and after hours referral services for homeless people seeking accommodation in the Dublin area; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the operation of the Dublin Homeless Initiative covering Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow which was established to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for the homeless in the Dublin region and to provide a framework for a more co-operative and unified approach by the statutory authorities working with the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>I will continue to have the situation regarding accommodation for homeless people monitored and kept under review.</P>

      <P>All local authorities were invited by my Department in December 1997 to submit applications under the Government's serviced land initiative for which £15 million in Exchequer funding is being provided over the three year period commencing in 1998.  When local authority contributions are taken into account, an estimated £37.5 million will be spent under the initiative.  Applications for funding under the initiative, in respect of some 150 proposed schemes costing over £110 million, have been received from 46 local authorities.</P>
      <P>These applications are currently being examined by my Department having regard to criteria such as the demand for housing development, the availability of serviced land and the adequacy of existing or planned capacity in water and sewerage systems to accommodate new development. Apart from general discussions with some local authorities on the terms and conditions of the initiative, there have been no detailed discussions on the schemes submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Designations under the proposed new urban renewal scheme will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.</P>
      <P>Last November, guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme were issued to local authorities. These guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, set out the criteria which local authorities are asked to use in the selection of urban areas for which integrated area plans are to be prepared.  The document also provides guidance on the types of issues which those plans are expected to address.</P>
      <P>In the context of the criteria for selecting areas, the guidelines deal with the important issue of the size of urban areas likely to be suitable for consideration under the new scheme.  The point made in the guidelines is that very few towns of less than 6,000 population received designation under the schemes up to now and that such towns would be likely to have greater difficulty qualifying under the criteria for the new scheme.</P>
      <P>While the 6,000 population threshold is not a strict limit as such, it reflects the fact that the scheme is concerned with urban renewal and that it will therefore, of its nature, be confined to areas with strong urban characteristics.  The indicative population level also reflects the fact that the successful implementation of a scheme of this nature in an urban area requires a minimum level of scale.</P>
      <P>The designation of an area under the new scheme could only be considered if it falls within an urban area which the relevant local authority decides is a priority area for which an integrated area plan should be prepared.  In that context, if a local authority should decide to prepare such a plan for a town with a population of less than 6,000 the relevant local authority would have to demonstrate how the town meets the criteria for the new scheme.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99, which partly funds the non-national roads programme, is an integrated package of investment in roads, public transport, ports and airports.  The bulk of the investment on non-national roads in 1998 will be spent on the maintenance or restoration of existing roads.  Such works do not involve significant environmental impacts and, in general, the non-national roads programme is generally designed to harmonise with the environment and to cause a minimum of inconvenience to the public.</P>
      <P>Where schemes of potentially significant environmental impact arise under the programme, the Road Act, 1993 provides for an appropriate and transparent evaluation of projects, including the preparation of environmental impact statements where necessary.  For certain road schemes for which an EIS is not required to be carried out, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1994 and 1995 provide for procedures of public notice and comment for various categories of road works as prescribed.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The SWA scheme is administered by the eight regional health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for mortgage interest supplement, the claimant must satisfy all the general conditions of entitlement to SWA as set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 and prescribed regulations S.I. No. 382, 1995.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and the board has advised that she does not qualify for a mortgage interest supplement as the household means exceed the statutory limit.  The case was appealed to the WHB appeals officer who upheld the decision.</P>

      <P>Following a recent review of his entitlements, a deciding officer assessed the weekly means of the person concerned at £86 from 4 February 1998, derived from income from a holding and benefit from his spouse's British pension.  This assessment reduced his weekly unemployment assistance entitlement from £39.50 to £25.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> It has since come to light that a further prorata pension being paid to his spouse must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Where one of a couple is entitled to pension and the other is entitled to unemployment assistance, the total amount payable to the couple is the maximum amount that either would get if claiming for the other as an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>In this case, the maximum amount payable to the couple is £45.60, which given the spouse's rate of pension of £27.80, entitles the person concerned to a payment of £17.80. A revised deciding officer's decision, based on this assessment, issued to him on 2 March 1998.</P>
    <P>It is open to the person concerned, if he so desires, to appeal this decision to the independent Social Wefare Appeals Office.  A form for this purpose may be obtained from his local office in Belmullet.</P>

      <P>A bilateral social security agreement between Ireland and Canada came into force on 1 January 1992.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the agreement is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked in Ireland and who have worked or resided in Canada.</P>
      <P>The payments covered by the agreement, in Ireland, are old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widows and widowers contributory pension, invalidity pension, orphan's contributory allowance and death grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person fails to satisfy the contribution conditions for these payments based on his/her Irish insurance record alone, the agreement allows for social security contributions and/or periods of residence in Canada to be taken into consideration in the qualification for the Irish benefits listed above.  A similar arrangement <Col N="226" /> exists in relation to entitlement to Canadian pensions.</P>
    <P>For instance, if a person has worked in Ireland and paid social insurance contributions (a minimum of 52 social insurance contributions must be paid or credited) and satisfies the minimum Canadian social insurance conditions s/he may qualify for an Irish pension based solely on their contributions paid/credited in Ireland; and/or a Canadian pension based solely on contributions and/or periods of residence in Canada; or if s/he does not have enough contributions paid in Ireland or sufficient contributions and/or periods of residence in Canada, s/he may qualify for a proportional Irish or Canadian pension, or both, based on a combination of Irish PRSI contributions and Canadian contributions and/or periods of residence.</P>
    <P>The agreement also allows workers who are sent by their Irish employer to work in Canada, for short periods, to remain in the Irish social insurance system, thereby being exempt from double payment of social security contributions.</P>
    <P>Recipients of Irish and/or Canadian social security pensions, who reside in Ireland, may be entitled to the free schemes available under the Irish social welfare system, subject to satisfying the relevant qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>There is also a bilateral social security understanding between Ireland and Québec containing similar protection of pension rights of workers who have worked in both Ireland and Québec and exemption from double payment of social insurance contributions.  Entitlement to the free schemes under our national social welfare system also extends to those who reside in Ireland, satisfy the relevant conditions and are in receipt of a payment under the bilateral understanding between Ireland and Québec.</P>

      <P>In relation to the current work to reconstruct Moran's Bridge, Mullingar, I am advised that as a result of the restricted nature of the site at the bridge, the navigation design parameters (which include a minimum acceptable width of navigation channel, a maximum navigational water level and navigational air draft) had to be reduced to a minimum acceptable standard in order to accommodate the change in the vertical alignment of Bellview Road and Delvin Road.  Therefore, due to technical reasons, a pedestrian walkway below the bridge was not feasible and it could not be accommodated.  The Deputy may wish to note that, for various reasons, pedestrian walkways do not exist underneath every canal bridge on the Royal Canal.</P>

      <i>* Note</i>: Figures are provisional.</P>
    <P>With reference to Question No. 297 the number of applications dealt with in the District Courts pursuant to Family Law Maintenance Acts in the legal year ending 31 July 1997 is 3,724.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of this figure, indicating the number of orders made and whether granted to a spouse or an unmarried parent, is not available at this time and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as the collation of same has been completed.</P>
    <P>With reference to Question No. 298, set out on the table following are the number of applications made and orders granted in the District Courts under the Child Care Act, 1991 in relation to care orders and supervision orders in respect of the legal year ending 31 July 1997, which is the first year for which statistics were collated regarding the Child Care Act.  Figures are not available relating to the number of emergency or interim orders.</P>
    <P>The statistics provided in this table supercede the statistics I already provided in this regard to the Deputy in response to his similar Dáil question of 29 January 1998.</P>
    <P>When interpreting these statistics the Deputy should be aware that when an application for a care order is made on behalf of a number of children in the same family, some offices count each <Col N="231" /> child in the family concerned as being the subject of a separate care application-order while other offices, i.e. Dublin, only count multi-child applications as one application-order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> Such discrepancies in the basis of counting statistics will be overcome when a networked I.T. system is installed in all District Court offices.</P>

      <Quest>whether he regards it as appropriate that a person (details supplied) convicted of sexual abuse and acknowledged to be a paedophile all his life is serving a prison sentence in Castlerea, a place of detention which is an open prison; whether he regards it as generally appropriate that persons convicted of crimes involving sexual abuse serve their sentences in open prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is a long established practice not to comment on individual cases and I do not propose to make an exception to this practice in this instance.  I would like to say, however, that Castlerea place of detention is not an open prison.  While it has been described as a &ldquo;semi-open&rdquo; institution it has, in common with traditional closed institutions, a high level of perimeter security including a 25ft high wall.</P>
      <P>Transfers of prisoners between the various institutions, including to and from the place of detention at Castlerea, take place on a regular basis for sound operational reasons and are an essential element in the overall management of the prison system.  The fact that a person is currently serving a sentence in Castlerea place of detention does not necessarily mean that the whole of his sentence will be served in that institution.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to generalise I will say that I do not consider it appropriate that persons convicted of sex offences should serve their sentences in open centres.  There are approximately 265 persons convicted of sex offences in custody at present and I can assure the Deputy that not one of them is in an open centre.</P>

      <P>The decision whether or not to issue small public service vehicle drivers licences is a matter exclusively for the Garda Commissioner in accordance with Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 (S.  I. 191 of 1963) as amended.  I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that in accordance with the above regulations an applicant must provide a written undertaking that, if the licence is granted, the driver's services will be available as a driver of a small public service vehicle for at least 40 hours in each week and that in any period of three consecutive days the driver will not so drive for more than 11 hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner or his authorised officer is obliged to grant the licence if he is satisfied that the applicant, amongst other requirements, is a fit and proper person to hold a licence to drive a small public service vehicle drivers licence, and <Col N="235" /> the applicant is not engaged in any occupation which, in the opinion of the Commissioner or his authorised officer is likely to impair his/her efficiency or to conflict with his/her responsibilities or to be incompatible with his employment as a small public service vehicle drivers licence.</P>
    <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that, where an applicant is refused a licence by the Commissioner, he/she has a right of appeal to the District Court under the relevant regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, all holders of small public service vehicle driver licences must renew their drivers licences on an annual basis and satisfy the Commissioner that they are fulfilling the conditions as laid down in the regulations.</P>

The special arrangements are intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidates performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment as distinct from attempting to compensate in any way for a lack of ability or knowledge on the part of the candidate.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep this area under review to ensure that proper allowances are made for candidates with special needs.</P>

      <P>Physical education facilities encompass indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas such as basketball, tennis courts and playing fields.  Virtually all schools have at least one element of these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal factor which determines progress in this area is the amount of capital funding available <Col N="240" /> in any given financial year.  The question of providing capital for the purchase of a site for Coláiste Mhuire, Johnstown, County Kilkenny, to provide additional physical education facilities can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the demand for additional accommodation and repairs to existing accommodation in schools throughout the country it is not possible to state when this request for additional playing facilities will be facilitated.  However, I can assure the Deputy should financial circumstances permit, the school will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256, 278, 283 and 284 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools in question will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>At present there are four special schools and three special classes attached to mainstream national schools, catering for pupils with a specific learning disability.  Three of the special schools are in Dublin and one in Cork.  The special classes are based in Malahide and Tallaght.  My Department will consider any proposal from the board of management of a school to establish similar classes where a need for them has been identified.</P>

      <P>A very important part of the Rutland Street project which was developed by the Department of Education in collaboration with the Bernard Van Leer Foundation was to carry out research on its effectiveness in assisting children in developing their cognitive skills and, by so doing, to prepare them for the work of the primary school.</P>
      <P>A follow-up study carried out by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, involved comparisons between students who had attended the Rutland Street pre-school &mdash; the experimental group in the original study &mdash; and a group of students who had not attended the centre &mdash; the control group in the initial study &mdash; when they were aged 16 to 18 years.  The results indicated that the experimental group stayed on longer in school and 10 per cent of them took the leaving certificate examination while none of the control group did.  Two students went on to third level education.  It also emerged that a greater proportion of girls than boys stayed on at school and sat for State examinations.</P>
      <P>As a result of the rehousing programme, much of the population which was resident in the area has now moved and it would be very difficult to trace the students who were involved in the original valuation who would now be 32 years of age. However, other pilot projects are being evaluated and it is intended to conduct longitudinal studies at appropriate stages in the educational lives of the populations involved in those projects to determine the effects of the interventions on the life prospects of the young people involved.</P>

Section 6 of the Bill sets out a series of fundamental objectives including the promotion of equality of access to and participation in education and the promotion of the means whereby students may benefit from education.  Section 9 of the Bill addresses the functions of a school and includes the duty of ensuring that the educational needs of all students, including those with special educational needs, are provided for.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the above measures, which encompass the needs of children with severe or profound mental handicap, are fully compatible with the O'Donoghue High Court judgment in relation to such children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, sets out a general framework for the structure and development of the education system.  It does not provide for the specific recognition of any particular type of early childhood or other education, including Montessori education, nor would it be appropriate for a Bill of this kind to do so.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, teachers with the Montessori qualification, which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, are already recognised by my Department as qualified to teach in special shcools for students who are mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed or hearing impaired.  The Education Bill places particular emphasis on meeting the special educational needs of these and other students who may also have special needs.  In addition, section 24 of the Bill provides for the numbers and qualifications of teachers of a school, who will be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Teachers with the Montessori qualification would come within the remit of this section and should there be any extension of the recognition of the Montessori qualification in the future, this would also come within the remit of section 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I recently announced the establishment of the National Forum on Early Childhood Education which will take place in Dublin Castle during the week beginning 23 March 1998.  The <Col N="250" /> forum will consider all aspects of early childhood education, including the Montessori method.  The outcome of the forum will be an important input into a White Paper on early childhood education, work on which will commence after the conclusion of the forum.</P>
    <P>I am sure you will appreciate for me to pre-empt the findings of the national forum by making any statement on the matter at this juncture.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of these schemes, mature students are defined as students who are at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to an approved course and mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>

Subject to the requirement in the primary sector that the schools must close for the months of July and August, the choice of vacation days on which schools will be closed is a matter for individual boards of management or vocational education committees, which are charged with the direct governance of schools.</P>
      <P>To guarantee that its school is in operation for the prescribed minimum number of days, each managerial authority, in planning the school year, must make allowance for days on which the school may have to be closed due to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.  Schools authorities must, therefore, retain discretion in this matter.</P>

      <P>The provision of pre-school services for children with disabilities is the responsibility of the health authorities.  In March of this year I will be holding a National Forum on Early Childhood Education.  The object of the forum is to allow all groups with an interest in early childhood education, including those providing services for children with special needs, to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the development of services in this area.  The outcome of the forum will provide an important input into policy decisions on the future development of pre-school education services.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he has proposed to increase the capitation charge for entry to third level colleges from £150 to £250; if he will reconsider this proposal in view of the representations he has received from colleges and student unions throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this academic year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997-98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I also requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has now <Col N="256" /> completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has recently issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.  I have asked the authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
    <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>
