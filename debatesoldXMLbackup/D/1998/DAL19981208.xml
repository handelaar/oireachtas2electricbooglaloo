      <Quest>if any members of the Government have made joint orders under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, assigning responsibility to specified civil servants for the performance of functions in respect of cross departmental matters; if so, the matters, functions and Departments affected; the proposals, if any, being considered for making these orders in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>No orders have so far been made under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.  As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a similar previous question, the purpose of section 12 of the Act is to provide, as necessary, for the assignment by Ministers or Ministers of State of responsibility to civil servants for cross-departmental issues and the associated accountability arrangements.  The Act also requires, under section 4, that the heads of Departments and offices ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response to these issues.  Ministers are aware of these provisions to which I have previously drawn their attention.</P>
      <P>Issues of policy, of course, cross-departmental boundaries and there is a need to identify new ways of managing such issues more effectively in the future.  The departmental strategy statements approved by Ministers earlier this year and laid before the House have identified a number of cross-departmental issues arising.  I have asked the SMI implementation group to consider appropriate action now in relation to cross-departmental issues.  I expect that such consideration will address the use of section 12 of the 1997 Act as a means of underpinning progress on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the effectiveness of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, for example, would be considerably reinforced if an order was made under section 12 of the relevant Act?  The Minister of State originally had responsibility for two Departments but the Taoiseach saw fit to give him responsibility <Col N="3" /> for a third area.  The inevitable turf wars and bureaucratic loyalties of various Departments will prevail unless an order is made under section 12 assigning officials in the three Departments &mdash; Health and Children, Education and Science, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; to report directly and to be accountable to the Minister of State.  This would enhance his effectiveness as Minister of State and would deal with the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the two issues separately. Deputy Fahey was appointed Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with responsibility for overall children's affairs.  In the day to day contacts between these Departments and the interdepartmental committee he chairs administrative arrangements have been made and are going well. There is no difficulty.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn on the general point.  The whole idea of section 12 is to try to look at what is called the strategic result area and to not only bring Departments together as we do at present but share outputs, resources, policy and funding.  Section 12, as designed in the Act, came from an examination of the New Zealand system.  I recently read, as part of the SMI implementation group's work, an examination of how it works; it is very sophisticated and seems to be very productive.  However, it is not like our present situation, where there is an assignment order that the Minister must sign which gives the Minister total responsibility on a cross-departmental basis.  The format of budgets, outputs and other matters is taken together.  It is very useful and would strengthen the position of a Minister in that situation.</P>
      <P>Frankly, we do not have the structure to do this just now and, while the section has been put into the Act, it would take quite a lot of work.  The implementation group must work in other areas, but it has now turned its attention to this to identify how much work is involved.  The areas that have been identified are in the departmental reports for this year.  A number of areas where this is useful were signalled.  I told both Ministers and the implementation group that we should take a number of them, not all of them, and try to make them work.  That is in the work programme for 1999.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's response.  Does he agree there is a serious systems failure in the Government in regard to the amendments to the Children's Bill, which has completed Second Stage in this House and is awaiting commencement of Committee Stage? Government amendments are still pending and, obviously, the Minister of State is having difficulties drafting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government wrote section 12 into the legislation to which the question refers because of the conflict of loyalty that civil servants have to their Department and the task in hand.  Does the Taoiseach agree, bearing in mind his welcome in principle for the provisions in section 12, that if one looks at the actual performance in the area of childrens' legislation, they are not working?  It may very well not be this matter, but given that the Taoiseach has overall responsibility, does he further agree that the section is not effective and that perhaps giving the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, further effective co-ordinating powers through the establishment of what is <i>de facto</i> a task force would address this issue?  If the Taoiseach agrees, why will he not do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The drafting of amendments has nothing to do with this.  The amendments will be ready by Christmas.  Deputy Fahey is an outstandingly successful Minister of State in this area.  He has done more co-ordination and set up more programmes in the children's area than any of his predecessors.  The number of programmes he introduced, the work he is doing in identifying social exclusion and going to the heart of families while working with organisations such as Barnardo's, which deals with people on the streets, and his enthusiasm for it is greater than that of any Minister of State of this Government or previous ones.  He has no difficulty with co-ordination because he is driving this issue and putting so much energy into it.  People in the Departments are quite keen and anxious to work with him and he is not having difficulties</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is missing the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe what was envisaged for section 12, which was taken directly from the New Zealand system, as part of the work done over the years since the Strategic Management Initiative, is useful.  We should develop a scheme that ensures it operates and we have not done that.  It has worked well elsewhere and we should use it here.  It is a different system from our system of co-ordination over the years.  The Minister of State still deals with different agencies and Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach agrees with it, why does he not implement it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the sheer work and time needed by the implementation group to get around to setting up the scheme.  We have put it into the Act but no work has been done on the issue since 1992.  This issue was identified some years ago and put into the legislation but the putting together of the scheme was not number one on the implementation group's list, or number three for that matter, but the group has been working on it since September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> It has identified a scheme where section 12 will apply to a particular area, for example, and the Minister responsible would set up an interdepartmental group which would share output, policy, resources and funding.  That is entirely different from anything we have done before.  We should build a model that can work and then use it in certain areas.  The departmental reports have identified six or seven areas, which the implementation group has looked at this autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to use this legislation to deal with the crisis in this city's taxi service.  The relevant Ministers in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have been unable to tackle the problems of people who have to queue for three hours at night to get a taxi, and firms who order a taxi during the day and must wait up to an hour.  Business is being lost in the financial services centre because of the lack of adequate taxi services to enable people to catch flights out of Dublin.  If the Taoiseach is to choose an area for joint Departmental action, will he choose the Dublin taxi service, particularly given the current Christmas crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any section of this Act covers that matter.  The Deputy was highly critical when I tried to take an initiative in this area &mdash; he told me it was none of my business, that it was a matter for the local authorities, but I went ahead and at least that initiative has introduced almost 900 additional taxis.  Some of our local authority colleagues in the House have made moves in the past week, in the county councils and Dublin Corporation, which will perhaps assist the ongoing efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that his initiative succeeded in delaying action by the local authorities on taxi numbers, and was designed so to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he now take an initiative to stop people having to wait so long for taxis?  This is causing anger in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject that criticism. For about nine years additional licences were not issued by local authorities but now, for the first time in two decades, we achieved an agreement between the various bodies to issue between 800 and 900 new licences.  The only issue left to decide was whether they should be issued over a three year or four year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the third progress report on the President published by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on 25 November 1998.  The report recommends a number of changes to the Constitution which require serious consideration. These include issues such as the procedure for nominating a presidential candidate, extending the power of the President to confer titles of honour after consultation with the Council of State and reduction of the age of eligibility for election to the office of President to 18 years.</P>
      <P>I understand that the All-Party Committee proposes to publish further progress reports early in 1999.  I am prepared to consult other party leaders when the Government has had an opportunity to consider the reports and I will be in touch with the leaders in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity to read the full report and I thank our colleagues from all parties who make up the committee for their diligent work, not only on this report but on the two previous ones.  I know what the committee is trying to do in its recommendations, moving forward from the report of the Constitutional Review Group.  I favour the recommendations of the latter group in some areas &mdash; I would not support reducing the minimum age limit of presidential candidates to 18 years and I have publicly stated I do not see a requirement for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My stated position in the House, when I answered a question from the Deputy last year, was that I would support looking at the issue again.  On that occasion I referred to the eight or nine times this has been raised in the House over the past half century, by almost every Taoiseach in that time.  The matter should be considered but it needs further examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that last year. The matter has been considered by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which recommended that in some circumstances the President, in consultation with the Council of State, should have the power to confer honours.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on whether that would be good or bad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not considered the issue of an honours scheme.  I favour some way of rewarding and recognising people in the community who have given great service in various areas.  This should not only involve people of seniority, but individuals in the community. There is the Gaisce awards system for young people but there are no other awards.  I do not necessarily agree with the proposed scheme. I do not understand why the Council of State should be increased in size to deal with this issue because the President usually takes decisions based on the advice of the Executive.  The recommendation appears to move away from that principle. However, I have no difficulty with the involvement of the President in an honours system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to consider the role of the Council of State.  I do not understand why the size of the council needs to be increased.  The report appears to suggest that the Council of State is made up of representatives of only one party.  However, that is not the case.  The Council of State also includes former Members of the House who held various positions.</P>

This committee which was set up by the previous Government has been meeting for the past two years ago and has published three reports.  Many of the reports' recommendations, such as the gender proofing recommendation, are non-controversial.  Neither is the recommendation on local government controversial.  The Taoiseach should establish a consultation procedure, as quickly as possible, with his Cabinet colleagues, followed by discussions with party leaders and a debate here as suggested by Deputy Bruton.  The Government would then be in a position to avail of opportunities as they arise. The next such opportunity will be in June.  We should avail of an economical way of amending the Constitution.  I hope all that process will be in place to enable a good package of measures to the put to the people next June.  Will the Taoiseach agree with that timetable?</P>

      <P>I do not want to be pushed on the timescale but I have set out what we propose to do.  We have received reports and expect to receive some more data.  I do not want us to have constitutional referendums willy-nilly.  The committee has done good work and has given us reports which we can examine.  The first two reports have been considered in detail by Departments who have reported back.  The third report has been received.  It recommends tightening up the Constitution in the translation of English to <Col N="10" /> Irish where the language should be gender neutral. We must try to agree a package of measures and discuss them with the party leaders.  I have no difficulty in having them debated in the House when they are ready.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share a concern which seems to form part of the thinking behind the recommendations in the committee's report that politicians cannot be trusted with the allocation of any kind of honours system?  Will he agree in the two areas where we have the power to confer an honour, namely, the Freedom of the City for many of the cities that have a charter to so do, or the invitation to address joint or single Houses of the Oireachtas, that as a body of politicians over generations we have been responsible and economical in terms of the way in which those honours have been allocated?  Will he take into account in his consideration of any proposals that may come before the House because the Executive is the body that will initially propose, that politicians on all sides should not allow themselves to be denigrated into abdicating this responsibility given that our record shows in the areas where we have had that responsibility, we have been highly responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It is for that reason I do not believe we should change it.  I presume the thinking is to refer the matter to the Council of State.  We do not have to do that given that in every other area the President acts on the advice of the Executive, the Executive takes the advice of the House.  I read the file in regard to this matter last spring.  A problem has existed for the past 40 years about the word &lsquo;honours&rsquo;.</P>

      <P>The scheme would recognise people who carry out an enormous amount of work but are unlikely to be granted freedom of the city or be nominated to the Seanad.  A number of Irish people have received recognition outside Ireland for work carried out here and elsewhere.  It is regrettable we do not have some system of recognition here.  The record shows that this has been a divisive issue over the years.  If we could overcome the difficulties that exist, we could reward and recognise distinguished citizens.  This House should have a say in that.</P>

      <Quest>the amount available in the 1999 Estimates for his Department and the Office of the Attorney General for commissioning outside legal advice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25606/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>First, in respect of my Department, no costs have been incurred in 1998 for external legal advice and there is no specific provision in the 1999 Estimate for my Department for commissioning such legal advice.  There is a general provision for consultancies commissioned by my Department from which any such costs would, in the normal course, be met.</P>
      <P>The bodies under the aegis of my Department are directly responsible for payments of costs from their financial allocations within Vote 3, including costs for legal advice, if arising.  No such costs have been incurred during 1998.  The commissioning of legal advice is a matter entirely at the discretion of the bodies.  I am advised that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution may have some minor legal costs arising in 1999.</P>
      <P>External legal advice is sought as a matter of routine by the Office of the Attorney General, including the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The 1998 provision to these offices for fees to counsel and general law expenses is £8.38 million. Expenditure to date amounts to £7.438 million. The expenditure encompasses the full range of legal services involving both civil and criminal cases.  Given the number and range of cases, it is not readily possible to isolate the amounts paid for advice only.  The 1999 provision for fees to counsel and general law expenses is £12.24 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is an acceptable practice in this day and age for an Attorney General of whatever persuasion to dispense these sums of money?  Does he agree it is acceptable that the offices referred to do not have some form of tendering or accountability procedures? The sums of money involved are absolutely staggering.  I am not referring to costs incurred by the DPP but those directly related to the Attorney General of the day, whoever he or she may be.  If the Taoiseach finds the practice unacceptable, as I do, has he obtained a breakdown of the different kinds of advice sought and the pattern, if any, which exists in this regard?  Is an old boys' network in operation here?  When did the Comptroller and Auditor General last examine the operation of this Department to ascertain whether value for money was obtained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the issue of tendering.  Legal advice is sought as a matter of routine by the Office of the Attorney General; it is not planned in advance.  Where it is planned, I have stated the office should seek the best value for money.  However, where the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's Office seek knowledge of specialist areas of law, it is not possible for them to do that.  It is impossible <Col N="12" /> to predict when such needs will arise and the State must be in a position to respond at short notice to them.  A tendering process is not followed in these instances as the offices believe such a process would be impractical.</P>
      <P>However, where matters are planned in advance, the offices are prepared to consider a tendering process, although not with a great degree of enthusiasm.  The Office of Attorney General is required to seek sanction from the Department of Finance.  This is only a recent practice and Members will recall we have already experienced some difficulties in the lifetime of this Government in that regard.  The systems in operation in the Office of the Attorney General have been reviewed in recent years.  The previous Attorney General introduced many reforms.  In spite of this, to isolate the amount paid for legal advice only as opposed to legal services one would have to go through every file.  That is the reason I cannot give a breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say that the amount spent by the office of the Attorney General on legal advice was £8 million this year and that this will increase to £12 million next year? What has been the rate of increase in the cost of legal advice sought from the private sector in the past four to five years and by how much has it exceeded the rate of increase in Government expenditure generally?  Does the Taoiseach consider that this scale of fees indicates a legal system which is not working well and that this issue, the cost of justice, should be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the increase is that there is a huge network in place in the office of the Chief State Solicitor to deal with Army deafness cases.  I do not have the figures but I am aware that they have not increased by very much when the relevant cost is excluded.  There are 11,000 to 12,000 cases in hand which are being dealt with by between 40 and 50 staff.  It was the conclusion of the previous Attorney General and the committee of the House which looked at the matter that, taking all circumstances into account, the State was getting good value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Comptroller and Auditor General been asked to look at the matter and provide a value for money report?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is the last area in which there is untrammelled patronage where a single person who is not answerable to anybody can allocate moneys in the order of £8 million this year rising to £12.24 million next year?  No Minister or Department has discretion to allocate such sums without being subject to competitive tendering, review or analysis.  Bearing in mind the substantial allocations made by the two previous Administrations for the modernisation of the office of the Attorney General, particularly under Mr. Dermot Gleeson, does the Taoiseach agree it is incredible, given modern information technology <Col N="13" /> and the availability of software packages, that the subcosts cannot be separated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the figures can be broken down but to do so one would have to go through every file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 50 per cent has been forecasted.  Can a simple software system be put in place?  Every corner shop which has to deal with the Revenue Commissioners has to do this in respect of VAT returns.  Why is this office exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the matter of including that information in the future.  In my reply I dealt with the situation in the past.  I have already advised the Deputy the reason for the increases. An enormous amount of data is linked directly to the Army deafness cases.  The fees in respect of the finalisation of the McCracken, Moriarty and Flood tribunals have already been included.  The main costs of the McCracken tribunal for 1998 are in respect of parties represented by the tribunal, while the main costs in the Moriarty tribunal are the legal costs paid to counsel for the tribunal.  The Army deafness claims account for the higher figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The allocation in the 1999 Estimates which relates to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is primarily intended to allow for the contingency of the forum having one or more meetings in 1999.  I set out my views on the future of the forum in my reply to a parliamentary question on the subject on 6 October last.</P>
      <P>My Department frequently receives requests for Government support for projects and events of a commemorative nature.  The purpose of the funding provided for under the heading &lsquo;commemoration initiatives&rsquo; is to allow for the possibility of such support in appropriate cases.  This could include support for some residual projects relating to the commemoration of the Famine and 1798.  Additional funding of £200,000 was provided in the budget for commemoration initiatives, including the JFK Trust's Dunbrody Project in 1999.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, advertisements were placed recently in newspapers here, in Northern Ireland and in Britain, inviting applications for projects to be funded under the Act.  Regarding the criteria for allocating funds, I am circulating an information sheet, which is also being sent to those requesting application forms and which sets out the criteria in question.</P>
      <P>There is a specific amount of funding &mdash; £1.49 million &mdash; available in connection with the winding up of the trust.  Approximately £200,000 will be spent in 1998, £800,000 is provided in the Estimate for 1999 and the remainder will be spent in the years immediately following.  The amount in the Estimate for 1999 is a realistic assessment of the expenditure that will occur in 1999, given that, while it is intended to allocate all of the money available early next year, following the completion of the assessment process, it is expected that at least some of the projects will require to be funded in subsequent years.</P>

In regard to Question No. 7, will the Taoiseach indicate why the provision for commemorations has been cut this year from £350,000 last year to £200,000 this year?  With regard to Question No. 8, will the Taoiseach indicate what happened to the £80,000 voted last year for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?

      <P>Social partnership is a dynamic process which must be constantly developed and refined in line with the changing nature of Irish society.  The inclusion, for the first time in the process, of organisations representing the community and voluntary sector was a most positive development.  It represented a tangible acknowledgment of the need to bring the socially excluded and marginalised into the economic and social mainstream.</P>
      <P>The organisations under the community and voluntary pillar have made a significant and unique contribution to the development of Partnership 2000 and, equally important, to its full implementation.  In recognition of that, the Government has responded positively to the NESF report of December last in that the pillar is now represented on the NESC in its own right, as well as the NESF.</P>
      <P>The Government's focus is on fulfilling the present agreement and on putting in place the necessary pathways towards a successor.  On the question of whether representation should be widened in the context of future agreements, the Government will decide on such matters closer to the time when Partnership 2000 is due to expire.</P>

Under Partnership 2000, 18 community and voluntary organisations are represented and they are allocated 12 representatives as part of this pillar. I received many representations from other organisations that were not involved in the last round.  Some representations were made by bodies that are not national bodies and I have ruled out their representation, but some representations <Col N="17" /> were made by national bodies and their inclusion will have to be given consideration.  We should try to keep a handle on the numbers involved, otherwise the process will become too unwieldly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Governments and the parties made a major effort last week to reach agreement on the North-South Implementation Bodies and related matters.  As I indicated last week, I believed that this was within reach and I would have hoped to have been in a position to brief Opposition leaders this week on developments.  In the event, it did not prove possible to bring matters to a definitive conclusion. While this is naturally disappointing, it is not the first time in this process that matters have not gone as well as we would have hoped and we have to simply keep on going until we succeed, just as we did in the negotiations on the British-Irish Agreement.  The people who voted in such overwhelming numbers for the British-Irish Agreement expect nothing less, and that is what we &mdash; the Governments and all the parties &mdash; have to deliver.</P>
      <P>I met the Sinn Féin president, Mr. Gerry Adams, last Friday and the Deputy First Minister Designate, Mr. Seamus Mallon, earlier today.  In both meetings, we reviewed the current situation and the possibilities for making early progress.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I reported on my meetings with Senator George Mitchell and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri last week.</P>
      <P>I will meet bilaterally with Prime Minister Blair at the European Council in Vienna this weekend. In the meantime, as always, we continue to keep in close contact by phone.</P>

      <P>We have to be optimistic.  We have lost a great deal of time.  I had hoped that what happened in the early hours of Thursday morning would be the final arrangement of the position at which we were four weeks ago. Nothing changed until the last minute of the meeting.</P>
      <P>We have lost two months and have not moved an inch in four weeks.  The danger is that we may lose more time.  The perception outside could be that enormous change is taking place.  I want to be constructive but things have not changed in four weeks.  We need to conclude this but, as we lose time, we are not getting down to finalising legislative matters.  Each time we have not reached agreement that work is postponed and the February date becomes difficult.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate thing about next week is that the Assembly is sitting on Monday and Tuesday but the parties will not be back until Sunday night, placing horrendous difficulties in the way of completing this business.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to brief the House on my strategic approach to next week's Fisheries Council.  The negotiations will focus on the setting of total allowable catches and quotas for next year.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has tabled its proposals for 1999 in light of the scientific recommendations, stock assessments and management advice from the ICES Advisory Council on Fisheries Management and the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee.</P>
      <P>The Commission requested the scientists to adopt the precautionary principle in preparing its advice for 1999.  The precautionary approach provides that uncertainty about, or lack of data on, stocks requires very conservative management measures.  The scientific advice for 1999 in relation to a number of fish stocks is extremely pessimistic.  The Commission has generally followed the advice and is proposing significant cuts in the TACs of certain stocks to allow the stocks to recover or, in some cases, to prevent collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The context within which I am working to maximise Irish fishing possibilities next year is therefore very difficult.  We cannot simply ignore the scientific advice.  The fishing industry has been fully briefed on the science and the proposals and I will be working with their support to negotiate the best deal in the circumstances for Irish fishermen in the Council.  My overall objective will be to maximise the fishing possibilities for the Irish fishing industry next year, while ensuring that essential conservation objectives are met through the setting of prudent sustainable TACs which will enable the restoration and viability of stocks.  I will be urging my EU colleagues and the Commission to work to strike the right balance between biological and economic imperatives.  We must secure the future of stocks while providing realistic economic opportunities <Col N="20" /> for the fishing industry next year.  The achievement of balance will be very difficult and the negotiations will be tough and long.</P>
    <P>The agenda for Council will also include the formal signing off on the EU Norwegian fisheries agreement for 1999.  The annual negotiations with Norway concluded last week.  The 1999 overall mackerel TAC remains unchanged at 484,000 tonnes.  This is good news for the Irish pelagic fleet.  In addition, under sustained pressure from the Irish delegate, Norway's share of the blue whiting stocks in western waters has been cut by a further 10,000 tonnes for 1999.  This will give scope for the Irish fleet to continue to develop this promising fishery next year.  We got a good deal for Irish fishermen and the processing industry in these negotiations.  I am glad to say that the industry has generally welcomed the package.</P>
    <P>The Council will also be formally signing off on a number of measures to improve control and enforcement.  The main effect of the measures will be to tighten up on flagship activities, improve monitoring and inspection in the transport and market chain and reinforce co-operation across Europe on control issues.  I believe that these new measures, which I pushed for strongly at the October Council, will help to create the much needed level playing field in the Fisheries Council.</P>
    <P>This will be a very tough Council.  I do not underestimate the difficult challenges of delivering on my objective to maximise sustainable fishing opportunities for 1999 while ensuring the long-term future of fish stocks in our waters.  As I have said, I am liaising very closely with the industry on our negotiating stance.  The House can be assured of my full commitment to getting the best possible deal for the Irish fishing industry next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, in the context of Ireland's position on fisheries, that while we have 16 per cent of European Union waters, 5 per cent of European Union catch levels and under 3 per cent of total tonnage, we are arriving at a situation similar to that of last year where we are considering a reduction in quotas? Would the Minister agree that is a contradiction, on the basis that we are trying to modernise our fishing fleet?</P>
      <P>What hope does the Minister give to those who fish for herring when a major cut in herring stock levels is proposed in the different fishing areas? In other quota species, when the catch level was not reached, they used to swap for other fish.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well at the fisheries negotiation but there is no cause for optimism about the Government's promise in its election manifesto that it would retain existing quotas.  During the election campaign the Minister said he would increase fishing quotas.  I would appreciate if the Minister would give hope to fishermen that the December meeting will come up with something worthwhile for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be difficult discussions, there is no question of that.  It is typical of the December Council, it is like that every year.  On the other hand the European Union is preserving the stocks so we are keeping our fishermen in business.  It may be difficult but the fishermen themselves know the difficulties.  They will be there at the negotiations and they are aware of what the scientific data indicate.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, there have been some improvements.  The annual negotiations with Norway concluded last week and the 1999 overall mackerel TAC remains unchanged at 484,000 tonnes.  This is good news for the Irish pelagic fleet.  In addition, under sustained pressure from the Irish delegate, Norway's share of the blue whiting stocks in western waters has been cut by a further 10,000 tonnes for 1999.  This will give scope to the Irish fleet to continue to develop this promising fishery next year.  We got a good deal for Irish fishermen and the processing industry in these negotiations.  The industry has generally welcomed that package.</P>
      <P>In relation to each of the other quantities, we have a substantial amount of scientific data on the different areas around the coast which we have assessed.  We will be matching our scientific data with that of the European Union and we believe it is not necessary, in our circumstances, to implement the cuts being proposed by the Commission. We will be seeking the retention of the 22,000 tonnes as against the Commission's proposal for 19,000 tonnes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish aquaculture industry has grown exponentially from small beginnings in the early 1980s to a point where currently output of 40,000 tonnes is now worth nearly £60 million per annum.  Aquaculture production world-wide now provides over 25 per cent of global seafood production. This trend is mirrored in Ireland where aquaculture production amounts to some 10 per cent in volume terms and 30 per cent in value terms of our total fish production.  The key commercial species are salmon, trout, mussels and oysters.  Commercialisation of other species is under way.  The potential for further growth, value added and jobs in this sector is considerable and will bring direct benefits to our coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the aquaculture industry is fully supported through the provision of safe and modern landing places at key locations around the coast.  The cost benefit of such investment is self-evident and the economic returns are there for the taking.  I am very pleased to inform the Deputy that I am providing £7.35 million in 1999 for the capital development of major fishery harbours and landing places.  This is a very substantial increase over the funding available in recent years.  I also announced last week, in the context of the budget, the provision of a further additional £3 million specifically earmarked to support small fisheries harbours and aquaculture landing places.  The aquaculture industry and the fishing industry therefore are set <Col N="23" /> to benefit from total investment support in infrastructure of over £10 million next year.  In finalising the prioritised list of projects for the 1999 capital programme, I am inviting the aquaculture industry itself to submit its own assessment and short-list of priorities.  This will help me to ensure that investment is focused on those locations which are a priority in safety and economic terms and will deliver the best economic return for the aquaculture sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information and the news that he is expending £7.35 million on development of piers and harbours plus £3 million on the development of small harbours.</P>
      <P>Given that the aquaculture industry is now worth £60 million to the nation, or 30 per cent in value terms of our total fish production, what plans has the Minister to improve the landing infrastructure in Bantry, the capital of aquaculture? The pier at Bantry is totally inadequate. Will the Minister grant a substantial allocation to upgrade Bantry pier so that it will be able to handle the huge amount of aquaculture development in the bay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Bantry is a very important pier which is very much in need of development.  I met a delegation recently in relation to Bantry.  It is situations like that at Bantry that encouraged me to seek additional funding in the budget.  I was successful for the first time in getting a separate sum for small landing places which will be of particular help to aquaculture.  I am very conscious of the situation at Bantry.  The Deputy has brought it to my attention, as has the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh.  Now that we have the moneys for next year we will be looking as sympathetically as we can at Bantry and other places around the coast. I am very happy that we have an increased allocation of capital and an extra £3 million to help with smaller piers.  The Deputy can feel happy that there is substantial additional funding which will allow us to undertake a number of important projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I previously indicated to the Deputy, it is Government policy to ensure that the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and services and, indeed, Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate in such activities.  In that context, my Department recently wrote to both the Irish Offshore Operators Association and SIPTU urging them to discuss the problem of employment in offshore exploration with the intention of arriving at an acceptable solution.</P>
      <P>The IOOA has now requested a meeting with me in advance of any such discussions and I have agreed to meet them.  This meeting is likely to be followed by a meeting between SIPTU and the IOOA.  I have previously had discussions with SIPTU on this issue and am quite happy to have further such discussions.  I should add that Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration operations. It has been very active in this area for some time and has assisted the operators in identifying Irish companies who can tender for work and assisted companies by identifying opportunities arising in both petroleum exploration and production.</P>

Enterprise Oil is based in Aberdeen.  Is the Minister aware that, not only is Enterprise Oil said to have struck <Col N="25" /> it rich in gas off the coastline, but there are potential inherent dangers for the long-term future of the related services, on the basis of what Enterprise Oil has been allowed to get away with up to now, although I recognise there are restrictions on the Minister?  There is also an extreme danger that it will physically set up in Aberdeen.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister follow the example of his predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who was faced with a similar threat from Enterprise Oil in 1996 when it did not want to operate off the coast of Ireland but had a service base here?  He insisted that it employ the rig operators, which it did.  I am pleased the Minister is having discussions at this stage with Enterprise Oil because if the situation is not satisfactorily resolved we could face a period of discontent on this issue next year.  It is too important an issue to allow it to go in that direction.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy on that.  I regret it happened this year.  The Deputy referred to the previous Minister of State and previous arrangements, but they all predate the EU regulation, which is where the difficulty arises.  Nevertheless, as I have said in the House before, there were Irish workers on the rig.  I saw them when I went to see what was happening on the rig.</P>
      <P>The company was prepared to take on a major contract, valued at £2 million to £3 million with other additional values, from Foynes.  However, that was prevented this year, which was very regrettable.  The effect of that was to drive the explorers to Ayr, where they received services and spent their money instead.  I agree with the Deputy that creates a very dangerous precedent.</P>
      <P>There are three companies involved in this and they have said they are anxious to employ Irish people on the rigs and to get services in Ireland. They are prepared to discuss with SIPTU and me the ways in which this can move forward.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the long-term prospects. It is a different situation from the long-term point of view.  The well this year was a very promising one.  If, as the findings indicate, there is a substantial gas find, there will be new negotiations for the arrangements to bring that onshore.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects to be considered.  It is hoped there will be further appraisal wells next year.  I expect there will be two further appraisal wells to delineate the area.  I hope these discussions will be helpful in that regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm if Statoil has a shareholding in the Enterprise Oil grouping?  Is the Minister aware that Statoil is owned by the Norwegian Government and that it has tremendous respect for the workers in Norway and is subject to many restrictions?  Given that Statoil is part of Enterprise Oil, it would generate a great deal of goodwill if it were to intervene with Enterprise Oil and convince it to use the Irish rig workers and Ireland as a service base.</P>

      <P>Statoil is part of the Enterprise Oil group.  Norway is outside the European Union, which allows Statoil a great deal of freedom and scope in that regard.  However, I hope our discussions will be fruitful.  It was always the position of Enterprise Oil that it would employ people on the rigs continuously; in other words, it would move them to other locations.  The Irish people working on the rigs were moving with the company from the North Sea.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>A report on the investigation of the sinking of the fishing vessel <i>Jenalisa</i>, undertaken by the marine survey office of my Department, has now been finalised and will be published very shortly.</P>
      <P>I will ensure that arrangements are made for each of the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy to be presented with copies of the report in advance of its general release.</P>
      <P>I regret progress in having this and other marine casualty reports published has been slower than I would like.  Accordingly, I have already accepted the general thrust and content of the recently published report of the investigation of marine casualties policy review group, which was set up to review the existing policy, procedures and legislative framework for maritime casualty investigations in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I will bring proposals to Government in the new year to address the recommendations made by the review group.  Work is well under way in my Department on the preparation of the required legislative framework to implement the key proposal, which is the establishment of a new statutory marine casualty investigation board. The board, when established, will have enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to expeditiously publish reports of the board's findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the new system of investigation identified by the review group will resolve the current difficulties regarding the publication of reports and will help me achieve my central aim, which is to establish a modern casualty investigation system, which will have clear procedures and purpose and will meet the needs and expectations <Col N="27" /> of all the various interested parties in relation to such investigations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy said, it was an extraordinary event and it happened only four miles south of Brownstown Head, County Waterford. Tragically none of the crew survived.  Only one body was recovered and the other two men are presumed drowned.</P>
      <P>There is great sensitivity about the publication of reports.  When a report is published it a sensitive and difficult time for everybody concerned. Nevertheless, the families want them to be published. I gave an undertaking in 1992, when I was Minister in this Department for a relatively short time, that reports would be published and a number have been published since then.  I look forward to having the draft legislation early in the new year and to being in a position to put the new proposals and procedures before the House for full discussion.</P>
      <P>I expect the report to be published next week. The procedure in these cases is that the families are fully informed, in advance of publication, of anything in the report which might affect them in any way.  When the report is ready for publication, it is provided in the first instance to the families and, within a couple of days, is made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The principal issue to which the Deputies refer is the implementation in Irish law of the provisions of the 1993 Torremolinos Protocol modifying the 1977 Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels. European Council Directive 97/70/EC on a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres and over in length provides for the implementation by EU member states of the terms of the Torremolinos Protocol.</P>
      <P>The Department has prepared draft regulations to transpose the directive and to give full effect to the provisions of the protocol.  These regulations are currently being settled in the Office of the Attorney General.  I intend to introduce the regulations before the end of this year, as required under the Council directive.</P>
      <P>When the regulations are in place, giving the terms of the Torremolinos Protocol full effect in national law, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the protocol.  I propose to pursue this course of action with the Department of Foreign Affairs which has responsibility for such matters.</P>
      <P>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that fishermen have been saying for some years that the state of the Irish fishing fleet is a disgrace?  It is old and dangerous.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons there is a reluctance on the part of the State to sign the international convention.  Is it not true that the fishing fleet is dangerously substandard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a strong stance on this and have received the support of my Cabinet colleagues to take a number of steps to improve matters. It is true that the fleet, to a large extent, is old.  The average age of the vessels is high.  They do not, therefore, have the most up to date equipment and procedures.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the good response to the white fishing fleet renewal programme.  It was welcomed by both sides of the House, which is only appropriate since it was initiated within the Oireachtas.  It is a particularly important programme. A total of 31 new white fish vessels have been approved.  This will make a huge difference and represents a major upgrading of the fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly, the approvals for modern secondhand vessels, under ten years old, will be issued.  Those vessels will be quite young given the age of the fleet generally.  Approvals for modernisation are also due.  In addition, part of the modernisation package includes a monthly allocation for safety equipment.  That is increasingly being taken up and I urge all fishermen to adopt the safety measures.  There is a 50 per cent grant for safety equipment and there is every opportunity to <Col N="29" /> upgrade vessels and their safety features and standards.</P>
    <P>The safety initiative was slow to take off, apart from in new vessels.  However, when the second-hand and the modernised vessels come on stream, the initiative will be further consolidated.  Furthermore, the addition of safety equipment is now gathering momentum and I expect a greater take up in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing vessels safety review of 1996, which was conducted under the previous Minister, Deputy Barrett, identified 64 per cent of the fleet as having difficulties.  The current Minister's programme for modernisation of older vessels and the provision of new vessels is extremely welcome.  However, given the scale of the difficulties with regard to the safety of vessels, what percentage of the overall fishing fleet will the programme cover?</P>
      <P>In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, the Minister said he would consider allocating funding for the provision of emergency position indicating radio beacons.  What is the position in that regard given the criticisms in the report on the sinking of the <i>Carrickatine</i>?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to criticise the Minister whose new scheme has been well received.  It is an excellent advance on anything proposed in recent years.  However, the problem of old vessels, whose seaworthiness is open to question, has been with us for many years.  In the case of the <i>Jenalisa</i>, it was a rough but not a treacherous day. In recent years, a number of fishing boats have sunk despite the fact that the weather was quite good.  Does the Minister not agree that this is a shocking indictment of the state of the fleet? Earlier this week and in calm weather, a boat which had fouled its propeller with its own nets sank off the west coast, thankfully without loss of <Col N="30" /> life.  That illustrates my point that much of the fleet is dangerously substandard.</P>
      <P>Last week Deputy Finucane published a Bill which seeks to put greater controls on maritime activities in the interest of safety.  Will the Government support that Bill and provide Government time for it to be debated in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the schemes in general and sea worthiness, all vessels are required to undergo an examination every 12 &mdash; or it may be 14 &mdash; months.  Regular checks which are very important are carried out by the Marine Survey Office.  I agree that sea worthiness is crucial and essential for crews on vessels.</P>
      <P>The issue of how boats get into difficulties is in some ways separate.  As the Deputy mentioned, nets can foul on a high sea and it becomes necessary to let them go very quickly.  If this is not done fast enough the vessel may get into difficulty.  The stability of boats in these circumstances is being considered arising out of the investigations on the sinking of vessels.  I am very concerned that some of the best modern boats have sunk.  In so far as they can, the reports will lay out the circumstances in which this happens.  In other cases vessels vanish without trace and cannot be found which means there is no chance of getting information about what happened, other than that communicated in advance.</P>
      <P>It is a dangerous livelihood and every precaution must be taken, particularly in terms of mechanics, which seems to be one of the main causes of accidents and difficulties.  I accept that more attention will have to be given to the matter.</P>
      <P>In terms of jet skis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform Deputies that the 1999 Estimates provide for significantly increased funding for coast protection works.  The amount I have allocated for coast protection projects in 1999 is £3.74 million.  This is a fourfold increase over the annual level of funding to date.  I have asked the Department to draw up a prioritised programme of works for which financial support will be made available in 1999 in light of the very many proposals for coast protection schemes received from local authorities.</P>
      <P>In County Wicklow, phase 1 of the Bray coast protection scheme will be completed next year.  I am consulting closely with Bray Urban District Council and all relevant interests in relation to scoping the further works required to provide the necessary definitive level of protection at Bray. Other proposals for coast protection works in County Wicklow and around the country will be considered in the context of prioritising projects under the 1999 programme.</P>
      <P>For the longer term, we need a comprehensive national strategy for tackling coastal erosion.  This will entail clear and systematic identification and prioritisation of coast protection needs and the appropriate means of responding to specific problems. I will be pursuing the development of this strategy in consultation with ministerial colleagues over the coming months.  I am also seeking in the next round of Structural Funds a level of funding for coast protection commensurate with the very serious problems which we face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fourfold increase in the allocation.  However, I am sure the Minister will agree that it is insufficient to address even the tip of the iceberg in terms of coastal erosion and that this problem is assuming very critical proportions in parts of the country.  A number of years ago I remember every local authority with responsibility for a coast was asked to submit a number of priority areas &mdash; I think it was four or five &mdash; within their area of responsibility.  These beaches have already been identified by the local authorities and were submitted to the Department three years ago, therefore a priority list exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> When does the Minister expect to be able to address the problems in the areas on the lists submitted? How much will this cost?  Instead of £3.74 million, £347 million would be necessary to make an impression on the difficulties that exist.  In County Donegal the areas that need attention include Magheraroarty, Portnew and Muirveagh. These areas were included on the list submitted four years ago and little or nothing has happened yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Costings and figures were done by local authorities and the cost of addressing the needs of the priority areas which were submitted came to £35 million.  It was not expected that all these areas would be addressed in one year.  The priority areas were spread around the country and, in the case of Donegal County Council, included Ramelton, Lisfannon, Millbay, Magheraroarty, Teelin, Mountcharles, White Strand, Inver and Shore Road, Bundoran.  I will examine these areas in the context of the money available to see what can be done.  There are areas in very serious need of attention, such as Quilty in County Clare and Bray where the situation is particularly serious.</P>
      <P>The results of research show the problem in terms of sea level rises.  It is estimated that the global mean sea level has risen by between 100 millimetres and 250 millimetres in the past 100 years.  The average rise is between one and 2.55 millimetres per year.  Donegal is very fortunate as the level is rising rather than falling, though some problems still exist.  It is Deputy Sheehan's area which is falling.</P>
      <P>Land movements arising primarily from postglacial adjustments complicate the extraction of this data from tide gauge records.  Analysis of recorded data from five tide gauges around the Irish coast yield the following results.  The sea level in Dublin increased by 0.3 millimetres per year.  In Courtown in County Wexford it increased by 0.54 and by 1.58 at Castletownshend in County Cork.  It decreased at Malin Head in County Donegal by 2.4 and increased at Ballycastle in County Antrim by 0.64.</P>
      <P>The sea level fall at Malin Head was attributed to a local land rise recovery from glacial loading. We are moving up slowly.  If people feel they have a rise in the morning, that is where it is coming from.  Fortunately it is very small and will not affect people too much.  Global warming is expected to lead to a rise in the mean sea level as a result of thermal expansion of the oceans and melting glaciers and ice sheets.  Deputy Sheehan is having more difficulty in that regard.</P>

      <P>Erosion is a particular problem with the soft coastline &mdash; there are sandy beaches, sand dunes and clay cliffs.  There is a great deal of work to be done here, as I said when examining the local authorities' submissions.  The Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-9 provided £5 million over five years; it amounted to slightly less than £1 million per year. We can now go a good deal further.  The 1993 amount was £100,000, so the £3.74 million can be seen as a substantial change in that.  We will look for EU funds from the next package to enhance that.  It means that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The global market situation for herring and mackerel is currently very worrying. The crisis is due to the collapse of the Russian economy coupled with the economic recession in Japan.  Japan is a key market for mackerel and herring and has been a major importer of produce from Europe with related demand for Irish products, notably herring roe.  In more recent years, the Russian and other CIS States were significant buyers of mackerel and herring.  The heavy demand resulted in historically high prices for mackerel on European markets in the past two years which was reflected in significant sales abroad by Irish mackerel fishermen and processors.</P>
      <P>However, the Russian economic collapse has resulted in a major price reversal in the past four months.  I hope to see some improvement in mackerel prices in early 1999.  In the meantime, my Department and BIM are working closely with the Irish fish processors and exporters to maximise all possible market openings for Irish herring and mackerel, notably in Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on the Management and Marketing of Herring recommended a series of measures to maintain and enhance the Irish herring exports in the very difficult global environment. All of these recommendations are being implemented, including quality development programmes for the fleet and herring processors, an industry marketing group, market research and new product development.  These initiatives will help the industry through the present difficult market situation and position it well for development in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present scenario the Department is also working with the industry to ensure use is made <Col N="35" /> as appropriate of the existing EU market support schemes.  The schemes allow for withdrawal of herring and mackerel from the market when the minimum withdrawal price for sale is not reached and the payment of a subsidy where product is held over with a view to reintroducing it to the market at a later stage.</P>
    <P>These are difficult times on the pelagic market front and the difficulties are due primarily to external factors over which we have no control. In that difficult scenario the focus will continue to be on developing new market opportunities and maximising quality and competitiveness to deliver best possible prices for Irish product.  I also stress the need for greater co-operation between the catching and processing sectors of the Irish pelagic industry to ensure that supply and demand is in synergy and works to national economic advantage.  That co-operation is vital to maintaining jobs and exports in the Irish pelagic sector.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of just how bad is the situation he presides over?  Is he aware that there was more than 700 tonnes of mackerel for sale in Killybegs last week and only 20 tonnes were sold?  Is he aware that the price has collapsed from £400 to £500 per tonne down to a position where it hardly makes the intervention price of £123?  Is he aware that herring, which was making £400 per tonne five years ago, is not making the intervention price of £123 either?  Is he not ashamed to preside over this situation as Minister?  The prime product of our seas is resulting in our fishermen being next door to bankruptcy as a result of the collapse in prices. What will he do about it?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the major markets are depressed. At the March fisheries council meeting I was successful in reducing the quantity of herring that could be imported tariff free this year to the Community, which was a strong recommendation of the task force.  That is one thing I have done. I also made my position on free quantity clear at the October meeting, and I will continue to campaign against any move to introduce such a measure at the December meeting.  The abolition of free quotas for herring is our objective, because at a time when the markets are so difficult, there should not be free outside quotas without duty.  Those are some of the steps, but one of <Col N="36" /> the main ones is to improve quality.  Fishermen are participating in measures in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney) Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the four questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already expressed my concern at the manner in which Fruit of the Loom has announced the temporary lay-off of the majority of its staff at its plants in Donegal this week.  The company's announcement yesterday regarding a temporary lay-off to take effect before the Christmas break from Friday, 11 December until full-time work resumes in early January 1999 came as a major surprise to both me and the IDA. Neither the IDA or I had been consulted in the <Col N="37" /> matter.  However, I understand rumours were circulating in Donegal last weekend about such an announcement.</P>
    <P>Since I took up office I have been concerned about the threat to the maintenance of the tee-shirt sewing jobs in Donegal.  I met the chairman of the company on five occasions to discuss its future plans. The company made me aware of the international market pressure its tee-shirt sewing operations were under and its options to transfer production from Donegal to Morocco where labour costs are 15 per cent of those in Ireland.  The company consistently maintained that, with the exception of the position in Dungloe, there would be no redundancies before the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>Since September, the IDA has been engaged in protracted discussions with the company in an effort to safeguard jobs and resolve all issues relating to grant liabilities arising from prospective job reductions.  The IDA board will review the outcome of the negotiations with the company at its monthly meeting tomorrow.  I hope that after the meeting the company will make a statement on both its short-term and long-term plans for its future operations in Donegal.  On 16 September I established the Donegal initiative which it is intended will focus the efforts of the development agencies upon improving the county's capacity to generate jobs and attract foreign investment.  Over the past three months the IDA has conducted more than eight promotional itineraries to Donegal.  I have kept in close touch with the progress of the work of the initiative and I met the chairman in Letterkenny during the past fortnight to discuss developments.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an announcement from the company following the outcome of the negotiations involving the IDA tomorrow.  Through such an announcement the company can begin to deal in an open and frank manner with its workforce. It should also help to trigger the range of support services which have been held in waiting pending clarification of the company's intentions. I will meet a delegation from the trade unions this evening to discuss the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the early warning system within the IDA and the Minister's Department regarding possible job losses, will she explain why she is so surprised about this information and why she did not have it before she heard it yesterday afternoon, when rumours were circulating?  Will she make an unequivocal and clear statement as to the number of jobs threatened in this company and how many will be lost in the first quarter of next year?  Will she confirm what the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, said on a radio programme this morning, which was that there will be only 1,200 jobs in the future life of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I entered the Department at the end of June 1997, Fruit of the Loom was on early warning notice and that is why I have given <Col N="38" /> it so much attention.  The tee-shirt operation has been under pressure, in particular, since the company began to face stiff competition from low cost economies such as MorocCo. I do not know why the company did not tell me, the IDA or my Department that it was going to announce lay offs yesterday.  I understand a member of management in Donegal informed one of the unions over the weekend but the IDA and the Department were not told.  I only became aware of it, notwithstanding what has been said, yesterday morning.</P>
      <P>With regard to the company's operations in Donegal, all my efforts, and those of the IDA and my predecessor, have been directed to maintaining as many jobs as possible in Donegal.  We remain extremely concerned about the tee-shirt jobs.  If tee-shirts can be made for 15 per cent of the cost in Morocco, then it is obvious what are the consequences of that.</P>
      <P>However, I am also concerned about the other jobs and that is what we have been discussing since last September.  There are issues involving grant liability.  The more jobs maintained by Fruit of the Loom, the less grant money it will have to repay while the more jobs it takes out of Donegal, the more grant money it will have to repay.  That is why the grant issue in addition to the responsibilities to the taxpayer and the Exchequer is crucial.</P>
      <P>The IDA will report tomorrow at its board meeting and I hope after the meeting the company will, as is usual in these situations, discuss the matter with its workforce and the trade union movement.  If that is not the case, we intend to make the workers and their representatives aware of the agreement that has been reached with the IDA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The tee-shirt jobs in Fruit of the Loom post-Christmas are very vulnerable.  That amounts to between 700 and 800 indirect and direct jobs.  However, there are many other jobs. In addition to this closure, the company is also closing its operations in Northern Ireland and Morocco, where 850 people will be let go on Friday for three weeks.  This does not just involve Donegal.  All of the company's operations in Northern Ireland and Morocco will be closed for three months because it has told us it is at over capacity currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to communicate my understanding to the many families affected in Donegal.  Does the Minister accept that the uncertainty about the future of this company in Ireland is seriously aggravating the plight of the workers concerned?  Surely I can presume she knows the elements of the IDA package at this stage.  Is she or any of her agents talking directly to the rapacious senior management of this company? <Col N="39" /> In particular is she talking to that awful fellow, Farrelly?  If she is, can she tell the workers what are the elements of the IDA package and how many people are confronted with the inevitability of redundancy in the new year?  In so far as she can foresee, how many workers will be retained in employment?  What infrastructure is she preparing to put in place to support the workers who face the prospect of redundancy?  Is the IDA giving her any advice in terms of the adaptability of that plant for other types of employment in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any discussions with Mr. Farrelly since meeting him at the end of September.  The outcome of that meeting is well known &mdash; we sought to bring clarity to the matter because there were major differences between both sides about grant liability.  After that meeting the IDA went into discussions and we offered independent legal advice to both sides but the company did not avail of it.  In any event there is now clarity about these matters and they are no longer at issue.  At the September meeting I felt it incumbent on me, on behalf of the workers and the Exchequer, to make the company aware of its obligations, which are underpinned legally.</P>
      <P>I know the elements of the package going before the IDA board tomorrow but I do not feel at liberty to reveal them.  I am not involved in negotiating these packages, nor am I involved in the exit.  Given the position last September and all the circumstances, I believe the IDA has negotiated a successful package from the point of view of many of the workers.  I hope the elements of the package can be in the public domain late tomorrow afternoon.  It would be my intention in any event &mdash; because I believe it to be my responsibility to do so &mdash; to make the workers, Deputies and the public aware of what the future holds for the workers in Donegal.</P>
      <P>As to alternatives, FÁS has carried out a skills assessment of the Dungloe workers who have been made redundant.  About 56 per cent of them want to attend a return to work course, and we will establish a customised course in the area.  We intend to do that for all the other workers who might be made redundant, but clearly we cannot do so until after they are let go.</P>
      <P>As to alternative investment, the IDA has brought eight groups on promotional trips to Donegal and in the present buoyant circumstances for inward investment we are optimistic that we will succeed in finding alternatives.  I cannot be certain that the skills of the Fruit of the Loom workforce would be suitable to all the new investment but the aim would be to get investment to match the skills or to get the workers to meet the needs of any inward investment which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this company has acted disgracefully in relation to this <Col N="40" /> problem since mid-summer, and has acted cruelly towards its workers in Donegal?  It has been like Chinese water torture, administered on a drip by drip basis since last summer, and the company has not come clean with the workers yet.  Does she agree the company has not done properly by the people who gave it such loyal and dedicated service?</P>
      <P>We are told there may be 700 to 800 redundancies shortly.  Could the Minister guarantee this will be the extent of the redundancies, or is it merely the tip of the iceberg, and before the end of 1999 Fruit of the Loom could have fewer than 1,000 workers in Donegal &mdash; in other words, up to 1,500 jobs could be lost?</P>
      <P>What is to happen to the satellite factories outside Buncrana, in Milford, Malin Head and Raphoe?  Will they open their doors in 1999, bearing in mind that Dungloe is already closed? Though that factory has been shut for a fortnight, redundancy terms have not yet been agreed with the workers who have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>Given that the vast majority of Fruit of the Loom workers are young people in their twenties and thirties, many of whom went straight from school to industry and have no other training or work experience, what programme of retraining is envisaged or is being established?  When will it commence, to whom will it be available, who will administer it, and who will be called to it, so that these workers can be retrained to take up a position in another industry which may be located in Donegal in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right about the Dungloe facility.  Redundancy terms have not been arranged with the trade union movement and the matter is currently before the Labour Court.  Retraining will be done by FÁS under the auspices of the Donegal Initiative; FÁS will need outside assistance but that will be made available. It will follow the same course as the operation for the Dungloe redundancies.  People will not be interviewed by FÁS until we are certain who will be made redundant.</P>
      <P>It would be better if things had been dealt with differently.  This is a loyal workforce, many of whom have not worked anywhere other than in Fruit of the Loom.  Some are young, others are middle aged, and many wonder whether they will get another job; they are deeply worried and very angry.  Last September we hoped clarity could be brought to the matter.  There have been changes to the company since I became Minister 18 months ago &mdash; the current manager of the Donegal operation is the third in that time.  Mr. Willie McCarter and his successor, Mr. Andy McCarter, no longer manage the operation.  Until yesterday morning, some of the local management in Donegal were not aware of what was to happen on Friday, which is highly unusual to say the least and not helpful in present circumstances.  I hope a new position will emerge tomorrow and the company will be more open and frank with its workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> As to redundancies, there is no question Fruit of the Loom is in big trouble &mdash; last year it lost $488 million, it has shed thousands of jobs in the USA and moved to low cost countries in the Caribbean and to MexiCo. It is under intense pressure in Europe because demand for its products, and products in that market generally, has declined. However, I believe that during 1999 there will be in excess of the number of workers mentioned by the Deputy in Fruit of the Loom in Donegal.  The nature of the agreement, if approved by the IDA board, ensures there are guarantees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the nature of the package, as I said earlier.  I would like to be more helpful but we are involved in negotiations and the package must be approved by the board of the IDA, which has sole discretion in this matter to negotiate agreements and exits of this kind with companies. I believe in all the circumstances it has negotiated a satisfactory package from the point of view of the workers, Donegal and the taxpayer, although we wish it was a different package.  It is the intention that the elements will be clear from tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am coming to it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Mr. Maloney contacted the Minister about the fears of these 2,000 people and the dire future they now face.  In relation to the Donegal Initiative and the moves to find successor industries, will the Minister be visiting the workforce in the coming days?  Will there be a variety of replacement industries for the region? Given that the chief executive of the company was a difficult operator, as Deputy Rabbitte said, it was the Minister's job to keep in close contact with senior management in Fruit of the Loom. When was the last time she had such contact?</P>
      <P>A number of years ago the Minister for the Environment provided £25 million for a water supply system specifically for the company.  How will that investment be used in the future?  Can the Minister assure the House it will be used for successor jobs?</P>

      <P>I was not involved in the events in recent weeks because they were tied down in negotiations.  Ministers do not negotiate these deals or exits from them with companies.  It is also very much related to legal interpretation.  It would not have been appropriate for me to be involved.</P>
      <P>When I met Mr. Farrelly last, I made it clear to him that I would not ask the IDA to renege on the money taxpayers invested in the company through grant aid.  I said I expected all legal obligations to be met and that I would not put any pressure on the IDA because that would be inappropriate. Enormous amounts of money were provided to support this operation.  By and large, we have received good value for the money through good employment in Donegal.  At its peak, 2,700 people were employed.  When Fruit of the Loom took over the McCarter operation in 1986, it involved a total investment of £130 million, which was the biggest ever investment in such a region.  For many years, it generated much employment and I hope it will continue to give good employment in future.</P>
      <P>In relation to alternative uses of the facilities, many of them will be very marketable in the current circumstances.  The IDA is optimistic that once it knows the exact situation, it will be in a position to market any facilities which might be vacated by Fruit of the Loom.  However, one does not begin to market facilities unless they become vacant.</P>
      <P>Nobody has visited workers who are being made redundant more often than me.  I understand one of my predecessors as Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; that he often told me how foolish I was to do so.</P>

I was in County Donegal ten days ago and I met the Donegal initiative.

      <P>Given the rumours circulating since September, does the Tánaiste agree that the hardworking and loyal workforce of Fruit of the Loom has been badly treated by its employer?  For example, the shocking announcement yesterday was debated in the media while senior management figures were kept in the dark. I was in contact with a senior management person during the day and senior management did not have any information on the exact position until a late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The Tánaiste understands the serious consequences of any job losses in the unemployment blackspot in which I live.  Will she give an assurance that she will continue to give every assistance to the task force which has been established and encourage its work?  I understand it is doing tremendous work behind the scenes and I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on establishing it.</P>
    <P>Given that most of the workers will go on enforced early Christmas leave, will the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirm that they will be given concrete information on their futures before they go?  In the event of job losses, will she confirm that the affected areas of Inishowen and north Donegal will be considered as a priority one job creation zone by Government and State agencies?  This has not been apparent in statistics to date.</P>

Virtually every week there has been a new rumour about Fruit of the Loom.  At this stage, the workers wonder what to believe.  I hope tomorrow they will know their future with certainty. It would be unsatisfactory when the lay offs occur on Friday if people did not know what their future entailed.</P>
      <P>In relation to alternative industry, we are concerned to ensure that all the Fruit of the Loom facilities which might be made available are marketed. Deputy Keaveney is particularly concerned about the Malin Head facilities which will be among the most difficult to market because of their location.

      <P>In relation to grant aid, various packages were negotiated at different times. Different amounts will be repayable, depending on the number of jobs which go and when they go.  Some of the grant liability runs out at the end of 1999 while more does not run out until later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in September that if the entire operation went the amount which would have to be repaid would be almost £12 million.  I do not have to hand the figure regarding the total amount of money the company received, but it was in the region of £20 million.  It received approval for much more on the basis that 4,000 jobs would be created.  However, due to changes in the market and the company's position, that did not become a reality.  It only received money as jobs were created.  These jobs must be sustained for a period, otherwise the grant must be repaid.  This is tied down legally.  The legal agreements will be honoured.</P>

      <P>I confirm that the main mischief maker with regard to Packard Electric was a different Mary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Tánaiste have a figure on file regarding the total grant aid investment over approximately <Col N="45" /> ten years in this group of companies?  Has the difficulty which she experienced in extracting information from the company, even up to the last minute, changed her attitude and that of her Department towards the directive on consultation and the European social model in general?</P>
    <P>Will she tell the House about the composition of the Donegal initiative?  Does she accept, for example, in the cases of Digital and Packard Electric that the models operated were successful? Has she noticed that more recent versions of the task force idea have been deprived of outside persons as the driving force?  Does she agree with my humble opinion that the Packard Electric task force was successful because outside persons were the driving force and the agencies provided expert and conscientious back up?  I am not reflecting on any of the people around the Tánaiste or the expertise in the agencies, but there is a wish to ringfence it in the family.  The result will be &mdash; Deputy Keaveney should note this &mdash; when recommendations are agreed to regenerate the situation in Donegal there will not be the capacity to go to Cabinet to find the wherewithal to support those recommendations. It is not a good idea that it ought to be ringfenced to the family, which is the pattern in any area one wishes to choose with the Government.  For example, the National Crime Forum report was published today by members of the permanent Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the grant aid figures with me but if my memory serves me correctly, in the region of £20 million to £21 million was drawn down by the company during the past decade or so.  The nature and make-up of task forces vary.  In the Seagate task force many outside business people were involved, as in the Tallaght task force established by the Deputy when Minister of State.  The same applies in Donegal.  For some of the smaller operations it is not always practicable to have outside people.  We have a number of these throughout the country and they put enormous pressure on the agencies.  The IDA has a staff of only 240 worldwide and is a relatively small organisation, albeit an efficient one.  The Donegal task force, which is chaired by Michael McLoone, the county manager, comprises several local business people, a member of IFI, the former director general of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Kevin Bonner, an assistant secretary from the Department and many other representatives from the workers and the various agencies.  It is similar to the Tallaght model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that Fruit of the Loom would not be here if the directive on consultation was in force. Neither would it have influenced the decision whether to go or stay.  Even if it were in force it may not necessarily have changed the manner in which this company, or one particular person in it, might have handled the matter.  The manner in which workers learned about their future is <Col N="46" /> unusual.  That has not happened with any of the other companies we have dealt with recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister adopt a hands-on approach to this matter in the days and weeks ahead and maintain continuous contact with the IDA which appears to be the only organisation that has any communication with Fruit of the Loom?  What is the immediate future for the 2,300 Donegal people who will be without a job from next Monday and what arrangements are being made to ensure they and their families will be able to get through the Christmas season in a comfortable and reasonable way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy an assurance I will adopt a hands-on approach in so far as I can to the matters surrounding Fruit of the Loom.  No company has taken up more of my time in the past year than this company.  Clearly those workers who will be laid off on Friday are entitled to whatever welfare services are available in the normal way.  Given that they are not being made redundant we cannot get involved in training programmes until the new year.  As soon as it becomes clear who is being made redundant and when, the facilities being made available to the Dungloe workers will be made available as quickly as possible to these workers also.</P>

      <P>On the basis of information previously provided in reply to a number of Dáil questions, Deputies will be aware there is a contractual agreement with Esat Digifone which was signed by the previous Government on 25 June 1997, allowing it to install mobile telephony equipment at specified Garda stations, subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include a requirement that Esat Digifone comply fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>

      <P>If Radio Teilifís Rabbitte would allow me the opportunity to proceed I will do so.  The Garda authorities consider that this arrangement provides benefits in terms of their own plans for the future development of their radio and telecommunications network.

Under the agreement, access to Garda sites is subject to Digifone complying fully with all planning requirements and health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that Esat Digifone had made two previous attempts to install its equipment at Kerrykeel prior to last Wednesday.  On 10 September work was called off because ESB cables making access to the site dangerous had not been removed.  Apparently there were 12 gardaí and about 30 protesters present on that occasion.  On 1 October a second attempt to install the equipment was called off because of concerns about a possible breach of the peace.  There were, I understand, 40 gardaí and about 70 protesters present on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday morning last I was asked if I would contact Deputy Harry Blaney who was very concerned about actions which were under way to erect a new mast and install Esat antennae at Kerrykeel Garda station.  When I contacted Deputy Blaney he explained a large number of gardaí had arrived in Kerrykeel to ensure that the erection of a Garda mast and antennae would proceed that day.  A number of local residents, including women and children, were present, <Col N="48" /> intending to resist.  There was considerable agitation and clearly there was a reason for this. Deputy Blaney requested that the matter be resolved and said he did not propose to attend the Dáil that day unless he had an assurance that the erection of the mast and antennae would not proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Deputy I would make inquiries straight away and come back to him because conflict seemed likely in which women and children would have been involved.  I contacted the Secretary General of my Department and asked him to convey my concerns to the Garda Commissioner and my view that action on the erection of the mast and antennae should be halted.  The Secretary General told me that the controversy at Kerrykeel was the focus of major attention on an RTE radio programme as we spoke, that suggestions had been made that women and children were forming part of the line of resistance and that allegations had been made by a local woman that she and other women had been pushed aside and injured by the gardaí.  I emphasise this was a suggestion which had been made on radio, not something on which I had any other evidence.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General then spoke to the Garda Commissioner who was aware of the controversy and was himself trying to assemble precise information about developments at Kerrykeel.  The Secretary General conveyed to the Commissioner my concerns that the work at Kerrykeel should be halted.  The end result was that there was local agreement about the erection of the Garda mast, which is essential for the maintenance of effective Garda communications, but the installation of the Esat antennae did not proceed.  Deputy Blaney asked me to assure him in writing that the installation of the antennae would never proceed and I informed him that while I was prepared to take that position, I could not offer any guarantees in writing as other parties to the contract had contractual rights and would naturally have to be consulted.</P>
      <P>Consultations are taking place today between my Department and Esat Digifone and as the matters at hand relate to a commercial contract &mdash; agreed by my predecessor which continues to be binding on me &mdash; involving the State and other parties, I do not believe it would be appropriate to speculate at this stage on the likely outcome of these discussions.</P>

I have had representations from public representatives, including <Col N="49" /> Opposition Deputies, about the installation of Esat masts in other locations.  In view of the particular circumstances applying to the situation at Maam, it was agreed that the erection of a Garda mast would proceed but that the installation of the Esat antennae would be postponed pending further discussion.</P>
      <P>In my view, there was ample justification for intervention in the case of Kerrykeel against a background in which a potential for serious conflict existed.

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Is the Minister aware he has created a very serious situation?  He has effectively set a precedent that operations must stop if there is a prospect of a public protest.  Does the Minister recall informing this House on 25 June last that under the terms of the contract concluded with Esat Digifone, he was not at liberty to refuse the company access to Garda sites except for a contravention by the company of any of the conditions associated with such access? There were no ifs, buts or maybes in that.  Why did the Minister decide to personally intervene in this instance to have the Garda forces withdrawn? What exactly did the Minister tell the Secretary General of his Department to tell the Garda Commissioner?  Is the Minister aware that a committee of this House, chaired by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, has in its possession an expert report giving a clean bill of health to such masts.  I understand this information was conveyed to the Minister in no uncertain terms.  What assurances has the Minister given to other Independent Members on the erection of masts?  If he continues to capitulate to Independent Members on this and other issues, he is effectively handing over the reins of office to them.  He should pack his bags and get out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the original spin and gloss the Government put on the budget has given way to a calmer and cooler assessment of exactly what were its provisions.  A general requirement of people is that we should sustain the economic boom that has given the Minister for Finance consecutive chances to hand out money.  We have had record growth in the economy of 50 per cent over the past five years.  If we are to sustain this boom and not move from boom to bust, we must look at the capacity issues of the economy.  If we look at capacity issues we will see severe problems ahead.</P>
      <P>There are capacity problems in relation to housing where there is a clear imbalance between supply and demand.  We need an extra 45,000 houses a year, yet the Government has not made available the developmental sanitary services, water and so on to ensure that amount of accommodation construction can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another area of infrastructural development, such as public transport &mdash; we are having a debate later in this House on that very matter &mdash; it is clearly established everywhere in Europe that a train carrying 500 people or a bus carrying 80 people is far more efficient than a lane of cars and we do not have the investment in this budget, in the public capital programme in the Book of Estimates to bring that about.  We will not therefore be able to sustain a situation where the Minister <Col N="69" /> had almost £1,000 per worker to give away and yet we are assuming that the boom will continue.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in the Asian and Russian economies and, latterly in the UK economy, which is clearly stagnant, we are facing, as the ERSI prophesied, a clear economic slowdown with, in particular, tapering of investment. This budget fails to meet the major over-riding macroeconomic objective of sustaining this boom.</P>
    <P>Turning to some specific issues of deep concern in this budget by far the most disappointing area is that of child care.  Child care is an essential component of public policy in relation to an expanding workforce.  We have 95,000 more people at work today than we had this time last year.  If we are to continue to grow the workforce, we are not only dependent on school leavers and returned emigrants but on mothers returning to the workforce.  There was an expectation after the establishment of the expert group that this budget would start to address for the first time the specialist needs relating to child care.  The agenda of what is required was very clear.  First, it is children under five years of age who are not at school that require special attention.  A reasonable expectation was that child benefit for children from zero to five years of age would have been doubled.  However, the increase has been deferred to 1 September, virtually the latter end of 1999, and the increase works out at a paltry 69p per week.  That would not pay for a cup of coffee for the childminder, let alone for a proper childminding service.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that this issue is not new because the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1977 specifically promised £2,000 worth of tax relief at the standard rate, and nothing has been provided in two budgets in that regard. Even the most modest request of £5 million to develop cre che facilities has been abandoned, and that in no way creates a conflict between women working in the home and women in the workplace. There is a need to deal with that issue, not only in the interests of the needs of mothers and children, but in light of the need for an expanding workforce.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that steps have been taken on tax reform and in relation to the low paid. However, I have an anecdote which illustrates a big concern.  It concerns a man, 38 years of age, who had worked all his life and who has now been diagnosed with a particular form of cancer which I hope can be cured.  He has found himself on disability benefit.  He gets no pay related benefit, nor does he get any tax refund.  He has four children.  He finds now that he will get an increase of £5 next June on his social welfare payment.  He does not get one penny for his children.  Whether he has no children or four children, he gets the same rate of increase.  How can he be expected to pay his mortgage and everything else out of £138 a week?  This man never thought he would be idle.  He is not in the long-term unemployed category &mdash; there is no question of incentive to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> The fact there was not a penny increase in child dependant allowance payments for anybody on social welfare indicates that a new poverty is developing.  We are talking about people who are paying their taxes, PAYE and PRSI and they are finding it very difficult to manage.  A trade-off was always acknowledged &mdash; if child dependant allowance payments for social welfare for adults were not paid, the child benefit would match it. This has not happened.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the health service.  For the people who do not have a medical card, every day is a budget day on health. The Minister for Health and Children has announced that inpatient hospital charges to BUPA and VHI are to go up by 9 per cent.  The VHI and BUPA have deferred an increase in premia, but it may be higher than 9 per cent.  We have had a radical change in the drugs refund scheme in terms of the thresholds and the amalgamation of the two schemes.  For someone who could be a pensioner, someone who does not have a medical card, the benefits of the budget have been completely eroded by virtue of the changes to the drugs refund scheme and the increases in private health assurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Last year in the budget there was a fanfare about £12 million to deal with waiting lists and a special initiative this year, £8 million, but 100,000 bed nights were lost to the system and waiting lists lengthened by over 10,000.  Those waiting lists however, do not reveal the biggest element of the waiting lists.  A man came to my clinic this weekend who is waiting for a hip operation.  He has had his X-rays and been referred by his GP but he must wait until next August to see the consultant. He is not on the waiting list because he will not be formally put on it until next August. There is a layer of people who are waiting to go on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that no initiative was put in place for first time home buyers, such as exempting the first £100,000 of the purchase of a second hand house from stamp duty and developing the sanitary service capital budget.  Nothing has been put in place for first time home buyers, who are also the people with the child care problems to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>When Nigel Lawson was the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer the people were rolling in the aisles of buoyancy after his budgets.  However, that boom was followed by negative equity, high unemployment, higher inflation and depression.  I fear all the signals are there that we will follow the same route.  Having given so much money back in reduced taxes and pumped so much money into the economy, the Minister did nothing to stimulate consumption which would not result in more foreign holidays, more imported cars and more imported brown goods which are giving wealth to other economies and taking it out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken an imaginative step in relation to pension provision.  The rate of <Col N="71" /> return for people making private provision for pensions, which has been limited to 15 per cent of salary heretofore, is low because of low interest rates.  That should be radically altered so that anyone can top up their pension and get tax relief for so doing.</P>
    <P>The Government should now make a decision in regard to the sale of shares.  The bulk, 50.1 per cent, of Telecom Éireann is to be sold by an IPO in the middle of next year.  There is no prospect of retailing those shares.  Instead of selling them to institutions in the US and elsewhere, we should be trying to soak up that consumption by ensuring the ordinary Telecom Éireann subscriber has an opportunity to buy those shares.  There are no proposals in this budget to deliberately try to soak up the extra consumption which has been generated.</P>
    <P>The budget does not address the four crucial needs in the economy.  The first is the need to deal with our infrastructural situation.  That means developing a modern transport network, in the form of Luas, upgrading our railways and providing, in the short-term, a proper city bus service. There is no strategic approach by the Minister for Public Enterprise to doing that; instead, we have <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal responses.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt to deal with the housing crisis.  There are 45,000 applicants for local authority housing.  We used to build 1,700 houses a year in Dublin and this year we will build 230.  The figures speak for themselves. There is no proposal to deal with the high property and site prices and to address the Dublin housing situation.  Therefore, the homeless, those in the rental sector and all those down the line will suffer.  The Government has no real agenda for public housing and transport, which are medium term issues requiring sustained resolution, capital investment, planning and a commercial focus.</P>
    <P>We must break the cycle of disadvantage, by which I mean the 16 per cent of people who leave school with no useful qualification.  It is interesting to note the ESRI projections for future labour requirements up to 2010, from which it is quite clear there will be less demand for unskilled manual labour and more demand for people with qualifications.  The only way to break the cycle is to ensure that 100 per cent of children, if possible, stay at school longer, go on to third level and can read and write.  That means making fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>The OECD report said we have the highest rate of adult illiteracy in Europe.  We have heard anecdotes about people who cannot read prescriptions, medicine bottle labels and so on.  We have over 500 schools with average class sizes of more than 30 pupils.  That situation does not require an incremental approach but a fundamental sustained attack, particularly at a time when the school going population is declining by a quarter because of the demographic changes and when the money is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> There is no overarching strategy to deal with the health waiting lists, the perpetuation of the cycle of disadvantage through education and the new poverty constituency which is developing, particularly among those who are sick.  The high paid benefited from last year's budget and the low paid have benefited from this year's.  There is no sustaining strategy for either infrastructure or social need.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to take the earliest possible opportunity to clarify the situation in regard to the urban renewal scheme.  A number of towns in my constituency, such as Enniscorthy and Wexford, have benefited greatly from the scheme.  The scheme has expired for those towns, which is unfair.  It was expected that on 1 August a new tranche of provincial towns would be announced but this was deferred to 1 October.  We were then told, in reply to parliamentary questions, that the matter was running into difficulty with the EU Commission because of the tax incentives.  We then expected that it would be announced on 1 January.  We still have no announcement and my fear is that the decision on regionalisation, which has scuppered the economic development of the east coast, will ensure that any area which does not have Objective One status, as proposed by the Government, will be excluded from the urban renewal scheme.  Will the Minister clarify whether we will have another urban renewal scheme or whether it will be confined to certain areas?</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to give away the volume of money which has been given away without having some good elements in the budget.  I welcome the tax credits and the thrust of the income tax changes.  However, there are very few imaginative changes in the area of consumption. The fundamental problems of the economy, in terms of perpetuating disadvantage and sustaining the boom, have not been properly addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for sharing his time with me.  The only positive aspect of the budget was the tax changes, which I welcome. They are also welcomed by PAYE workers, who have carried the can over the years.  Some of them think the changes did not go far enough but it is a start in the right direction, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed that nothing was done for farmers.  The Minister brought out a new scheme called small farmer's assistance.  I ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to call off the hounds in north Mayo and the rest of the country because the attacks on small farmers over recent years have been outrageous. I thought this was happening only in Mayo until I saw what happened over the weekend, when a circular was issued by a civil servant. I have been in the House for only a short time but in that time I have never seen a civil servant being sent out by a Minister to explain why he sent a circular to the health boards.  The Minister has lost control of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I will make you a promise tonight, a Cheann Comhairle.  There are a few cases in my constituency which I am going to watch.  I have a few friends in the legal profession who like politics and I will ask them to take one or two cases against the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  What the Department has done over recent years has been immoral and wrong.  It has attacked the weak in society. Officials have gone to small farmers in the west and counted their sheep and cattle and then said they can make an outrageous amount on each animal per week.  The officials are not farmers, if they were they would know what prices farmers are getting in the marts.</P>
    <P>The events of last weekend proved to me that the Minister has lost control of his Department.  I guarantee to his officials that I will make a few of them busy over the next 12 months because I intend to bring one or two cases to court, even if I have to pay for it myself.  Over recent months the Department has lost control and nobody is willing to tackle the problem.  We saw the proof last weekend when the official from the Department explained to the public about the circular to the health boards.  It was an attempt to take a few pounds from the needy at Christmas.  These poor people are depending on payments from the health board, yet they are under attack.</P>
    <P>The same applies to small farmers.  The scheme announced by the Minister is a joke.  Deputy Noonan said a few weeks ago that the problem for the Taoiseach was that although he is extremely popular, he has many weak Ministers around him.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has lost control of his Department.  He has lost control of the area aid scheme.  I am due to debate that issue on the Adjournment tonight so I will not dwell on it now.  He has also lost control of the REPS section.  The staff there tell farmers they intend to conduct spot checks but there are no inspectors available to carry them out.  There is a wait of up to ten months for an inspector.  The Minister appears to be unable to tell his officials they should select the number of cases they can deal with and deal with them, instead of taking on more and more cases.  Now they have lost control.</P>
    <P>There has been a new development in the budgets of recent years.  They now run from the end of December in order to bring the local authorities and State agencies into line and to ensure January to January budgeting.  I welcome that. However, it is wrong that the Minister should announce increases in social welfare which will not take effect until June.  In the case of child benefit, the increases will not be paid until September. That is outrageous.  However, the public is not fooled.</P>
    <P>If there is one section of society which should be taken care of, it is women.  The child benefit payment is the only income they receive directly. There are many bad husbands in this country and the first place they go when they receive their social welfare payment is to the pub to spend the <Col N="74" /> money on drink.  The poor women are left to depend on the St. Vincent de Paul or moneylenders. That is when these women suffer.  These women rely on the child benefit payment to buy school books, shoes and other items in addition to doing Santa at Christmas.</P>
    <P>What has this Government done?  It has given £20 million to the bookmakers.  The Ministers are fond of horse racing and the GAA so they give these sectors as much as they like.  However, they cannot give women a few extra pounds each month.  The increase announced by the Minister is 75p per week per child from September to January. The women and children of this country are worth more than 75p.  This is outrageous.  It is time to get our priorities right.  Even at this late stage something could be done to increase the child benefit payment.  What is happening at present is a scandal.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has any control left &mdash; I do not think so &mdash; he might consider taking on his officials in the Department on this matter.  They seem to be walking all over him and are trying to walk all over the ordinary citizen.  However, with the help of my colleagues, I intend to put a stop to that.</P>
    <P>The carers of the elderly are another section of society which has been treated badly.  There was never so much money available to the Government and I believed that it would at last do something for carers.  I hoped that between £30 and £40 would be given to people who do not qualify for the carer's allowance because of the means test.  They should be given some recognition. There is little point talking about tax breaks. They are only for the rich, as I constantly remind members of my own party.  Tax breaks are not much good for the poor or for middle income families.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have given carers between £30 and £50.  It would be a small contribution in recognition of their wonderful work.  Perhaps something can be done in that regard next year. The people who care for the elderly at home are not a burden on the State.  They are saving the State the cost of putting the elderly into homes or other institutions and of having to pay for doctors, hospitals or nurses.  They do this task for nothing and they deserve recognition.  The carers' association lobbied hard but was disappointed that nothing was done for them on this occasion, as I was.</P>
    <P>Another item worth mentioning is the fuel allowance.  There is no such thing as a summer in this country.  We have experienced 18 months of rain and, in my opinion, the weather broke the day this Government took office and it never recovered.  There is now a permanent winter so why can the fuel allowance not be given, for the sake of the few million pounds, to people in need throughout the year?</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the vehicle registration tax.  The Minister's announcement of an increase is a scandal.  I remember when every Member of <Col N="75" /> the House was trying to convince the Irish people of the benefit of joining the EU.  The biggest carrot was the promise that it would be possible to buy cars in Dublin, Brussels, Glasgow, Cavan, Monaghan, Westport and Castlebar for the same price because there would be no differences in tax.  In this budget, however, VRT has been increased.  That is a scandal.  It is not right to tell people one thing at one time and something different later.</P>
    <P>I do not care about the green brigade.  People need cars, particularly good cars.  There are so many fatalities on the roads at present that it is essential to have a good vehicle, particularly if one must travel by car regularly.  I have two suggestions to put to the Minister.  The first is to abolish VRT.  If that is not possible, he should not implement the increase until March or April of next year.  That would be fair to the dealers.  I have no interest in this area but I was speaking about VRT to the owner of a small garage yesterday who has arranged to sell about 12 cars. Everybody has, at some stage in the past, bought a new car and everybody knows that a person is unlikely to buy a car in October or December. Somebody who is planning to buy a car for the new year will do the deal in those months but take possession of the car on 1 January.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree this is a fair point.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be fair to these dealers in terms of the deals they have done.  He should wait until March or April to implement the VRT increase so the people who have made a deal to buy a new car will not be obliged to pay up to £700 more in price.  Otherwise there will be friction between the dealer and the customer.  It would be preferable not to implement the increase at all but if the Minister intends to so do, he should defer it until March or April next year. It is a reasonable request on behalf of an industry which went through a terrible slump for many years.  It has done well in recent years with record numbers of new cars being purchased.  What is the point in penalising it again?  The Minister should consider this in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two more points about social welfare.  Last year in my health board area, the guidelines for a medical card were increased by £1 per client and £1.50 per couple.  That is outrageous. A person who receives an increase of £3 in his or her social welfare payment and who only secured the medical card in the previous year by a margin of £2 or £3 will lose the medical card this year.  There was a case in my constituency in which the local authority, which sometimes acts as if it is accountable to nobody, did not carry out the rental valuation over a single year but on a two year basis.  The couple concerned received a £5 increase in social welfare but Mayo County Council took £4 of that increase from them.  That is wrong.  The guidelines should change in line with social welfare increases.  There is little point <Col N="76" /> giving somebody an increase of £3 if they lose their medical card and the local council takes £2 of it.  Something should be done about this.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to housing.  The budget failed the many thousands of people who are waiting to build or buy their own home or who are depending on the local authority to provide them with a house.  I expected to see the introduction of many schemes in the budget.  I call on the Minister to provide more funding for local authorities to open green areas, to install water and sewerage facilities in them and to make land available for housing.  He must stop the speculators because they have made great profits in recent years.  I speak as an auctioneer.  Builders now come in and pick a number from the top of their head when deciding how much they will charge for a house.  The reason for this is the shortage of land and available houses.  The way to deal with this is to ensure land and houses in excess of demand are made available, thereby making everybody competitive.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Yates, I was disappointed there was no increase in the first time buyers grant.  In the context of house prices £3,000 is outrageous. Why was there no increase in grant for young couples?  I was also hoping something would be done in relation to stamp duty for first time buyers of second hand houses, which should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Of most concern to those who come to my clinics are the grants available to renovate old houses.  There are three grants available in my area and I presume the position is the same in the rest of the country.  First, there is special aid for the elderly which is administered by the health board.  The health board has begun a new policy. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to send a circular to all health board officials to put an end to the outrageous demand on pensioners of £1,000 in the context of works amounting to £2,000 or £3,000.  What is the country coming to and what are officials in the Department thinking about?  Have they lost touch?  A policy should be introduced whereby these officials would be sent on a regular basis to Deputies' clinics to see how the other half live.  The officials in their ivory towers in Dublin do not know what is happening. Somebody in the Department of Health and Children should write to the health boards to stop this outrageous behaviour of looking for £1,000 from pensioners for jobs costing £3,000.  If a pensioner had £1,000 they would not ask the health board for a grant.</P>
    <P>Disabled person's grant is also available and the Minister has increased it and provided additional funding.  However, not enough money is provided and people are waiting up to 15 months for applications to be examined.  The other grant is the essential repairs grant of £1,800. Where would one get a roof repaired for £1,800? This should be £3,000 and I ask the Minister to examine it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> This again was a budget for the rich and God help the poor as they have not been thought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Often times the public asks what the difference is between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  One could spend a long time saying what the real differences are, but there is one very significant difference, namely, whenever there is a good and growing economic climate we hear voices from Fine Gael saying that after boom comes bust.  This is largely part of the Fine Gael anatomy as it has presided over so much of the bust times that it is almost hoping it will happen.  We promise people that through this budget we are carefully ensuring the economy and job creation will continue to grow steadily.</P>
      <P>I have no idea how Deputies Ring and Yates sat in the House at a time when it took three budgets to give to old age pensioners what this Government has given in one budget.  How was it possible for the Deputies to sit comfortably in their seats during those three budgets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How was it possible for them to sit in their seats when 7,000 or 8,000 were being taken out of the tax net in one year while this Fianna Fáil led Government has taken 80,000 out of the tax net in one year?</P>

      <P>How was it possible for the Deputy to be comfortable when this was happening? This figure has been increased to £100, with 15,000 elderly people coming out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on a very balanced, fair, imaginative and successful budget.  In the 1970s I remember the late Deputy, Mr. Paddy Burke, saying great things have happened in our time.  There is no doubt that the growth in the economy and the ability to maintain it and increase employment was never better.  The Government's strategy in the budget and the Book of Estimates is to have the greatest possible investment in social inclusion, to continue to improve the public finances and to ensure that as EU funds begin to diminish we have the capacity to maintain growth and the strength in our economy to continue investment from our own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that people are giving out <Col N="78" /> about our attempt to reduce the national debt. Every sensible person knows that when they have a surplus of cash they can, if they wish, spend it on consumer items, on improving their home or on reducing existing debts.  It has always been a sensible combination to reduce debts as this ensures funds are available each year which can be spent at one's own discretion.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the tax provisions was to take more people out of the tax net, to substantially increase the level of tax returns to low income groups, to equalise taxes as far as possible and not have people on very high incomes benefiting substantially more than people on lower incomes and to increase relief for the elderly.  By any standard the budget has brought in fundamental changes and will be of benefit to people on low incomes, eliminate the poverty traps, reform the tax system and meet the needs of people most in need of benefit.</P>
    <P>Since my first day in public office I have had a deep-rooted interest in education, the disadvantaged and physical and mental handicap.  I am delighted the budget for 1999 will have a big impact in these areas and will improve the quality of life for many.</P>
    <P>Ireland's most valuable asset is our people, particularly our young people.  We already have a reputation for excellence in education.  Because our future prosperity will be dependent on the capabilities of those people who will be entering the workplace, the Government is very conscious of the need to ensure the right education with appropriate content to the highest standards.  This is the surest way to secure the future of our young people and the future social and economic prosperity of the island.</P>
    <P>The additional money provided for the education sector in the budget will increase spending in 1999 to £2,623 million, an increase of over 9 per cent on the provision for 1998.  The published Estimates already provide £205 million more than was provided in 1998 and allow for the largest increase in direct funding of primary schools in the history of the State.  In addition, they provide for significant teaching and child care assistant resources to assist children with special educational needs.  The budget allocates significant additional funding to education initiatives related to disadvantage.  These additional initiatives, costing £19 million in a full year, will address the problems of adult literacy, the need to encourage children to complete second level and the development of psychological services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates touched on the number of children with literacy problems on leaving the primary sector, a problem the Government is addressing in the most fundamental way possible. As a result of the programme, 225 new primary teachers will be appointed.  There will be remedial services available in every primary school from next September.  Home-school liaison teachers will be appointed to every disadvantaged school while at second level 225 new teachers are being appointed.  Combined with a very significant <Col N="79" /> change in the manner of dealing with over quota staffing in secondary schools, these new teachers will enable the move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.  In the health services there are major improvements in both the capital and current programmes.  It is no harm to compare the 1995 and 1997 figures, when there was a total of £309 million invested in capital expenditure in the health area.  For 1998 to 2000 it will be £467 million, an increase of £150 million to improve facilities in our hospitals and other health care resources.</P>
    <P>Regarding the capital programme, it was interesting to hear Deputy Yates deviating from the course set by Deputy Noonan, who suggested we were overheating the economy by providing a substantial increase in the capital programme. How is it possible for Opposition Deputies to sit comfortably when the capital programme was being increased by 9 per cent?  It is being increased by 30 per cent this year, and the evidence of that is in telecommunications, infrastructure, housing and right across the spectrum of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will agree when I say that last Wednesday's budget was a radical one, one which concentrated on the low paid and the disadvantaged in our society.  The Government remains committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation.  This is being done to reward effort and to improve the incentives to work. Including the personal tax package of £581 million announced on budget day, the total amount actually provided for reducing personal taxation in the past three years is nearly £1,500 million, much higher than the Partnership 2000 commitment of £900 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> After careful consideration of the matter, the Government has decided to move towards a tax credit system.  This year this will involve the standard rating of the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowance.  To ensure that there are no losers from the move to standard rating, the standard rate income tax bands are being increased from £10,000 to £14,000 for a single person, and from £20,000 to £28 000 for a married couple.  For the tax year 1999-2000 the threshold for the top tax rate will be £14,000 for a single taxpayer and £28,000 for married taxpayers.  These are figures that could only have been dreamed of three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>The effect of these changes will be to ensure that single people on PAYE will not pay income tax on earnings under £100 per week.  As a result of the budget almost 80,000 people will be removed from the tax net and the number of people on marginal relief, facing a marginal rate of tax of 40 per cent, will fall from just under 82,000 to just over 24,000.  We have also taken 17,000 from the higher rate of tax.  These are very significant achievements.</P>
    <P>In addition, as well as increasing the personal rates of old age pension by a further significant amount, the tax exemption limits for those people aged 65 years of age and over are being unified and substantially increased to £6,500 per annum for single people and £13,000 per annum for married couples.  This will mean that married couples aged 65 or over will be exempt from income tax on income up to £250 per week.  Over the past few days many people have stopped me in the street to tell me the difference this will make to their lives.</P>
    <P>The Government is also conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system.  The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues.  The Government has discussed this area in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further.  In doing so it will take into consideration the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 working group on child care which is expected to finalise its report shortly.  I can understand the disappointment of some in this area.  However, it is important that we develop the correct policy in this area.  It is right that we should improve the supply of child care.  As a means of facilitating and encouraging this the Government has decided that the provision of certain cre che facilities by employers will no longer be subject to a charge to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind.  Furthermore, the Finance Bill will provide for capital allowances to allow for the write off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.  This capital allowances regime will also extend to providers of child care services generally in the community.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided for enhanced reliefs for carers and a range of new reliefs to aid the <Col N="82" /> provision of convalescent medical facilities, to improve the availability of student accommodation and to alleviate traffic related problems. These reliefs may be small steps but they are important ones.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reducing the corporation tax rate to 12.5 per cent on trading income and to 25 per cent on non-trading income from 1 January 2003.  From 1 January 1999, the standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced from 32 per cent to 28 per cent.  The lower 25 per cent rate will remain unchanged but will apply to the first £100,000 of profits rather than the current £50,000.  The budget set out a philosophy, a tax regime to aid investment and job creation.  I fully endorse the approach taken by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The range of social inclusion measures in this budget were designed to build on what has been done in recent years.  Partnership 2000 committed the Government to spend £525 million over three years on social inclusion.  The actual amount that has been committed over those three years will be almost double that figure and close to £1 billion.  This shows yet again this Government's determination to ensure that all parts of society can benefit from the continued strong performance of the Irish economy.  The major social inclusion measures announced include an increase in the personal rate of pensions and related payments by £6 per week.  This adds to the significant increases announced last year.  The rate of the qualified adult allowance will also increase by £3 per week.  These increases again go a long way towards meeting our promises to the older members of our community, and Deputy Ring's comments were very hollow.</P>
    <P>In general, personal rates of social welfare payments will increase by £3 per week.  The qualified adult allowance will increase by £2 per week. Additional increases are being provided for personal rates for those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances, thereby bringing social welfare rates for all categories up to at least the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, upon which the Opposition does not seem to want to comment.</P>
    <P>The carers scheme will improve considerably. An extra £200 will be paid each year to recipients as a contribution towards respite care.  The scheme will be widened to cover the carers of children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance. The residency conditions will be relaxed as will the requirement that the carer must provide full-time care and attention.  Apart from the general level of increase announced in health spending before the budget, it also provided just over £45 million for further developments, including a hospital waiting list initiative, services for the elderly and mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, announced a significant allocation of £57 million to tackle educational disadvantage.  The additional money provided <Col N="83" /> will be used, among other things, to target adult literacy, the need to encourage children to complete second level education and the development of the school psychological services.</P>
    <P>Despite our success in reducing the numbers on the live register, more needs to be done to make sure the unemployed have the necessary skills to enable them to access the jobs that are available.  The extra measures announced in the budget include job clubs to equip the unemployed with skills to find employment and a bridging programme for the long-term unemployed to ensure they can participate on FÁS programmes with the best employment prospects.</P>
    <P>This budget would not have been possible if it were not for the strong performance of the economy in recent years.  However, the very strong growth cannot last indefinitely and account must be taken of what is happening in the world economy. Growth in our trading partners is expected to slow down next year and, as a small open economy, Ireland cannot expect to remain immune to these developments.</P>
    <P>This is the fifth year in succession that the economy has experienced very strong growth in both GNP and GDP.  Employment growth is continuing strongly in 1998 and the general Government budget balance was in surplus in 1998, close to 2 per cent of GDP.  However, a note of caution should be sounded.  The performance of the economy has given rise to heightened expectations of what the Government can provide.  This is reflected in the level of demands for additional expenditure, tax cuts and extra tax reliefs.  In addition, the performance of the economy is generating certain other pressures including public sector pay, the tightness of the labour market, increasing house prices, the need for further infrastructural investment, increased competition both in general and for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that we have sufficient resources to meet any challenges in the future, whatever their cause.  I am sure Deputies will agree that the budget has been radical and innovative. The House will also agree that this budget has been one of fairness.  I am satisfied that it is prudent and will help us to meet all future challenges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea) Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the provision in the budget and the 1999 Estimates for items within my area of responsibility. I acknowledge that 1998 was a particularly difficult year for voluntary youth organisations. They were forced to provide increased levels of service in very strident budgetary circumstances. I have gone to great lengths to get them extra money and I have succeeded.  A Supplementary Estimate for £380,000 will be moved before a committee of the House tomorrow and I am sure it will receive unanimous support.  That will bring funding for the voluntary youth sector up to a reasonable level for 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> While this additional funding is significant in terms of maintaining and supporting existing services I am very gratified that I have also secured an increase of £1.5 million in the budget for the coming year.  This is the single largest increase in youth service funding since the introduction of lottery funded support in 1988.  It will allow for the continued expansion of the service and, in particular, will guarantee support for voluntary input on which the service is based.  I have indicated on many previous occasions my belief that our youth services are ideally placed to complement the work of the formal education sector.</P>
    <P>The work of voluntary youth organisations enhances the capacity of young people to deal with the effects of unemployment, poverty, deprivation, injustice, inequality, etc., and it also helps them to become involved in effecting change. Funding under the youth services grant scheme provides financial assistance to the 35 national and major regional voluntary youth organisations which support local clubs and units throughout the country and special youth work projects for disadvantaged young people.  I assure the House of my total commitment to these organisations in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>When considering the value of grants paid to youth organisations the significant involvement of unpaid volunteers should not be forgotten.  The extraordinary dedication of volunteers who work with young people gives a substantial multiplier effect to State grants, making investment in youth work extremely good value for money.  This year my Department provided funding for the operation of more than 150 special projects to assist disadvantaged young people.  Unfortunately, as Deputies will be aware, such schemes do not operate in many parts of the country.  I wish I had the money last year to expand the operation of the schemes, but I will expand them next year.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the crucial role which information plays in the personal and social development of young people.  To this end, my Department provided funding last year for the upgrading of computer equipment and software in the national network of youth information centres, which number 27, as well as providing for staff training.  I look forward to the publication of the youth work Bill early in 1999, which will put the entire voluntary youth work sector on a statutory footing and will consolidate the sector.  It will bring all the relevant provisions together and ensure the best value for money is obtained for the money invested in the voluntary youth scheme.</P>
    <P>In January 1998 I published the school transport review committee's report, which undertook a comprehensive study of the entire school transport system.  The report was circulated to all relevant and interested parties for their views.  Its recommendations dealt with a broad range of transport issues, including the question of escorts and special services.  It estimated that the cost of providing an escort service on all special transport services would be £1.9 million per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> It has been a priority of mine to secure additional funding for escorts and harnesses on special school transport services.  I was committed to achieving this aim given the fact that funding remained static at £150,000 per annum since 1994. Having forwarded proposals to the Cabinet to have an escort on every school bus carrying physically and mentally disabled school children I am particularly delighted with the £1.7 million increase in 1999 which I have received for the expansion of this service and the funding of harnesses. This brings the total funding available for such provision to £1.8 million in 1999 and it means that before the end of the year every bus carrying special needs children will have an escort.  In addition to this most welcome and significant development, my Department is preparing a comprehensive guide on school transport to be published early in 1999.  An extensive safety campaign aimed at school transport users will also be launched then and will continue during the year as part of Bus Éireann's ongoing safety promotion.</P>
    <P>1998 was a very busy and productive year for adult education.  A Green Paper on it was published and my Department and I developed a variety of new initiatives.  The Green Paper published on 24 November sets out a range of recommendations for the future development of adult education within the framework of lifelong learning.  One of the highest priority recommendations is the establishment of a national adult literacy programme, which will incorporate key features of awareness, outreach, development of local referral networks, flexibility in provision, a continuum from one to one to group tuition, staff development and standardised reporting.  This process is being made possible by the fact that when the Government came into office 17 months ago the provision for adult literacy was £2 million per annum while next year it will be £5.8 million.</P>
    <P>The main priorities in the development of such a programme will include the promotion of public awareness using a variety of printed and oral media, outreach strategies to target those most in need and the establishment of referral networks on an area basis involving key actors in the field, such as FÁS, local employment services, area partnerships, etc.  Flexibility means ensuring the literacy service is provided in accessible locations at a range of times, including mornings, night times, weekends and the summer.  There should be a continuum from one to one voluntary tuition to tuition in small groups, with the option of national certification.  There must also be innovation. There will be new approaches to basic literacy provision, including family based literacy programmes targeting parents and their children, new outreach strategies, intensive programmes targeted at those most in need, a small number of demonstration open learning centres, and distance learning.</P>
    <P>A good example of an innovative approach is the broadcasting of literacy classes over the airwaves, <Col N="86" /> which is funded by my Department in association with Tipp FM and the National Adult Literacy Agency.  Two hours of programming is provided each night on dedicated local transmitters in Nenagh and Clonmel for classes delivered by a literacy tutor.  This model has great potential for improving the quality and scope of the overall service, particularly for isolated rural dwellers.</P>
    <P>It is clear it will be essential to substantially increase investment in this area on a phased basis in the years to come.  At present an estimated 5,000 adults annually participate in the existing adult literacy programmes, and this number is expected to double with the additional funds I have secured.  In addition, NCAA certified courses at national certificate and diploma levels have been commissioned from Waterford Institute of Technology; these provide training on an in-service basis for literacy organisers and tutors in association with the National Adult Literacy Agency.  That will be further developed along the lines mentioned in the Green Paper. The other key recommendation in the Green</P>
    <P>Paper is the back to education initiative, and Deputies can rest assured no effort will be spared to commence it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group on literacy initiatives for the unemployed has also been established.  Under the women's education initiative, my Department has allocated £600,000, with the support of the European Social Fund, to voluntary women's groups in 1998 and 1999 to enable women to plan and pursue lifelong education opportunities and to acquire access to mainstream programmes.  Thirteen projects have been selected for grants and I hope to expand and develop this initiative in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We will shortly introduce further proposals on the question of an education bank.  We have made changes to VTOS, equalising the rates and conditions with those of the back to education allowance and we have abolished the 10 per cent quota, which had been a serious bone of contention for many years.  With reference to the contributions of Deputy Yates and Deputy Ring, moneys have also been made available in the financial year 1998-9 for the provision of child care facilities for participants in Youthreach, VTOS and senior traveller centres.  It is hoped this will attract people who would benefit from these programmes but cannot join them at present because of child care responsibilities.  We have provided the money to make a serious beginning in this regard.</P>
    <P>My officials and I have worked hard to secure this extra funding for adult education, youth affairs and the school bus service.  I thank them for the assistance they have given me, and I am delighted with the large funding increases which the Minister for Finance has allowed for those three areas in the budget.</P>

      <P>The fundamental image of this budget which remains in everyone's mind is that conjured up by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the last minutes of his contribution, when he asked us to visualise him as a happy-go-lucky Charlie, gambolling down the street with a smile on his face, a spring in his step, and £1000 million of our money in his pocket, who feels so good that he proceeds to deposit our money in the bank and to give himself a great deal of credit for this negative act.  He says that he has treated us harshly for the sake of the future, but that is arrant nonsense, as is the image.</P>
      <P>Why was it necessary to reduce the national debt by so much this year, when national income or GDP is of the order of £57 billion and the national debt, partly due to the good work of the NTMA, is down to £27.5 billion?  We are heading towards a debt to GDP ratio of 1 to 2, and the ESRI informed us that in that in the next millennium that ratio would be 1 to 4.  An analogy has been drawn with a householder who took out a mortgage in the 1970s; it appeared huge at the time but it pales by comparison with the current value of his home and his repayments.  In that context the Minister's decision was totally inappropriate. Most people expected him to run a general Government deficit and to save some money, but to deposit such a huge amount on our behalf was totally unnecessary, given our current circumstances.  He did so for two reasons: first, he was pressurised by the Department of Finance's mandarins, who are determined not to enter into obligations for the new millennium and the decades ahead, despite our wealth; and second, despite his folksy manner, the Minister is a hard man, a true accountant who believes in delivering a bottom line, accountancy result.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, we have massive infrastructural needs in this city and our other urban centres, as Deputy Carey knows.  We could have put the money banked by the Minister into the Dublin traffic infrastructure to provide a basic public transport system, but there was barely a nod in that direction in the budget.  One of our education unions is upset that our pupil-teacher ratio remains among the highest in Europe.  The initiatives taken by my colleague, the former Minister, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, on early start, remedial education and deprived areas have not been followed; the Minister had the money but decided not to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On social housing, he trumpeted that he was providing 4,500 &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, which returns us to the level of the mid-1980s when Labour was in power with Fine Gael, but the current waiting list is 45,000 families.  He is content to nibble at the problem, reducing the list by 10 per cent, even though he knows a fundamental initiative is needed.  I know what he should have done, and probably those on the Government benches know also &mdash; he should have provided mortgage <Col N="88" /> relief in respect of the large repayments which people face, expanded shared ownership schemes, etc.  &mdash; but he did not do it.  Training schemes for the unemployed received a derisory £23 million.</P>
    <P>Most shameful of all was the much praised £3 per week increase in social welfare payments.  In this city, entire families are existing on a basic allowance of £73 per week. The increases have been deferred until next June &mdash; what happened to the Rainbow Government's practice of moving social welfare increases back to April, when tax changes occur, or to January, as the Minister appeared to suggest last Wednesday?  Why could we not give people who receive these derisory payments these miserable increases in the next few weeks, rather than making them wait six months.  This Government has failed lamentably to meet the needs of almost one-third of our population and of our children, who still live in poverty.  The image of the Minister happy to bank £1,000 million on our behalf is a hoax.</P>

There is still no acknowledgement, let alone implementation, by the Government of a major strategic policy to shift people from private cars by the provision of public transport.  I understand the Minister did not hold this brief in Opposition, but the Government is in office over a year and the alibi of past Governments and lack of knowledge is no longer a hiding place.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, despite the fact that the Government had over a year to develop a coherent overall transport policy, none exists.  The nearest we came to it was the strategic management initiative of the former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Ireland is the only EU state that has not strategically invested in a modern urban and inter-city public transport network. Responsibility is still divided between different Departments and Ministers.  Initiatives are <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal.</P>
      <P>The country's major millennium project should be the construction of a modern public transport system, particularly for Dublin.  We do not need millennium cosmetic trinkets of dubious value. We require projects that will give lasting and real benefits to people who need their quality of life improved in addition to the benefits of an efficient and better environment which could be created in the capital city.  A major and historic opportunity now exists to put in place such a transport system as proposed in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Simple logic dictates if a bus carries on average 80 passengers and a train carries on average 500 passengers that the solution to traffic gridlock is to replace lanes of cars with high quality, frequent public transport.  Many commuters wishing to use public transport find that the DART is so full that seats are being removed or that they must wait for the next bus because the buses at peak times are all full and do not even have standing room. To increase bus capacity for rush hours, a fleet expansion of 350 to 380 buses is required.  At present, the total fleet is 900 buses.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced with great fanfare on the day the Book of Estimates was published a special allocation of extra money for Dublin Bus. The headline was &ldquo;£56 million extra for public transport&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say that all but £17 million was a rehash of the third allocation of the unspent Luas money.  Unfortunately, there will only be an extra 50 buses, giving a total of 150 buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not glad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When one asks Dublin Bus about the impact of 150 buses, one is told that it retires 50 buses a year.  The allocation will just about keep pace with the progress being made in replacing and updating buses.  An additional 350 buses are required.  Therefore, the Government's additional 150 buses must be viewed from the point of view that no buses are currently available and it will be late next year before the buses are on the streets.</P>
      <P>The only immediate public transport solution for the major cities, particularly Dublin, is to invest £200 million in fleet expansion, quality bus corridors, park and ride facilities and computerised traffic lights.  The annual subvention to Dublin Bus is the lowest of any capital city in Europe and is based on 94 per cent fare recovery of costs.  The Government's rhetoric on modal shift into public transport is strong.  However, its actions are deplorably weak.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently established a watchdog to report to her directly on the Luas project.  The watchdog should train its eyes on the Minister because she has done more to scupper Luas than anybody else.  The shelving last May of the overground, on-street Luas project, despite the Atkins report, was a monumental step backwards.  A limited viable project costing £221 million with EU funds of £114 million has been replaced by a leap into the dark of an unplanned, uncosted pipe dream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time, the Minister stated that the cost of the revised project would be £400 million plus. When she was pursued as to what &ldquo;plus&rdquo; meant, she most revealingly stated &ldquo;extra&rdquo;.  I understand that at a CIE board meeting on 5 November, the provisional cost was put at £671 million. <Col N="91" /> However, this includes only rough guesstimates of the cost of the tunnel.  When St. Stephen's Green is completely dug up for the entrance to the tunnel, nobody knows the geological wonderland which awaits beneath the city centre.  Not only will there be no northside connections in the lifetime of the Government, no matter how long it lasts, but it will soon become apparent as a result of the Government's policy of regionalisation involving the 15 counties on the western seaboard that no EU funds will be available for the entire proposal.  In a sustained effort to avoid the disruption of construction, the Government has consigned an equivalent to the DART for commuters from Tallaght and Sandyford to a distant and remote concept.</P>
    <P>The other vital component of our national transport jigsaw is our rail system.  This principally includes inter-city and suburban services. The two rail safety studies show that there is a predictable risk of rail passenger fatalities in the coming months.  This will either occur through a derailment or a collision.  The level of risk has been classified as intolerable and unacceptable. Old jointed track with rotten timber sleepers built in the 1920s and 1930s cannot sustain its current traffic without risk.  The signalling systems particularly at Heuston, Cork, Waterford and Limerick stations are outdated and obsolete.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the IRMS study of the tracks from Rosslare to Waterford, Mallow to Tralee and Athlone to Claremorris.  I have not addressed the Minister on this matter, although I have met her senior civil servants.  I am aware of the debate in the Seanad and I met the IRMS consultants.  Experts are currently studying on my behalf the unpublished six working papers put together by IRMS.  As a layman &mdash; I await expert opinion &mdash; I consider there are dilutions, omissions and gaps in what was finally put together.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed on being informed by IRMS that the orange document, which was the summary of its report, was not its summary, but the Department's summary.  I have seen the initialled changes but my particular concern relates to the three routes, Rosslare-Waterford, Mallow-Tralee and Athlone-Claremorris.  My fear, given the heavy volumes of traffic during the Christmas season, is that some of those routes should have been closed.  That is the key public safety issue.  I assure the Minister and her officials I have no hidden agenda, other than safety, about which I am deeply concerned.  It is an onerous responsibility for the Minister and is not one I envy.  If there is a doubt about it, it is better to close the line and make it safe than run a risk even if it greatly inconveniences people.  I await the Minister's implementation report in January but time is against us.  If some lines have to be closed in the interests of safety in the short-term, so be it.</P>
    <P>In recent months the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has had public hearings and is about to appoint consultants to <Col N="92" /> look at investment in transport.  CIE has unambiguously advised the committee the total rail investment required for safety and rolling stock considerations is in the order of £650 million.  This cannot be factored over 15 years.  All the debate on our railways has been in the context of grave essential requirements, rather than, as is the case in the UK and on the Continent, of fostering and developing rail passenger numbers.  I understand that in Britain one of the few things that survived the Thatcher era from the Labour Government of the 1970s was a grants scheme to move freight from the roads to the rail.  There is no special system here.  Given the small percentage of freight being carried on our rail we should examine whether that system would be applicable here.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Department of Finance has bought into the revised proposal, that the Minister has got from Cabinet the money for rail safety or that the immediate problem of gridlock in Dublin in terms of buses can be solved. Given what Owen Keegan, the DTO and others are doing, the QBCs will be in place but it is necessary that buses are made available.  I do not believe that is the solution.  These problems will not go away, rather they will get worse.  Four or five weeks ago my party Leader and I met the DART management to discuss the night time service. Since that service commenced it has not added to its rolling stock.  It is astonishing, given the growth in Dublin, that anyone could run their business in that way.  A person running the smallest hackney business for the past 20 years would not operate in that way.</P>
    <P>The other area I am most disappointed about is that the Minister has delegated the issue of bus competition.  I know how a large Department works.  A Minister must bring a proposal to Government, override, negotiate and drive.  Ten successive Governments have said they would reform the Road Transport Act, 1932 .</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a Bus Éireann launch in my constituency.  Bus Éireann officials came from Athlone to Wexford to launch nine return services per day from Rosslare to Dublin.  This is happening because Ardcavan Coaches are competing head to head.  Competition is the greatest dynamic.  I have met present and former employees of Bus Éireann who are more alive to competition than any other unit of CIE.  I do not suggest cherry-picking and open competition but rather the Independent Radio and Television Commission equivalent to deregulate the industry and increase rural transport services.  The policy for a service for which no one else can obtain a licence dates from the 1960s.  The Minister could do more to achieve her viability plan by moving in that direction than hours of consultation.</P>
    <P>There are lots of analyses but no resources. There is no evidence of new policy thinking. These problems are beginning to impinge on national life.  Normally transport would be a low level issue compared with the economy, taxation, employment, health care, education and crime. Public transport is now moving to the centre of <Col N="93" /> economic development and is becoming the central issue of people's ordinary lives &mdash; in some cases it takes 50 minutes to bring children to school and it takes one and a half hours to travel a short distance to work.  These problems are mounting.  The Minister has the clout within Government and in her party to make things happen but I see little evidence of action either through her Vote, the PCP or through policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is probably the single biggest issue facing the Government and the country.  I do not make that statement lightly but because a deficient transport network is the single biggest constraint on our ability to sustain our economic growth, even at a fraction of current levels.  Transport impacts on every sector, particularly in a peripheral island economy.  To function efficiently our economy needs to move goods and people.  It is a basic prerequisite of a viable economy.  If we fail to do that or do so inefficiently, inevitably costs rise and we become uncompetitive and lose jobs.</P>
      <P>The announcement in Donegal yesterday is clear evidence of how critical is the competitiveness issue in Ireland.  Already we are losing jobs because of transport problems, particularly in the capital city.  International investors are rational people who make rational decisions.  If they see a congested city which is inefficient they will not come here.  If here already, they will not invest further and will not expand their businesses. If costs are seriously escalating they will leave.  Unfortunately it is not only international investors who are mobile nowadays and who make those choices, so too are Irish people, many of whom are much less tolerant of State inefficiency and under provision of basic transport services.  They will leave the island altogether.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Government have referred to this problem and said it may not be such a bad idea if jobs and people were driven out of Dublin and relocated in other parts of Ireland. There is no guarantee whatsoever that such businesses would relocate elsewhere in Ireland.  It is much more likely they would take themselves out of this country altogether and reject a Government and a country which thinks so little of its capital city that it allows it to deteriorate into a congested, inefficient, unattractive, polluted city.</P>
      <P>Tourists make the same type of rational decisions.  They will go to some other trendy place just as quickly as they came here.  Regardless of the economic costs of urban congestion and under provision generally countrywide &mdash; there have been various efforts to quantify the costs &mdash; they come nowhere close to the social costs of congestion and lack of mobility in terms of utter misery, stress, inconvenience, delays and community severance endured by the citizens of Dublin in taking their children to school, getting to work and carrying out normal everyday tasks. Given the extent of the problem, this topic has replaced the weather as the topic of conversation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> Given that the dogs on the street recognise the extent of the problem, one would have thought that transport would be a priority for any Government preparing a budget, particularly in the most benign financial circumstances that ever pertained here.  Instead of that, we did not receive anything.  The existence of a transport problem was not even acknowledged.  One would have thought it would have come somewhere on the Government's list of priorities, somewhere above the problems of the betting industry.  Even gamblers have transport needs.</P>
    <P>I will not pretend that our transport under-provision occurred today or yesterday.  It is the product of years of under-investment in the industry and an unwillingness by successive Governments to tackle structural and institutional arrangements within it.  Whatever its genesis and the undoubted difficulties and costs associated with it, we are now faced with a crisis.  The Government has no choice but to tackle it.  No effort was made in the budget to begin to address the problem in any kind of meaningful way.  The only mention of traffic, related to increased VRT on larger cars, as if that would somehow miraculously improve public transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall the Dublin Transportation Office recommendations to Government presented to her last summer.  The measures outlined were those required merely to maintain the current levels of congestion, not to solve the transport problem.  That was not a very ambitious target, yet it has not been met.  The critical recommendation in that package of measures and the one which underpinned all others was the ongoing £14 million subvention to CIE.  That would enable the company to man and operate the buses and trains which are on order and which are being funded out of Luas moneys.  The success of all of the other recommendations depend on that subsidy being available to CIE. Quality bus corridors without buses and buses and trains lying in garages are a waste of money and only serve to deepen public cynicism about the Government's willingness and ability to tackle the traffic problem.</P>
    <P>On 14 October the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, stated that the additional £14 million annual subvention would be considered by Government as part of the Estimates/budget process.  Was it considered? Did the Minister remember to ask about it?  Did the Minister for Finance respond?  Did he express an opinion on the matter?  I have heard him express the rather extraordinary view in this House that the transport problem would not be resolved until the situation became so bad that there was a revolution.  That does not sound like someone willing to adopt a leadership position on the issue.  Was the case for emergency measures put to the Minister for Finance?  Did he receive any support from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government?  Did the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="95" /> Reform make a case for the additional £5 million required to extend the freeflow operation to a year-round one?  The value of this was seen only two weeks ago during the train strike when the Garda successfully regulated traffic.  I congratulate them on that.  Why were the relevant Ministers unable to ensure that the new buses being ordered were disabled accessible and used a clean fuel rather than one which will almost certainly involve Ireland in costly emissions trading arrangements with other less developed countries? Were these issues ever discussed or considered by Cabinet?  Did the Ministers ever get together to ponder solutions to the rapidly deteriorating suburban traffic situation in Dublin or the fact that, even though it is only half built, the motorway around the city is already operating at 96 per cent capacity in places?  Have they considered that more than 80 per cent of the traffic on the motorway is not bypassing traffic at all, merely people trying to get to and from work? Not alone are there no orbital bus routes which might help reduce the pressure on the motorway by offering people alternative ways of getting to work but there are none planned as CIE and Dublin Bus do not have the resources to meet that demand.  If CIE is to be so under-resourced that its prime consideration must always be its financial constraints rather than consumer demand, why does the Minister not licence existing providers or introduce legislation to allow these services to be provided by the private sector? Is anyone in the Government giving any of these issues any consideration?  Is anyone in charge of traffic?  Has anyone the interest or the will to take the transport system by the scruff of the neck and make the brave and bold decisions needed to transform it into a modern efficient system geared to meet the transport needs of a country which has changed utterly in the past five years?</P>
    <P>We are losing the battle against congestion in this city and others throughout the country.  The train service is unsafe, we do not have an adequate Nitelink service, we failed to introduce a late night DART service and the Luas system appears to have disappeared.  We have a transport crisis today; we cannot wait five or ten years for long-term infrastructural measures to come on stream although we must continue to plan and invest for the future.  The Government must meet the current needs.  Given the mess made of the Luas project, buses offer the only short-term solution. They offer a viable solution which could be implemented immediately if the necessary political will existed.  Bus travel could be provided through the public or private sector or both.  It is essential that buses be made sufficiently attractive and efficient to encourage car users to switch to bus travel.  To achieve that and transform the current system into a responsive, safe, high capacity, high frequency, integrated service which takes people where they want to go rather than where buses have traditionally gone, requires <Col N="96" /> major investment.  Above all, it requires a Minister and a Government who are willing to take charge of the problem.  I urge them to take the first step in that direction by supporting this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  A major public transport investment plan is essential to alleviate the problems currently being faced in Dublin and all our major urban centres.  We must seek to relieve the negative impact of traffic on the environment.  Road traffic has become the greatest source of air pollution and recent reports have revealed a major increase in air pollution levels in our cities.  These pollutants have a detrimental effect on our nation's health.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has stated that vehicle emissions from nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, VOCs, and particulate matter, PM 10s, are frequently above recommended guide levels in the city and will continue to be so at heavily trafficked roadside locations.  Nitrogen oxides are produced in the combustion process and can become toxic above a certain level.  They irritate the lungs, can cause bronchitis, lower our resistance to respiratory infections and can play a major role in atmospheric reactions which produce ozone, a secondary pollutant known to have adverse health implications as well as adverse implications for crops and other vegetation.</P>
      <P>VOCs are another group of airborne pollutants which have come to the fore recently.  They comprise a wide range of organic substances, including hydro-carbons and halo-carbons.  Vehicle emissions are a major source of these VOCs. While most are non-toxic, some are carcinogenic, such as benzene, an ingredient of lead-free petrol. VOCs play a major role in the formation of ground level ozone and can cause eye and respiratory tract infections, headaches, dizziness and visual disorders.</P>
      <P>Another airborne pollutant is particulate matter 10, PM10.  These particulates which are caused by combustion engines, particularly diesel engines, are known to effect breathing and respiratory functions, aggravate existing disease and damage the lungs.</P>
      <P>The rapid rise in traffic volumes in Dublin and other cities has resulted in a corresponding rise in emissions and pollutant levels.  A recent report by the office of the director of traffic for Dublin Corporation predicts that air quality will continue to deteriorate and fail to meet EU guidelines.  It states that vehicle emissions for nitrogen dioxide VOCs, including benzene, toluene, xylene and PM10, are in breach of recommended guidelines. It also states that it is estimated that a rise of ten micrograms in PM10 levels is accompanied by a mortality risk of about 1 per cent in the exposed population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent report by the Department of Health in the United Kingdom states that short-term air pollution can cause between 12,000 and 24,000 early deaths each year.  The number could be <Col N="97" /> higher as experts are unable to determine the effects of some common pollutants or the role played by long-term exposure to pollution.  This is the first official attempt to determine the health impact of air pollution in the United Kingdom.  A similar exercise should be done here.</P>
    <P>PM10 levels account for about 2 per cent of deaths as well as 10,500 hospital admissions in the United Kingdom each year.  The committee assumed there is no threshold below which health is not affected.  Those most likely to be affected by air pollution are the frail, the weak, those who are ill and young children.  Air pollution is unlikely to have short-term effects on healthy individuals but the impact of the long-term build up of PM10 has not been assessed.  Emphasis should be placed on reducing emissions by encouraging the use of vehicles designed to use clean fuels.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Bus fleet is mainly diesel powered. Diesel engines emit up to 70 times more airborne particulates than petrol burning cars with catalytic converters.  They emit twice the amount of nitrogen dioxide than petrol burning cars and five times more than LPG burning cars.  They emit twice the amount of hydrocarbons than petrol burning cars and four times more than LPG burning cars.  They emit ten times more potentially dangerous particulates than LPG burning cars. While LPG is odourless, diesel and unleaded petrol have strong odours.  If the Dublin Bus fleet is to be expanded, emphasis should be placed on the use of environmentally-friendly fuels.</P>
    <P>The negative environmental impact of diesel must be addressed.  Valuable lessons can be learned from the introduction by Bord Gáis and Dublin Bus of a bus run on natural gas to reduce emission and noise levels.  I hope this marks the start of a happy relationship.</P>
    <P>We are at the lower end of the scale compared to other cities in Europe when it comes to the abandonment of dirty diesel and its pollutants in favour of cleaner fuels, be it natural gas or LPG. The recent reduction in the budget in the price of LPG was a small but welcome step.  The owners of private vehicles and taxis should be encouraged to switch by providing a number of incentives, including the imposition of higher excise and taxation levels on dirtier fuels; the reduction of excise and VAT rates on cleaner fuels, and the reversal of the favourable excise duty levels which apply to diesel used for public transport.</P>
    <P>Private motorists and fleet operators can be assisted by providing funding towards the cost of conversion &mdash; direct and indirect subsidies are available in other countries where successful clean fuel vehicle conversion programmes have been introduced &mdash; and introducing a zero rate of road tax for clean fuel vehicles.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on transport produced recently by the British Government paid little attention to the effect transport has on air quality and CO2 emissions.  Ireland is committed to major reductions in CO2 emissions to reduce greenhouse gases.  Motor cars produce four times <Col N="98" /> their weight in CO2 each year and account for 20 per cent of global CO2 emissions.  Nothing is being done to reduce these emissions to their 1990 levels in keeping with the commitment given by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in Kyoto.  In conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Minister should seek to reduce noise and air pollution levels through the use of cleaner fuels.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) welcomes the Government's speedy decision to provide additional public transport funding in response to the Dublin Transportation Office's Short-Term Action Plan, thereby increasing peak-hour bus capacity by 20 per cent by end-1999 and peak-hour rail capacity by 60 per cent by 2000;</P>

      <P>(e) notes that CIE, at the request of the Minister for Public Enterprise, has prepared a series of medium-term investment reviews as an input into the Government's planning for the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion Fund assistance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for the attention it has paid to public transport and for affording me the opportunity to address the House again on the issue.  This debate is being conducted in a state of relative calm by contrast with the debate on telephone masts earlier this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the motion.  I also want investment in public transport.  We considered agreeing with the motion, indeed, I agree with most of its points.  However, I would be unable to agree to the scale of increases it calls for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objective is to improve the quantity, quality and safety of public transport.  Since taking office we have taken a comprehensive series of decisions towards that end.  In May we re-energised and extended the Dublin light rail project, effectively addressing the issues which had bedevilled it up to then.  We decommitted the EU aid for the Luas and reallocated the bulk of it to other public transport projects.  The result of this <Col N="99" /> initiative was almost an extra £100 million for public transport of which £63 million was for Dublin suburban rail, £26 million for mainline rail and £8.5 million for extra buses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Exchequer is providing the balance of the finance for the projects being assessed by the Luas reallocation.  CIE would previously have had to find the balance of £40 million from its own resources.  We obtained EU agreement for the first time to provide Structural Funds assistance for investment in buses.  No such agreement was given for the two previous plans.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Estimates for the fist time provide for direct State investment in the development of our bus and rail services and the Exchequer is, also for the first time, financing the purchasing of 100 extra buses by Dublin Bus and 50 buses from the decommitted Luas funding.  Deputy Yates referred to this as microwaving £150 million for buses.  However, when I inquired if any previous Government had given money to public transport to buy buses I was told that CIE had to provide them.</P>
    <P>I commissioned the first ever independent review of railway safety and I thank the support of the Opposition parties in that regard.  It is an awesome worry.  When I listen to the 6.30 news in the morning I do not know whether I will hear about a derailment.  That is what prompted me after Knockcroghery to have a study done that would lay out the state of the railways.  I wanted a case to bring to the Cabinet and the Dáil which showed exactly what was required.  I wonder why no previous Government did this.</P>
    <P>The Government acted immediately on the recommendations of the short-term action plan proposed by the DTO.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell attended the launch of the plan at the Conrad Hotel and I assure her that, with one exception, all parts of the plan were given the green light within two months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> I have adopted an innovative approach to the financing of public transport investment.  As well as establishing the precedent of direct Exchequer financing of capital investment, I have appointed consultants to advise on a public/private partnership approach to Luas.

      <P>Turning to the issues raised in the motion, I assure the House of the Government's determination to tackle Dublin's traffic problem.  I referred to the DTO and to the money to be provided by the DTO.  The bulk of the public transport recommendations of the DTO action plan have already been given the green light and EU funding has been provided through the allocation of the decommitted Luas.</P>
      <P>The measures in the short-term action plan to increase passenger capacity on the rail network include 16 additional DART carriages on top of ten already on order by CIE; 20 extra suburban rail cars in addition to 27 new carriages already on order; extended DART and suburban station platforms to cater for longer trains; the doubling of the rail line between Clonsilla and Maynooth to cater for improved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Kilcock has reopened.  I will consider the Deputy's request.  The new DART carriages will increase the fleet from 80 to 106. Since the DART was introduced there have been two Governments headed by the Fine Gael Party and two Government headed by my party, yet nobody asked if more hardware was required. The additional carriages will help to ease congestion and serve the extended lines to Malahide and Greystones.  These are expected to open next year.  The new station at Barrow Street is scheduled to open in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail package involves a total investment of EU and Exchequer funding of £63 million and implementation of all of the rail measures will increase morning peak hour capacity by 11,000. This is approximately a 60 per cent increase in total rail trips, or a 17 per cent increase in total public transport trips in the morning peak.  The bus services will continue to be the backbone of Dublin's public transport network, even after the improvement of the DART and suburban rail services and the introduction of light rail.  In the immediate future it is the bus service which has <Col N="101" /> the potential to increase public transport capacity.</P>
    <P>The DTO action plan recommended the acquisition by Bus Átha Cliath of a further 150 buses to expand peak hour services.  The total cost of the 150 buses will be met from a combination of Exchequer and EU funds.  I understand from Bus Átha Cliath that the buses will be introduced on a phased basis in 1999 beginning next April when eight will be introduced.  Twenty will be introduced in May, 20 in June, 10 in July, 20 in August, 15 in September, 20 in October, 20 in October and 17 in December.  The increased bus fleet will add a total of 9,450 extra bus trips in the peak rush hour, an increase of more than 20 per cent.  It will also ensure the effective utilisation of the network of 12 quality bus corridors, which are currently being developed.  Quality bus corridors are being provided to further enhance the priority, speed, reliability and overall quality of service that buses can provide on key routes in the greater Dublin area.  The corridors will be in place by the end of 2000.  Two corridors are already in place.  The Lord Mayor opened the Malahide Road quality bus corridor last Friday and a quality bus corridor is in place on the road from Lucan to the city.  Two more are under construction and a further six should be provided by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>My Cabinet colleagues frequently say there are bus lanes but no buses on them and want to know why.  Quality bus corridors took much longer to put in place than was envisaged when the idea was first mooted.  That was because people had legitimate concerns, which they made known, and because of that the planning process took much longer than expected.  The necessary additional funding for work on quality bus corridors was also provided as part of the Luas reallocation. The Malahide Road quality bus corridor, which was opened last week, has already resulted in significant reductions in bus journey times and a 20 per cent growth in bus use.  Overall, between now and 2000, Government and EU funds will provide an £89 million boost to public transport in Dublin. That is apart from funding provided from CIE resources.  For example, Dublin Bus will fund the replacement of 120 buses from its resources over the next two years.</P>
    <P>We had a recent debate on rail safety and I made copies of the report on that subject available to each Deputy.  It covered all aspects of railway safety, including infrastructure, rolling stock, safety procedures and safety culture.  The main findings of the report called for an urgent and major investment to improve the safety of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure. The report also called for the implementation of a systematic approach to the management of safety.</P>
    <P>The consultants estimated that a 15 year safety investment programme, costing approximately £590 million is required, of which £23 million must be spent immediately.  This overall sum includes approximately £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety <Col N="102" /> deficiencies in the infrastructure, £60 million to improve safety management systems and £20 million per annum, over the 15 year period, for ongoing renewal of the track of the permanent way.</P>
    <P>A high level task force was established.  It comprises senior officials from my Department and the Department of Finance together with representatives of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  Its function is to make prioritised recommendations to address the safety issues.  Some of the major recommendations made by the consultants concerned issues related to safety procedures and safety culture generally.  The task force is due to report by the end of next month.  It has met twice and is making good progress on its assignment. The end of January reporting date is consistent with the consultants' recommendation that implementation plans should be agreed within three months of the publication of the report.  The consultants produced a very fine hard hitting report. They identified, in plain language, the many issues which need to be dealt with quickly and thoroughly.  The best contribution we can make to improving safety for passengers, staff and the public is to ensure that the recommendations of the report are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The light rail project remains one of the key elements of the overall transport strategy for Dublin.  It is being planned in line with the indicative timetable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The light rail project is being planned in line with the indicative timetable I outlined earlier this year.  The public inquiry for the TallaghtAbbey Street line has just been completed.  Mr. <Col N="103" /> Justice O'Leary is completing his report and I am sure he will send it to me shortly.  The Department selected the consultants, Arthur Andersen, to advise on a public-private partnership approach to the light rail project.  The consultants will advise on the most effective way of structuring any public-private partnership to maximise value for money and the most appropriate form of partnership for the project.  Options range from design, build and transfer to design, build, finance and operate.</P>
    <P>I established a small light rail advisory action group.  I have not commented publicly on any of the appointments made by the Opposition, when it was in office.  It is snide for an Opposition Member to talk about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding future public transport investment requirements, I asked CIE to prepare a comprehensive series of reviews of its medium term investment needs for bus and rail. That was necessary so that the needs for investment in public transport could be properly identified and addressed in our preparations for Ireland's application for EU funding for the post-1999 period.  These reviews were submitted to my Department at various times throughout the year and in the aggregate amount to more than £1 billion for the period 2000-2006.  They covered mainline rail, Dublin suburban rail, Bus Éireann, the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and rail freight.  They did not include investment figures for Luas or Dublin Bus.  Last June my Department made an initial submission to the Department of Finance, which has the lead role in the preparation of Ireland's application for EU Structural and Cohesion Fund assistance.  That submission took full account of the reviews submitted by the CIE Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance commissioned the ESRI to review the various missions received.  It <Col N="104" /> will also consult the regional authorities and the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>It will lead to the completion of a National Development Plan, which will then form the basis of negotiations with the EU Commission funding in the post 1999 period.  That is where the fun will be.  It is too early to speculate about the type of transport projects that will be included.  However, the House can be assured that I will make the strongest possible case for investment in public transport.  I welcome the support of Members in this regard.  I do not say that in a jocular way, I sincerely mean that. Debates are worthwhile.  It has taken a while for Governments and Oppositions to realise that people want a proper public transport system and, if they had access to one, they would be willing to leave their cars at home and travel to work by bus or another form of public transport.  They will not travel by public transport if a proper system is not available.</P>
      <P>I echo what Deputy Mitchell said about the Garda involvement on the day of the unofficial rail strike.  The chaos people dreaded did not materialise.  There are a variety of reasons for that, which are worthy of study in their own right. Some people got up early to go to work, others got up late and others did not go to work.  I conducted a mini-survey on how the staff in my Department, who all turned up for work, got to work that day.  Some shared transport, some walked to work and others cycled.  There was a combination of decisions which enabled people to cope that day.  I will say again that I regret what happened on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The action of the Garda when Operation Freeflow commenced had an amazing effect on the traffic.  We made the case for a continuation of Operation Freeflow throughout the year but there has been no final decision on that yet.  It would be worthwhile also to examine the idea of a traffic corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> It is too early to speculate about the types of transport projects which will be included.  The House, however, can be assured that I will be making the strongest possible case for investment in public transport.  It is clear from what I have said that we face substantial investment requirements in the years immediately ahead.  Even in the current favourable economic climate, the resources of the Exchequer are not unlimited. The levels of EU assistance will decline up to 2006.  We therefore have to look at all possible funding options.  I have already mentioned public-private partnerships.  CIE will also have to do everything it can to maximise the internal financial resources it can provide to fund investment. Releasing cash from its property portfolio is part of that process.  The restructuring programmes being negotiated in the individual subsidiary companies also have an important role in reducing costs and releasing funds for investment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent restructuring agreement reached by unions and management in Dublin Bus.  In recognition of that agreement, I have directed the Department to conclude its negotiations without delay on a public service contract for Dublin Bus.  I will also shortly announce a positive response to the company's application for a fares increase.  This has been put to me by all sections of CIE.  In the summer the board asked me if I would consider a fares increase, bearing in mind that there had not been a general increase since 1991.  When the increase is granted in January the right wing economic commentators will ask why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The public will not be ecstatic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into office I found that ESB had agreed three price increases in advance with the previous Government for 1996-8.  Thanks to the efforts of its workers, it has made substantial profits and I did not proceed with the 1998 increase because I did not think it was needed.  There had been increases in the two previous years.  CIE has not increased fares since 1991.  There has been a cumulative inflation rate of over 16 per cent.  It has faithfully followed up on its partnership arrangement on wage increases.  At the same time we wonder why it did not invest in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The board asked for an increase when I met it in June.  I refused and said I would like to see it linked to proper restructuring in each of the companies and agreement of the public service contract.  The talks have since concluded successfully and I am giving a positive response to the fares increase on the basis that it is eight years since the last increase.  How long can a company go without an increase?  The unions also asked if I would consider an increase when I met them and I told them I would if it would help restructuring. That has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has shown genuine commitment to improving the quality of our public transport system.  Much has been achieved and I am <Col N="106" /> determined to ensure that this commitment continues unabated.  We have to make up a lot of ground.  I recognise the Opposition speakers have made the point that there has been underinvestment over the years.  I call that &ldquo;pass the parcel time&rdquo;&mdash; it happened to me with TEAM, which started in 1990 and ended up in my hands.  It is pass the parcel time with CIE because, over a series of years and Governments, everyone wanted cars, high speed roads and by-passes.  Then they found the human toll on the roads is enormous while the railways are safe and environmentally friendly.  If we can get public transport into shape, conclude the talks, secure the necessary funding for safety and enhancement, establish public-private partnership for Luas and continue to encourage the EU to fund buses, that would make up a package which is formidable and would allow us to move forward with investment.</P>
    <P>I give a pledge to the House that I intend to ensure that, when my time in the Department ends, public transport will be in much better shape than it was when I started.  That is not to denigrate any Minister who served before me. The time for public transport has come about. The realisation has dawned that people are better off in public transport on roads which are crowded.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Clune for her contribution on environmentally friendly fuel.  She quoted the model bus developed by Bord Gáis and Dublin Bus which runs on LPG.  That and other measures are needed if we are to make any dent in pollution levels.  Buses and quality bus corridors are the way of the future.  If we are to have extra buses, we must reduce their emissions.  Under the Kyoto objectives, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will have to put a clear focus on that.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this issue.  On the question of people with disabilities, Dublin Bus has agreed, subject to board approval, to begin a pilot test programme in March for accessible double-decker buses. Buses from three different suppliers will be pilottested over a six month period.  Depending on the result, Dublin Bus should be in a position to begin ordering accessible double-decker buses from 2000.  It will be a breakthrough, and I am setting out a compendium on railway stations in Ireland that are accessible for disabled people and which will include telephone numbers and names of people to contact in each station.  This compendium will be very useful to disabled people.  I agree with the Deputy that we are not a proper nation if we do not allow public transport access to disabled people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which seeks to assert the primacy <Col N="107" /> of public transport and the pivotal role it has to play in future policy.</P>
      <P>Transport and traffic have become major issues of public and political concern over recent years. The increased prosperity of certain sections of Irish society, the sharp rise in car sales, and the neglect of our public transport system have all combined to make traffic congestion a major social, economic and health problem that must be tackled by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Before I turn to the specific details of the debate I wish to comment upon the context in which this debate is occurring.  Public transport in this State has been starved of investment and resources for decades.  The recent rail safety report is a shocking example of this record of neglect.  In order to ensure a basic standard of safety on our rail system nearly £600 million will have to be invested over the coming years. However, our rail system is not unique in this regard and the whole of our public transport infrastructure has suffered.</P>
      <P>Neither the money nor the political will to invest in our public transport system has been evident until the very recent past.  In fact, over recent years the main debate about transport has revolved around the question of how we can dismantle our public transport services and replace them with private operators and, of course, the private motor car.</P>
      <P>This prejudice against public transport has its roots in the conservative philosophy of the new right, popularised by both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  This narrow, soulless view of society dictated that everything private was good and everything public was bad. Public transport companies were perceived as being no different to a private sector company. They should operate solely on a profit and loss basis.  If losses were incurred then the company had failed and should be broken up and replaced. It is worthwhile to note that the main proponents of this view probably never used public transport and conceived their ideas from their own privatised ivory towers.</P>
      <P>We on the left of Irish and European politics have always fought against this view.  We have defended the role of public transport.  Public transport plays a crucial role in the economic and social life of Ireland.  Any attacks on public transport have serious consequences for society as a whole.  The failure to invest in public transport has similar repercussions, and this is all too evident to any commuter in our cities today.</P>
      <P>Over recent years billions of pounds have been invested in the road system to accommodate private transport while public transport systems have been virtually ignored.  The direct result of this policy is the near gridlock we are experiencing in Dublin city &mdash; it is not much better in Cork, Galway or Limerick &mdash; and the severe traffic congestion that is clogging various urban centres throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of this traffic mayhem is hard to <Col N="108" /> value.  However, some estimates have suggested that the economy in Dublin is losing £1.5 billion per year as a result.  This compares with a subsidy of only £5 million per year to Dublin Bus.  The imbalance is clear, and the citizens of this country are paying the cost.  The message is that private transport has been a costly failure.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House this evening seeks to address this imbalance.  It calls for Government investment in our public transport system and as such it has the full backing of the Labour Party.  I acknowledge that the present Minister has done more in this direction than any of her predecessors.</P>
    <P>The motion addresses three specific elements of our public transport system namely, buses, the rail network and the proposed Luas project.  The call for a 40 per cent increase in the capacity of Dublin Bus is a welcome move.  At the moment there is a &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo; situation regarding bus services in Dublin city.  Many people who travel by car at present wish to transfer to public transport, especially those who are paying high on-street parking charges in the city centre.  This will no doubt increase in the future as the planned quality bus corridors across the city increase.  However, at present, especially in the morning and evening peak hours, Dublin buses are full to capacity and cannot cope with extra demand.  There is a serious overcrowding problem on buses at present and most buses are full after the first or second stop on the route.  Many people who are currently driving into work in the morning peak hours cannot transfer to the bus service at present.  There simply is no room.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this problem is addressed as soon as possible.  One of the most overdue and important developments in public transport in Dublin has been the decision to construct quality bus corridors.  At long last we have realised that road space is one of the most important commodities in modern cities and at last public transport will have its own dedicated road space.</P>
    <P>As these corridors come on stream, we must have the bus capacity to deal with the extra commuters that will no doubt begin to transfer from private cars to buses.  The Minister gave us an example of this on one of the newly opened corridors. If this capacity is not available, the whole project could descend into farce.  I welcome the fact that an additional 50 buses are on order and that a further 100 buses will come on stream in 1999.  I worry that these buses might in fact be simply replacing some of the clapped-out fleet we have.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls for the construction of the first three Luas routes.  My views on the Government decision of April this year are well known.  I repeat my opinion that not one shovelful of the Harney-O'Rourke tunnel will be excavated before this Government leaves office, and that another administration will be left to pick up the pieces because of this Government's indecision on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not barrack me.  Given this, it is imperative that the Government proceed with the construction of the other Luas lines.  Luas is a long-term investment for the capital city.  I am particularly concerned at the Government's failure to progress the airport-city route.  This line was the <i>quid pro quo</i> that the citizens of Dublin paid for the delay caused by the Government's decision to bury its head in a tunnel through the city centre.  Has any progress been achieved to date on this important much promised infrastructural link?</P>
      <P>The motion before the House this evening calls for substantial investment in three vital areas of Dublin's infrastructure.  However, as anyone who has followed the transport debate as it has evolved over recent years is aware, there are no simple solutions to traffic mayhem, and all the various elements of our future policy must not only work in themselves but must also work in unison with each other.  Integration and co-ordination are hugely important in the planning and implementation of any transport policy for a modern city.  In that regard, many other measures that are not specifically detailed in the motion before this House need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Lest the Minister thinks I am entirely negative, let me put forward some ideas as to what might be done.  As the Minister is aware, it is the policy of the Labour Party to put in place an efficient cost-effective public transport system that will replace the private motor car as the transport mode for large numbers of people in cities and on inter-city routes.  It will not be required that the transport companies return a profit.  Noneconomic, socially desirable services will also be provided.  To give effect to that Labour Party policy on public transport, a range of decisions would need to be taken.  All the planned quality bus corridors throughout the city should be made operative within one year.  These should be available to all public transport, including taxis and hackneys.  Exchequer and European funding should be provided to purchase the additional buses required for city routes &mdash; they may also be funded from CIE's own resources and may be leased from the private sector.  Secure park and ride facilities should be provided on the outer city ring by the transport companies to meet the restrictions on private cars in the inner city.  Effective bus routes should be introduced accordingly. Secure park-and-ride facilities should also be provided at suburban rail stations.  Cycle lanes should be developed in tandem with the quality bus corridors and in areas where quality bus corridors are not planned.  I saw a novel situation in the city of Aarhus in Denmark where, side by side with cycle lanes, they had roller-skate lanes which many adults were using to skate to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic lights should be programmed to give <Col N="110" /> preference to public transport vehicles.  On street light rail should be fast tracked, with all routes being developed simultaneously.  The proposal for underground light rail should be abandoned, saving £1 billion which should be used for the construction of the promised on-street system. Suburban heavy rail should be developed to allow for an efficient suburban service, with all old stations and some new stations on the route opening to meet demand.  This would include a connection with Dublin Airport.  Locomotives and rolling stock should be provided by State investment and through European funds.</P>
    <P>The limit on the number of hackney cabs and taxis in Dublin city should be removed.  Applicants for licences &mdash; which should have a nominal fee covering the cost of processing them &mdash; who have a vehicle of the required standard, a good knowledge of the city and the required PSV driving licence should be approved.  There should be fixed fares in various parts of the city &mdash; for example, from Dublin city to Dublin Airport &mdash; so that tourists and travellers are not ripped off by unscrupulous operators.</P>
    <P>Integrated ticketing should be introduced for all forms of public transport, excluding taxis and hackneys but including light and heavy rail trains and express, main route, provincial and local buses.  Fares on public transport should be pitched at a level to make the move from private car to bus or train attractive.  Zero fares should be used on a pilot basis on new routes and on routes with more pressure from the private transport sector.</P>
    <P>Private car access to the cities should be restricted in a number of ways.  For example, from Monday to Friday, inclusive, odd and even number registered cars should be excluded on alternative days; park and ride facilities should be provided free of charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Free parking in the inner city should be regarded as a benefit in kind and should be taxable.</P>

      <P>I hope the authorities will take on board some of those ideas when examining the implementation of plans to deal with this crisis in the city. The ideas have merit and have been tried and tested successfully elsewhere &mdash; we are not reinventing the wheel.</P>
      <P>This motion should be accepted by the House. Investment in public transport is essential if we are to make Dublin a living city, designed for the people who live there and the numerous visitors who flock to it each year.</P>
      <P>Years of neglect and ideological opposition to the very concept of public transport has resulted in the mayhem which thousands of commuters face in our city streets every day of the week.  At long last, the philosophy behind that policy has been discredited and accepted as nonsense by any right thinking person &mdash; I do not mean right-wing persons.</P>
      <P>It is now an economic and social imperative that we invest in public transport.  This investment must take account of the crisis we are currently facing and the challenges we will face in the future.  This motion is part of that process and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for sharing his time with me.  It is a statement of the stunningly obvious to say that transport and traffic have become a very big problem.  To a large extent, this problem has arisen from a failure to plan and understand that matters move on and develop in a way which has consequences and knock-on effects.</P>
      <P>We seem to work, to a large extent, on the assumption that matters must get much worse before we are prepared to take action, or allow action to be taken, to make them better.  One did not need to be a mastermind to predict that, given that the road infrastructure in Dublin city was more or less fixed and did not have great potential to be increased within the canal area and that it was likely the number of cars would increase as economic development occurred, we would have the gridlock we have today, and inadequate public transport.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister about the 77 bus route, which is one of my favourite routes and I am sure it will become her favourite route.  Perhaps she might go for one of those bus rides she takes from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see what life is like for people on that route.  She could join the large number of people standing at bus stops on the Crumlin Road and observe the number 77 bus <Col N="112" /> going past full.  It would be good for everyone if she were to do that.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes very difficult to get agreement on what should be done, and to get the public to agree to allow what has been decided to go ahead.  There is a need for public consultation at every stage of development of the transport network. There is a great need to communicate to the public that there is such a concept as the common good and that it is in everyone's interest, including their own, to allow a quality bus corridor to go down their road.</P>
      <P>People's concerns must be taken into account but the transport agencies should put much more effort into communicating to the wider public the general benefit which will come from such developments. There is a certain element of the NIMBY syndrome, whereby people want these bus corridors but on someone else's road.</P>
      <P>The clamping policy is a correct one.  The parking practices and road manners of some people are truly awful.  It is the careless, well meaning awfulness of the type of person who parks on a double yellow line and pops into the local grocer to get their morning newspaper or a packet of sweets or cigarettes.  They meet a few people in the grocer's, have a chat, then casually stroll out and are quite dismayed if they find a garda is about to put a ticket on their car.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Hazard lights are a truly terrifying invention &mdash; they are a sort of enabling gadget which allows people to block a whole lane of traffic.  That must cost thousands of pounds, if one works on the assumption that gridlock costs the public in the region of £1 billion or £1.5 billion.  I do not think the people who do that understand what it costs &mdash; it is a great pity that no attempt is made to communicate to them the sort of havoc and difficulties they create for large numbers of people.  Despite the fact there has been a clamp down in the city, there is still a long way to go.</P>
      <P>There is need for a much higher level of expenditure on developing the infrastructure and reducing fares of Dublin Bus.  The amount by which Dublin Bus is subsidised is the lowest subsidy of any European capital cities and is the second lowest of 30 European cities on which the Dublin Chamber of Commerce collected information. Buses in Rome are subsidised by about 75 per cent and those in cities such as Brussels and Copenhagen, which are fairly similar to Dublin, are subsided by about 50 per cent.  We need to have that level of subsidy to encourage the public to use the service and to bring it up to an acceptable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public transport has been the poor relation of transport, and Dublin Bus seems to be the poor relation of public transport, which is a huge pity. Given some of the recent developments, it is scandalous that the 150 new buses are not wheelchair <Col N="113" /> accessible, which is a very unfortunate development.</P>
    <P>It is important to experiment and try to get the public interested in using public transport.  To that end, Deputy Stagg's suggestion of zero fares is a good idea.  It might apply for just a short time, perhaps during the weeks before Christmas or during the summer.  We should at least experiment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  CTM Southborough Limited has supplied Dell Computer Company in Limerick for a number of years.  CTM bought into Southborough about ten weeks ago on the basis of assurances that the contract with Dell would continue, but unfortunately, that is not the case.  LMS Beech, an American company, came to Tullamore some months ago, without grant assistance, and was welcomed there by the Tánaiste.  It is now known that this company will take over the contract, with the consequent possible loss of 130 jobs at CTM Southborough.</P>
      <P>I am asking the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, if they are not already involved, to become involved in seeking alternative contracts to avoid the loss of jobs in this company.  CTM Southborough is one of only two major employers in Kells. Today the House heard about the serious effects of the problems at Fruit of the Loom in Donegal but the loss of the jobs in Kells will have a proportional effect on that town.  Nobody likes to see jobs being lost in any area.</P>
      <P>In the event of the company being unable to secure contracts, will the Minister support the county manager, who agreed yesterday to set up a task force, and ask the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to get involved with some business people to seek an alternative enterprise for Kells?  I call on the Minister to give approval for such a course of action should the company be unable to secure the required number of contracts to keep these people employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These workers have given more than 22 years of excellent service to this company.  It is unfortunate that Dell Computer Company should make a decision which could have the same reper- cussions <Col N="114" /> for Kells as a similar decision had for Mullingar. I hope account will be taken of the work of the company in trying to establish a plastics subsidiary in order to provide a better product. On the last occasion the product produced by CTM Southborough for Dell was tested, not one fault was found in the 98,000 pieces of equipment produced.  I cannot understand why Dell decided to disown a company which has given it such service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating a debate on this serious problem.  I thank the Tánaiste, her officials and the State agencies for acceding to the request to meet last week with representatives from the management and the workers unions at CTM Southborough and public representatives for County Meath.  It was a constructive meeting at which the Tánaiste and her party guaranteed us that they would do their best to resolve this unfortunate problem.</P>
      <P>CTM Southborough is a substantial employer in Kells.  Almost every family in the town would be affected by job losses in the company.  This company, which was taken over by CTM in recent months, has been in Kells for 22 years and many of the workers have been there from the start.</P>
      <P>Southborough always served the needs of Dell Computer Company to the highest standards and the news that Dell is transferring to another supplier is a huge shock.  All the employees worked hard on the Dell project and to be left out now, before the project has reached the end of its life, is hard to accept.  These decisions are made many miles away by people who have never heard of Kells or County Meath.  Workers in the company are dedicated and are trained in top quality production. There has never been industrial problems at the plant.</P>
      <P>Dell decided to move its contract to LMS Beech in Tullamore.  While this is good news for Tullamore, it is a disaster for Kells.  The same problem occurred in Mullingar recently and some of the workers affected were from north Meath. Is this the end or will there be more such occurrences? The loss of jobs is a huge shock to everybody, not only in the company but in the town. Kells benefited by almost £3 million per year from the company's presence and local business depends on the spending power of local employees.  Being the largest employer in the town, CTM Southborough had a positive impact on the town's commercial life.</P>
      <P>Every effort must be made to find an alternative business for the plant.  On taking over Southborough, CTM understood that the contract with Dell was secure.  If other suitable business cannot be found, it is imperative that another industry be found for Kells.  The loss of 160 jobs in a town that size would be equivalent to the loss of up to 4,000 jobs in our larger cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting of Meath County Council yesterday, I requested that a task force be set up to seek alternative business or industry for the town. <Col N="115" /> The county manager acceded to my request.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Department and State agencies will work with the county manager and the members of the task force to secure this alternative industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Deputies for the future of the jobs at this plant.  The company involved, CTM Southborough, was formerly known as Southborough International Limited.  The company has been established in Kells for over 20 years and is a major employer in the locality, providing valuable employment for up to 220 people.</P>
      <P>Southborough had, until September this year, been a wholly owned subsidiary of Unidare PLC and it specialised in the manufacture of sheet metal components to electronic and computer original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Dell Computer accounted for the bulk of the company's high volume business.  Southborough was not involved in the manufacture of injection moulded parts and it was recognised for some time that this could be a factor in its longer term viability.</P>
      <P>I should explain that many OEMs have for some time been moving away from in-house manufacturing to outsourcing of production activities which they do not see as core competencies. In doing this they are demanding a fully integrated contract manufacturing service on a globalised scale.  In this way, OEMs can adopt a single product design for the world and give it to a select number of fully integrated contract manufacturers who have globalised facilities and can manufacture the product to a common standard for supply to world markets.</P>
      <P>For the contract manufacturers or sub-suppliers, this globalisation means providing the OEMs with manufacturing facilities around the world.  Inevitably, market forces will determine that single location contract manufacturers will lose out to the larger, globalised and fully integrated contract manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with these developments, the major computer manufacturers in Ireland, as elsewhere, have strongly signalled for some time that they only wish to deal with suppliers who could both supply integrated components comprising both metal and injection moulded parts and supply all the OEM plants on a global basis.  As I said earlier, the inability of Southborough to function as an integrated supplier of metal and plastic components and its lack of a global supply capability have long been recognised as factors which could put its future at risk.  The company earlier this year identified as a potential partner Complex Tooling &amp; Moulding Inc.  &mdash; CTM.  This is a 30 year old private company operating six facilities in the United States serving the computer, computer peripheral and telecommunications industries in the US.  I understand the acquisition of <Col N="116" /> Southborough by CTM was completed in September.</P>
    <P>CTM indicated to Enterprise Ireland that its intention on acquiring Southborough was to invest in equipment to manufacture injection moulded components and to offer an integrated service to a number of companies in Ireland and elsewhere from Kells.  Their plans would have preserved existing jobs and CTM signalled that investment in injection moulding equipment could create additional jobs.</P>
    <P>However, Enterprise Ireland was advised on 20 November that CTM/Southborough had lost its Dell contracts to a rival supplier.  This has given rise to a significant proportion of the jobs at the Kells plant being under serious threat.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, on last Tuesday, 1 December, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, met with a deputation of public representatives and representatives of management and the workforce to discuss the serious situation arising at the company.  She conveyed to them her serious concern at these developments and indicated that IDA Ireland was arranging an urgent meeting with the US parent company, CTM, to clarify its intentions on the plant.</P>
    <P>A meeting between IDA Ireland and the president and chief executive of CTM took place in the United States in recent days.  I understand the company has expressed a commitment to keeping the Kells plant open and is currently addressing the restructuring measures necessary to achieve the survival of the plant.  However, notwithstanding such action, job losses of the order of 120 are expected early next year.  Both the company and IDA Ireland are also in contact with the company's major customer in relation to existing business. Simultaneously, the industrial development agencies are working closely with the company to secure the future of the Kells plant and offer every assistance in the company's efforts to identify alternative markets and job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I know this company has provided valuable employment in the Kells area over the years and I am aware of its importance as an employer in the local economy.  Every effort will be made by the Government to minimise the job losses involved and maintain the plant as well to find alternative jobs for workers affected.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to both of the Deputies and their Oireachtas colleagues in the county for their concern about this project and I assure them that their proposal for a task force has my full support.  I would like to see a taskforce established involving the county enterprise board, the county council, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the various other State agencies, so there would be in position some alternative structure to direct sustainability for the company and alternative employment in the Kells area.  I will recommend this to the Tánaiste and the Deputies can be assured that I, the Tánaiste, officials and the State agencies, including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise board, will do what we <Col N="117" /> can to ensure these jobs are sustained as far as is possible and that new investment is brought to the area as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is present but very disappointed that neither the Minister nor the two Ministers of State in the Department of Agriculture and Food are present.  I object in the strongest manner to this.  This is exactly what is happening to the general public in relation to area aid.  We cannot get a Minister, an official or a reply and this is why I have raised this matter tonight.</P>
      <P>I receive misinformation from the Department of Agriculture and Food as do my constituents. People are being told area aid applications have been processed and that payment will issue as soon as possible.  Eight weeks later they are told there is an error in their area aid applications. Another famous response from the Department is that the area aid application has not reached the office, even though people can prove they handed in their applications as early as May last year.</P>
      <P>Farmers cannot get through to the office.  Did the Minister do a deal with Telecom Éireann who are the real winners?  Farmers are robbed.  They are left on hold for 20 or 30 minutes when they telephone the office.  There is something very wrong and I wonder what percentage of this cost is the Government getting.</P>
      <P>Why does an outside agency deal with area aid?  It is paid by the State.  If farmers make a mistake they are subject to a penalty.  What penalty is imposed on this outside agency when an employee does not put the correct digit on an area aid application?  Is it penalised?  The outside agency never wants the issue of area aid to be resolved as it wants to be employed again next year.  What is happening is outrageous.</P>
      <P>Some farmers are told difficulties have arisen in their applications, and still they are not being notified by the Department.  Why does the Department not notify farmers when a problem arises?  Some farmers are notified and deal with the problem, but, six or seven weeks later they still have not received any money.</P>
      <P>Christmas is approaching and Santa Claus only comes once a year.  The Government is certainly not responding and getting into the Christmas spirit, as many farmers have not received their area aid, premium or headage payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How much is outstanding in terms of area aid? How many area aid applications are still unresolved in the 1998 period?  Farmers are waiting for their money.  This is the third time I have raised this issue.  Can the Minister assure me these farmers will have their payments for Christmas?  Last month the Minister said the telephone lines to the area aid office are again open. I will give the Minister £100 for the charity of his choice if he rings the office tomorrow morning and succeeds in getting through.  Enough is <Col N="118" /> enough.  Farmers have had a disastrous year and need their money.  Last year they got some price for their stock but this year they are getting nothing.  I am sorry the Minister and both Ministers of State, all from the east like the Three Wise Men &mdash; Santa also came from the East &mdash; are not present.  The three wise men brought gold, frankincense and myrrh: all we want for these farmers is money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a Government which has collective responsibility I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this matter. I apologise on behalf of my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and Ned O'Keeffe, who regret they are unable to be present to reply to the debate.  Deputy Ring spoke of Santa Claus &mdash; I thought his cousin was in the House last week when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, presented the most outstanding budget in the history of the State.  It was a budget of macro proportions which will have a micro effect right across the island.</P>
      <P>Information given in replies to parliamentary questions is correct at the time replies are furnished to Deputies.  However, experience has shown that an area aid application which is cleared for payment at the time a question is answered may subsequently become an error case.  Typically this occurs when the digitisation of a second contiguous farm results in dual or overlap claims against a previously clear case.  In such cases it becomes necessary to establish entitlement to the area concerned.</P>
      <P>To date more than £784 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes of which almost £484 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.  In the past week alone £12 million has been paid.  The corresponding figure paid at this time last year under the 1997 schemes was £465 million.</P>
      <P>The payment commencement targets under the Charter of Rights for Farmers for the main headage and premium schemes have been met or indeed surpassed this year.  In so far as the 1998 headage schemes are concerned, payment of sheep headage commenced on 21 September last, one week ahead of the 1997 commencement date.</P>

      <P>To date some £17.633 million has been paid.  Sheep headage top-up payments commenced on 26 November 1998 and £2.312 million was paid within a few days.  Payment of the 1997 top-up did not commence until 11 December last year.  Payments under the 1998 cattle headage scheme commenced on 26 September last, a full three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  Payments under the 1998 beef cow schemes commenced on 30 October 1998.  To date £83.983 million has been paid to cattle headage and beef cow scheme applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Of the 89,000 applications received under the 1998 cattle headage and beef cow scheme some 3,000 have not been cleared for payment at local office level because of problems of one kind or another.  In these cases the applicants have been written to about the problem on one or more occasions.  The second instalment of 1998 ewe premium was agreed at EU level on 2 October. The regulation giving effect to the rate was published on 16 October and payments totalling £24.699 million were paid to 97 per cent of applicants during the week ending 23 October 1998, which was never achieved before by the Department under any Government.</P>
    <P>Payments of the advances under the 1998 special beef premium started on 19 October 1998, as opposed to 1 November 1997 under the 1997 schemes.  The Minister secured this earlier payment date this year with an 80 per cent advance instead of the normal 60 per cent advance in order to increase the cash flow to farmers in the October to December period.  So far almost £79 million has been paid, which compares with £53 million paid at this time last year.</P>
    <P>Of the 158,000 special beef premium applications received from January to August, some 6,000 are under query from Portlaoise and in these cases the farmers concerned have been written to on at least one occasion.  Payments will continue to be made between now and the year's end so as to ensure that all eligible cases are paid their advances by 31 December 1998 in line with the charter commitments.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1998 suckler cow scheme commenced on 20 October 1998 which is ahead of the commencement date of 4 November 1997 under the 1997 scheme.  The earlier commencement and higher rate of advance applies also to this scheme.  To date almost £98 million has been paid.  The position at this time last year was that £73 million was paid.  Of the 73,500 applications received under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme, some 3,000 are under query at local office level and in these cases the applicants have been written to on at least one occasion. Payments will continue to be made between now and the year's end so as to ensure that all eligible cases are paid their advances by 31 December 1998 in line with the charter commitments.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1998 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October and on 25 September for oilseeds.  Some £86.065 million has now been paid to 97 per cent of applicants.  The remaining 475 applicants have been contacted and the reasons for non-payment outlined.</P>

      <P>Payment in these cases will issue as soon as outstanding problems are resolved.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing some 7,000 1998 area aid applications are still under query.  The area aid unit of the Department is currently concentrating all of its resources on the resolution of problems associated with these cases with a view to paying the farmers concerned at the earliest possible opportunity.  Not all applications received will ultimately be entitled to payment. For example more than 900 suckler cow applicants do not hold suckler cow quotas and are, therefore, not entitled to payment.  In other cases payment will be withheld because of the application of penalties.  In some case farmers omitted to complete an area aid declaration.</P>
      <P>The position is, however, that payments under the headage and premium schemes do not conclude at the end of a calendar year.  For example under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes the regulations provide for an advance payment in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments under the October 1998 suckler cow scheme cannot commence until the six months retention period expires on 1 April next.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate, therefore, that it is simply not possible, at this early stage, to provide an estimate of outstanding payments.  A record level of payments has been achieved this year with £784 million already paid to farmers under the premia and headage schemes.  Payments continue to be made as problem cases are resolved and farmers respond to queries from the Department. The Minister of Agriculture and Food's objective is to ensure the maximum delivery of payments to farmers this year and every effort is being made to clear payments in time for Christmas.  With the amount of money we have paid out, Santa Claus will not have much more to deliver.</P>

      <P>This is an important scheme on the priority list of Westmeath County Council, and the council is eagerly anticipating funding to permit the scheme to commence in 1999.  Lest there be any doubt as to the position, the extension of the Taughmon water scheme from Drummond Cross to Killucan is now the number one priority for Westmeath County Council.  It has been a long running saga, and the patience and forbearance of the people living in places like Drummond, Clonickivant, Huntingstown, Killucan and other areas that would benefit from this <Col N="121" /> scheme getting the green light, is now exhausted. The absence of a reliable water supply hinders the strong and earnest efforts of the local community groups and indeed local entrepreneurs in marketing the area for worthwhile industrial projects, which would readily come to this large area if there was a sure and adequate water supply to facilitate their demands.</P>
      <P>I have spoken with one well known local businessman who is a very important source of employment for Raharney, Killucan and the surrounding areas, and he is extremely eager that this water scheme would now get the go ahead, as its absence is limiting his company's capacity to extend and create further important job opportunities for the people of this large rural hinterland.</P>
      <P>The immediate approval by the Minister and his Department of the contract documents, which were lodged with the Department in 1984, for the extension of the Taughmon water supply scheme from its present extremity at Drummond Cross to Killucan, would allow the abandonment of the present village source, which is extremely vulnerable in quantity terms and indeed has been the source of considerable representations to Deputy McGrath and to me over a considerable period of time.  Westmeath County Council believes it would also serve the needs of Kinnegad.  In order to allow the continuance of this scheme from Killucan to Kinnegad, it will be necessary to upsize the pipes involved in the stretch between Drummond and Killucan to 200mm.  This would be vital to allow for increased development of both housing and industry in Kinnegad, and there are plans also for some housing schemes in Killucan.</P>
      <P>I understand that the estimated cost of the scheme from Drummond to Killucan is about £1.22 million and from Killucan to Kinnegad it would cost about £400,000, therefore the total costs would be in the region of £1.6 million in 1998 prices.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the future extension of this scheme from Killucan to Kinnegad would facilitate a very important group water scheme, the Cloncrave group water scheme, on which local residents have worked extremely hard.  This scheme caters for a large area extending from Cloncrave to Thomastown.  It involves about 50 households and numerous farms which are in urgent need of a proper supply of water.  These people have also waited patiently for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the proposed scheme is extended to include Kinnegad, the Cloncrave group water scheme will also be assisted and it will be an important boost to the service land initiative recently announced for Kinnegad.  The water capacity in Kinnegad would then be capable of serving a population of about 2,300 people, about four times the size of the current population.  The scheme once given the go-ahead from Drummond Cross, will also boost the low pressure supply in the Wooddown area.  In effect this scheme, if approved, would <Col N="122" /> provide water for a population equivalent to approximately 6,000 persons in total.</P>
    <P>The scheme is also important for the agricultural community.  The Minister will be aware of the need for a good supply for this important industry.  It is vital that the Minister end the uncertainty for these people, sanction, early in 1999, the documents sent by Westmeath County Council and allow the scheme to proceed to tender.</P>
    <P>I note from the budget statement of the Minister for Finance that he is allocating £50 million over the next three years to permit the upgrading of water facilities in small towns and villages.  It is payback time for the people of those areas, and what better way to start than to allocate some of this funding to this important scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time with me.  The contract documents for the proposed extension of Taughmon water scheme from Drummond Cross to Killucan have been in the Department of the Environment since 1984.  The estimated cost of the scheme at that time was £500,000, but with the passage of time the most recent estimate for the scheme is £1.2 million.  I raised this matter in October 1997 with Deputy Penrose and now, 14 months later, I again appeal to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to give this scheme the go ahead in 1999.  It would be a fitting tribute to Councillor John H. Keegan, who is the longest serving member of Westmeath County Council, having given 40 years of loyal service to his constituents. He has announced his intention to retire from the council next June and it would be a fitting tribute to him if the scheme went ahead. Councillor Keegan lives in this hinterland and it would be a fitting tribute to his service on the council over the years.  This scheme will provide a much needed water supply to a wide area of County Westmeath including Drummond and Clonickivant and the areas mentioned by Deputy Penrose and also improve the supply to the villages of Killucan and Raharney.  Thousands of households could benefit from this scheme and, thus, take away the need for individual wells and their potential for uncertain quality and quantity of water supply.</P>
      <P>A sum of £267 million has been allocated for water and sewerage services in 1999 by the Department and an additional £8 million was added to this figure specifically for the provision of facilities in rural Ireland.  The Minister has an ideal opportunity to provide a much sought after and needed service in County Westmeath and I ask him to prove his commitment to providing service to rural areas there.  He will be judged on his response to it.  I am very disappointed with the response I received to a parliamentary question which I tabled today.  It was very poor and if the Minister of State gives me a similar response now, I will be extremely disappointed.  I hope he has good news for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.  I will outline the broader picture in terms of investment in water and sewerage services before I deal with the specific matter raised by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>This year the Minister announced a major water and sewerage capital programme with the provision of £185 million, which is the highest ever annual investment in the programme.  Next year's provision will be about 50 per cent higher and includes the initiative announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget to assist the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in rural towns and villages.  Funding at such an unprecedented level clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.</P>
      <P>County Westmeath is benefiting from this substantial level of investment.  The 1998 investment programme covers schemes in Westmeath with an estimated value of approximately £3.5 million pounds.  These include Athlone, Annagh/Baylin, water scheme in respect of which tenders are under consideration by the local authority; Athlone sewerage, Westbank, scheme on which work is expected to commence shortly; Athlone water conservation project on which work is ongoing; Moate sewerage scheme which will shortly be substantially complete and Mullingar, Tyrrellspass, water scheme which was substantially completed this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to these schemes provision has also been made under the serviced land initiative to fund the Kinnegad sewerage scheme; a major extension to the Mullingar sewerage scheme and the Coosan, Athlone, surface water drainage scheme.  The total estimated cost of these schemes is £4.76 million, 40 per cent of which will be funded by the Exchequer.  In these circumstances, County Westmeath is getting a fair share of the available funding.  These major schemes will greatly contribute to removing existing development constraints in Westmeath and providing the necessary infrastructure to support economic development and tourism.</P>
      <P>On the specific proposal raised by the Deputies, contract documents to extend the Mullingar regional water supply scheme to Taughmon reservoir, which will serve Killucan, have been submitted to my Department.  This proposal is estimated to cost in excess of £1 million.  I will ask the Minister to bear in mind what the Deputies have said about the need for this scheme when drawing up the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme.  The Deputies will be aware that there are very many schemes around the country competing for the available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday I gave notice of my intention to raise the arbitrary and illegal removal or reduction of the Christmas bonus by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs from recipients of supplementary welfare allowance and the urgent need to countermand the circular to that effect issued on 27 November. I am very glad the Minister did that yesterday and my main objective in raising this matter has been achieved.  The number of recipients involved was estimated at 10,000 by health board sources and they will receive their Christmas bonuses.  They will have money to buy Christmas fare and put something under the tree for their children.  I am delighted the approach I adopted has achieved its fundamental objective and that the result has been so satisfactory from that point of view.</P>
      <P>However, there are still outstanding issues. Why was this circular issued?  The amount of savings involved would have been £1 million in a week where there was a budget surplus of £1 billion.  How could the Minister stand over a circular, which would have the effect of saving £1 million at most, by taking the Christmas bite of the mouths of the most needy people?  There seemed to be an effort to talk about standardisation. Does the Minister accept that the basis of supplementary welfare is that there must be flexibility to enable officials to deal with the needs of the worst off in society?  Does he further accept that under section 226 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, he does not have the ultimate power to direct what should be done? The deciding officer is the chief executive officer of the health board and on that basis the legality of the instruction that issued is doubtful.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to deal with the question of political responsibility.  It appears the Minister now admits he was unaware of the circular.  How could an official have authority to issue a circular with such devastating effects on the lives of people without the knowledge of the Minister? That issue needs to be resolved, if only to make sure it does not happen again.  There is also the question of the reaction to this issue last Friday. When I drew the matter to public attention in an effort to have it resolved the reaction of the Minister was odd.  He did not stand up and say he had made a mistake and would sort it out.  I would have accepted that but he sent out an official to bat for him and justify the circular.  The Minister sent out an official who issued a statement to the effect that the Department said that people would not receive double supplementary welfare cheques in the Eastern and Southern Health Board areas because they were out of step with practices elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister justify doing that when it was brought to his attention if only by the Opposition spokesperson?  He followed up later by accusing me of &ldquo;uncaring political opportunism&rdquo; for raising the issue.  Did he expect me to lie down and let these people do without their <Col N="125" /> Christmas bonuses?  Is he aware that on Thursday last in the health board office in Tralee there was a public disturbance to which the Garda had to be called, because supplementary welfare recipients were told that they were not getting their bonuses.  They were handed a copy of the departmental circular.  Does he accept that it was proper for an Opposition spokesperson to ensure that the issue was resolved?</P>
    <P>How did it happen and how can it be ensured that it will not happen again?  I can probably tell the Minister how it happened.  Approximately ten years ago a previous Minister for Social Welfare set up a supplementary welfare allowance advisory committee and I want to challenged the Minister on this.  This committee met monthly until 1997 and I am advised that it has not met for more than 12 months.  The essence of good management is communication and when the Department and the health boards are involved it would be suitable to have a meeting to discuss and sort out these problems or at least to be aware of them.  I am convinced the cause of the problem was that the committee was not meeting.  Does the Minister know about this committee?</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with supplementary welfare allowances we are not talking about buttons. We are talking about more than £200 million, which is twice the entire budget of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, much greater than that of the Department of Public Enterprise and more than twice that of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  The budget is greater than that of the Revenue Commissioners and ten times that of the Department of the Taoiseach, yet the Minister presides over a situation in which the advisory committee for that budget does not meet.  I challenge him on this &mdash; is it correct that the committee has not met for 12 months?  If that is so, he has a substantial case to answer and the problems he has had to date are as nothing compared to those which will emerge in the future unless he changes his approach and provides for proper management in his Department.  It is his responsibility to ensure that.</P>

      <P>Christmas bonus payments are provided by my Department to people in receipt of certain long-term social welfare payments, such as old age pension, widow's pension, long-term unemployment assistance, one parent family payment, invalidity pension and certain other long-term payments.  The amount paid is 70 per <Col N="126" /> cent of the basic weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20.  The Christmas bonus is paid to people on these long-term payments regardless of the length of time they have been in receipt of the payment in question.</P>
      <P>Some 715,000 people will automatically receive Christmas bonus payments this year, at a cost of about £40 million.  These payments are not and never were affected by anything in the circular issued to the health boards, to which the Deputy refers.  Health boards are empowered, and indeed obliged, to make once-off payments to people who are faced with an exceptional need, including the additional costs which arise at Christmas time.  These exceptional needs payments, commonly known as ENPs, are made to people in need not just at Christmas time but at other times of the year as well.  This year, the health boards will spend about £20 million on ENPs.</P>
      <P>Health boards have responded over the years to the needs of people at Christmas time by making SWA exceptional needs payments.  However, practice has evolved differently in the eight health boards, giving rise to anomalies, inequitable treatment of people in similar financial circumstances and a failure to make payments in some instances to people who were entitled to additional financial assistance.  One feature adopted in seven of the eight health boards is the payment of a standard amount to certain categories of SWA recipients.  This was done for administrative reasons.  The standard amount paid differed from health board to health board, as did the criteria that applied as to who would get a payment.  In one health board, there was inconsistency even within the region in how the scheme was administered.</P>
      <P>The circular issued by my Department on 27 November related solely to the treatment of these standardised payments within the ENP system.  I reject absolutely and completely the allegation that issuing the circular is in any way arbitrary or illegal, and dismiss the Deputy's blustering in this regard.  There is specific legislative provision for giving general direction and control to the health boards in relation to the SWA scheme.  The purpose of that instruction was to ensure that people receiving these standardised payments are treated in an equal, fair and consistent manner, in line with the operation of the Christmas bonus in schemes administered by the Department, regardless of which health board deals with their case.  It is wrong that some people are denied payments because they happen to live in one particular area while people in exactly the same circumstances living elsewhere receive a payment.  There is no justification for such anomalies in the welfare system.  I expect Deputy O'Keeffe would wholeheartedly agree with our efforts to rid the system of these anomalies.</P>

      <P>One consequence of the circular is that hundreds of people who are in receipt of SWA on an interim basis while awaiting a long-term payment such as one parent family payment or old age pension will now get an additional payment of SWA in time for Christmas which they would not have received under the arrangements that were previously in place.  I am happy this is the case and expect Deputy O'Keeffe is as well. That would have been the position under the original circular.</P>
      <P>In view of the misinformation surrounding this issue, further instructions were issued to the health boards on 7 December 1998 to clarify various points which had been made in the preceding days.  The second circular made abundantly clear that, first, boards must be satisfied no person is left without an adequate SWA payment if his or her means are insufficient to meet his or her needs, including additional needs arising at this time of year; and second, boards are not limited to making standardised payments to meet the additional needs which people have at this time of year and were not included under the previous circular.  All of this is perfectly clear to anybody who understands the operation of the exceptional needs system, unlike the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Some pensioners, long-term unemployed and disabled people were misled and upset by the misinformation generated on this issue, as they mistakenly believed that their entitlements were being reduced.  Preying on the fears of vulnerable people is a cheap political stunt unworthy of even the laziest Opposition spokesman.  It is no coincidence that Fine Gael resorted to this desperate attempt to drum up publicity for themselves on Thursday last, as they had nothing else to say following the successful budget introduced last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I put on record again that there is no reduction in the Christmas bonus this year.  The only party which ever reduced the Christmas bonus was Fine Gael, which cut the bonus twice.  I have no doubt Deputy O'Keeffe was a member of those Governments, which were led by the great social democrat himself, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  I have not reduced the Christmas bonus, nor have I or the Government any intention of reducing it. There are no cutbacks.  The position is better under this Government.</P>

Since my visit, BIM has followed up with repeat trips in conjunction with Irish seafood exporters to sustain identified opportunities for Irish seafood.  Trade has already got under way in live shellfish products, notably crab.</P>
      <P>There will shortly be a return trade visit of Chinese seafood companies to Ireland to meet the Irish seafood export interests.  I am satisfied that the sustained marketing effort by BIM and the industry will ensure a strong niche for Irish seafood in the Chinese market.  My Department and BIM are also represented on the Asia Strategy Group which was established by the Taoiseach to advise Government on a long-term market development strategy for the Asia region and China.</P>
      <P>Eastern Europe is an important focus of BIM marketing strategy for pelagic products in particular. As the Deputy knows, international markets are currently very depressed for herring and mackerel largely due to the collapse of the Russian economy and the recession in Japan.  BIM is working closely with Irish fish exporters to develop market openings in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania.  Market investigation visits to Romania in particular have resulted in expanding trade opportunities on that front.</P>
      <P>BIM has also extended its network of contact in the Baltic region through involvement in an EU programme to develop contact between the seafood trade in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and EU producers, including the Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Along with ongoing initiatives in these markets, BIM is working at my request, to develop a comprehensive multi-annual seafood export market strategy.  A key element in this strategy will be to maximise the benefits of co-operation with Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia in key overseas locations.</P>

      <P>At my request preliminary research on the fishery has been undertaken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute.  Work is continuing on a range of issues, notably the extent and location of stocks and spawning season.  My Department is working closely with both agencies to develop and put in place the research and management strategies required to support the sustainable exploitation in the interests of the fishermen themselves and the long-term future of the resource.</P>

      <P>I have decided to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards for a further year to enable me to complete my review of the inland fisheries services and implement the necessary legislation to underpin appropriate <Col N="132" /> organisational and operational changes over the coming months.  The postponement will mean that the elections to the boards are now scheduled for December 1999.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to secure the future of this very valuable and unique resource it is critical to address in a comprehensive manner, for once and for all, the difficulties and problems that have detracted from the effective operation of the boards and generally inhibited the development of the fisheries.  It is my intention to announce early in the new year the changes I propose to implement and an opportunity will be provided in this House to discuss them in detail.</P>
      <P>My review will address the operational and structural arrangements of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  I am in particular concerned about the relative roles and responsibilities of boards to ensure that the services are delivered in a more effective and efficient manner.  A second concern of mine is to ensure that the composition of the boards adequately reflects both the interests of those with a direct involvement in the fisheries as well as the wider public desire for the optimum development of the inland fisheries resources, particularly in our major catchments. As part of the review I am also examining a number of other issues affecting the long-term development of the sector, including planning and reporting process, and accountability and resource allocation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss any further details of the review at this time until I have completed my considerations, but as I have said, there will be an occasion for further discussion in the coming months.</P>

      <P>My Department plays an important role in maritime and water based safety with the goal of preventing as far as possible the loss of life at sea by establishing and enforcing high safety standards and providing effective emergency response services.</P>
      <P>My key objectives in this area are to ensure that vessels meet accepted international safety standards; to improve marine safety culture and awareness; and to ensure the provision of an efficient and effective marine emergency service.</P>
      <P>In regard to the latter objective, I have recently extended the remit of the Irish Marine Emergency Service to include inland waters and I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government with a view to developing the service into a coastguard.</P>
      <P>The main strategies in place to achieve these objectives are adopting and implementing updated safety rules and regulations in accordance with accepted international standards; supporting the adoption of high international safety standards by the International Maritime Organisation, the EU and other international organisations; developing and using the services of my Department's Marine Survey Office and the Marine Radio Surveyors' Office to survey vessels and enforce standards; promoting marine safety, in association with other safety agencies and sectoral and voluntary groups; providing a marine emergency service through public and voluntary bodies, the co-ordination of those services and co-operation with other states in the operation of emergency services; co-ordinating with other services including the Garda, hospitals, etc.  in relation to major accident response plan; and the provision of a range of navigational aids and communication network.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that this approach is an essential component of the national and international strategy to advance maritime safety, my Department is not primarily concerned with the provision and maintenance of safety facilities (other than those needed for the rescue services) on the northside of Dublin Bay or elsewhere throughout the country.  Safety facilities are the responsibility of those authorities and organisations charged with the management and development of discrete land, shore and water based areas and resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the implications for fishing vessels, Council Directive 97/70/EC requires that specific categories of fishing vessels of 24 metres <Col N="135" /> in length and over will, in accordance with Chapter IX of the Torremolinos Protocol, have to install full Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) radiocommunications equipment appropriate to their sea area of operation with effect from 1 January 1999 in respect of new fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over and from 1 February 1999 in respect of existing fishing vessels of 45 metres in length and over.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>A report on the investigation of the loss of the fishing vessel <i>Carrickatine</i>, undertaken by the Marine Survey Office of my Department, was published on Monday, 9 November 1998.</P>
      <P>While this report sets out fully the efforts made to investigate this tragic incident, sufficient evidence has not been found to enable the investigation to establish the cause of this terrible tragedy.</P>
      <P>The principal findings of the report are as follows: it has not been possible to establish what caused the loss of the <i>Carrickatine</i> as there is insufficient evidence to support any theory which might explain her loss; it concludes that the likelihood was that the vessel was lost very quickly with the crew having insufficient time to use the liferafts or lifesaving appliances; while no trace of the vessel or her crew has been found to date, some debris, identified as coming from the <i>Carrickatine</i>, was recovered but did not reveal any information on the possible location of the vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report makes recommendations aimed at improving the general safety of fishing vessels. Chief among these is the introduction of comprehensive <Col N="136" /> legislation to cover the construction, stability and equipment (including radio) requirements, for fishing vessels of all sizes.  It also recommends, as a matter of priority, that the fitting of emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) be made mandatory on all but the smallest of inshore fishing vessels.  The beacons emit radio signals when activated or on contact with water.  The fitting of liferafts should also be mandatory on all fishing vessels and they should be secured by hydrostatic release units so they can float-free in the event of the vessels sinking.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches particular priority to the issue of fishing vessel safety and I am taking steps to ensure accelerated progress with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group, particularly in the area of fleet development.  This group was established following the tragic loss of the <i>Carrickatine.</i>  The programme being pursued following the review group's report of May 1996 is as follows.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group indicated that in the absence of incentives for the renewal of the fleet there would be little improvement in the age structure and safety status of the fleet.  Accordingly, I have given top priority to the introduction of the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet.  The programme involves a grant aid support scheme and tax incentives are provided for in the 1998 Finance Act.  The programme is designed to promote investment in the whitefish fleet with the introduction of a number of new and modern second-hand vessels into the fleet. In this connection, I recently approved over £12 million in State-EU grant and aid supporting investment of over £50 million for the introduction of 31 new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  I propose to shortly announce funding towards a number of modern second-hand vessels.  In addition, a targeted modernisation scheme and support for essential safety equipment for vessels will modernise the vessels in the fleet and contribute to improved safety.</P>
    <P>I would, in particular, draw the attention of the Deputy to the vessel safety equipment scheme under that programme, which provided for grant aid of 50 per cent for the purchase and fitting of essential safety gear.  I have announced three rounds of approvals to date under this scheme.  I consider this vessel safety equipment scheme to be of vital importance.  The aim of this scheme is to encourage vessel owners to fit out vessels with specific on-board safety equipment.  Improved safety equipment on board vessels can play a vital part in the ongoing battle to protect life at sea; the recent tragedies at sea bring home to us all the perilous working conditions that fishermen endure.</P>
    <P>I am generally very pleased at the high level of interest in the programme for renewal of the whitefish fleet.  It underlines the appetite and need for reinvestment in the fleet right around the coast and confirms that the incentives on offer are proving attractive to a wide range of fishermen. <Col N="137" /> I would, nevertheless, strongly encourage fishermen to avail of this unique funding opportunity to install vital safety equipment.  I am determined to ensure that the scheme fully delivers on the Government's objectives to revitalise the whitefish fleet and to support safety, jobs and competitiveness in the sector to the benefit of our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by the review group at the number of unregistered fishing vessels operating in Irish waters, many of which are small and in poor condition.  The group considered that these vessels constitute a serious threat to safety and recommended that this situation be addressed.  Under a special scheme approved by the European Commission, the position of previously unregistered vessels in the fishing fleet is being regularised.  Over 600 of some 900 applications under the scheme have been approved for a licence and it is hoped that all of the remaining applications will be processed by the end of this year.  The criteria under this scheme for registration require, among other matters, that vessels undergo a condition survey report in order to ensure that the vessel is safe and seaworthy.  This represents a significant improvement in our safety regulatory framework and in our safety standards for small fishing vessels in particular.</P>
    <P>Safety training, which is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews in the event of an accident at sea, continues to be provided in an accessible manner through BIM's two mobile training units in response to demand at various locations around the coast.  In addition, the construction of a new fisheries training centre in Castletownbere is nearing completion.  The centre, which will deliver safety skills instruction to fishermen in the south coast region, is targeted to be operational in early 1999.  The principal objective of BIM's coastal training programme is to generate a health and safety culture within the small scale fishing sector in particular.</P>
    <P>Funding under the EU's Small Scale Coastal Fisheries Programme has been secured towards a new training initiative aimed at the spouses and families of small scale coastal fishermen.  It is hoped that the relatives of fishermen can exert a positive influence in the promotion of good safety practices on board small fishing vessels.  This pilot initiative, which is being run by BIM in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, Comharcumann Inis Méain Teo.  and Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, will target 12 venues over the course of 18 months.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the field of onshore marine radio communications. My Department's Irish Marine Emergency Service has arranged for the installation of new medium frequency transmitters at Rosslare and Belmullet with enhanced radio coverage and improved emergency response for fishing vessels operating in the Irish Sea and off the north west coast.  In addition, my Department has recently placed a contract for the installation of VHF digital selective calling (DSC) equipment at coast <Col N="138" /> radio stations and other VHF sites around the coast and this work is due for completion at the end of next year.  Ireland will then be in a position to declare an enhanced area (known as an A1 + A2 Sea Area), under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), which will facilitate automatic distress signal reception from vessels fitted with VHF DSC working in or transiting our search and rescue area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The review group identified a need for a substantial improvement in safety awareness among Irish fishermen.  In recognition of this requirement, my Department's marine safety working group has published three practical information booklets specifically for fishing vessels.  These user-friendly publications deal with machinery failure, man overboard procedures and emergency procedures.  Furthermore, it is intended to shortly publish GMDSS guidelines for small boat users, including fishermen, in European waters. The promulgation of this series of safety information booklets can play an important part in fostering an ethos of safety consciousness in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ongoing improvements in the areas of fleet development, safety training, on-shore marine radio communications and safety awareness, a programme is under way to underpin the development of a safety culture in the fishing sector through the introduction of the comprehensive safety regulations recommended by the review group.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the proposed safety regulations governing fishing vessels is well under way.  Regulations have already been drafted to implement European Council Directive 97/70/EC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.  These regulations, which are currently being finalised by the Attorney General's office, cover, <i>inter alia</i>, construction, stability, machinery, fire protection, life-saving appliances and radio communications. Vessels under 24 metres in length will also be addressed by the introduction of regulations for appropriate size categories of smaller vessels operating out of our fishing ports.</P>
    <P>Draft radio rules have also been prepared, specifying the radio communications equipment, including emergency position indicating radio beacons, to be carried on all sizes of fishing vessels. I propose to introduce these rules, which are currently being finalised, at an early date.  I also intend to bring in new regulations for the crews of fishing vessels, which will cover safety training and increased manning requirements, in line with the review group's recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the context of health and safety in the workplace, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), is to shortly introduce regulations to give effect to European Council Directive 93/103/EC on the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels. <Col N="139" /> These regulations, which are being prepared in consultation with my Department, will provide for its joint implementation by the HSA and my Department, having regard to respective areas of competence.</P>
    <P>My Department, and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, together with the Health and Safety Authority where appropriate, will continue, in partnership with the fishing industry, to implement the safety programme outlined above.  Our shared objective is to ensure that the priority now given to improving and maintaining safety standards will continue as a permanent and integral part of the management of our fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I have already accepted the general thrust and content of the recently published report of the investigation of Marine Casualties Policy Review Group which was set up to review the existing policy, procedures and legislative framework for maritime casualty investigation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The key recommendation of the review group is the establishment of an independent marine casualty investigation board, with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to expeditiously publish reports of the board's findings.</P>
    <P>Drafting of a Bill to introduce the required legislative framework to implement this key recommendation is under way in my Department and I intend bringing proposals to Government in the new year.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have provided financial assistance in the current year to Waterford County Council towards some works at Helvick.</P>
      <P>My Department has, to date, received no current proposals from the local authority for works at Helvick.</P>
      <P>Any proposals which the local authority wishes to put forward will be considered carefully having regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to available funding mechanisms and overall infrastructure investment priorities.</P>

      <P>Analysis of the data for whitefish landings 1995 to date, for the primary whitefish fishing period January to October shows a fairly constant level of catch over this timeframe.  While there have been marginal changes in the overall level of landings from year to year, there is no pattern of significant reductions.</P>
      <P>The key challenges for the whitefish sector are quality and continuity of supply.  The whitefish fleet renewal programme is supporting the introduction of 31 new whitefish vessels into the fleet as well as investment in modern secondhand tonnage and modernisation projects.  This programme is designed to deliver improved quality, competitiveness and continuity of whitefish supply, increased landings and better prices.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is the October 1998 edition of the North West Europe Upstream Report, which contained an article about the Corrib gas discovery.  This was published by Wood Mackenzie and they have provided my Department with a copy of the article.  They state that they believe that the field can already be regarded as commercial.  However, on the basis of the data acquired by the licensees the Corrib gas accumulation cannot be regarded as commercial at this time.  It is not known with any precision how much gas is in place or how it is situated physically or how it would be accessed. It is likely that two or three more years' assessment will be required before a full appraisal is completed.  Only at that stage can it be determined whether the field is commercial.  If so, it is then likely to take two further years to carry out development and bring the field into production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and services and indeed Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate <Col N="141" /> in such activities.  In that context, as the Deputy is aware, my Department has written to both SIPTU and the IOOA urging them to discuss the problem of employment in offshore exploration with the intention of arriving at an acceptable solution.  The IOOA has requested a meeting with me in advance of any such discussions and I have agreed to meet them.  I have previously had discussions with SIPTU on this issue and am quite happy to have further such discussions.</P>
    <P>I should add that Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration operations.</P>
    <P>They have been very active in this area for some time and have assisted the operators in identifying Irish companies who can tender for work and have assisted companies by identifying opportunities that are arising in both petroleum exploration and production.</P>

      <P>Under the Government's programme for renewal of the whitefish fleet, grant aid is available for improving the overall safety standard of the fleet.  The programme provides grant aid of 50 per cent of the eligible cost of the purchase and fitting of safety equipment.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for funding under this scheme is based on the following criteria: (a) the items of safety equipment selected for purchase and fitting must be from a specified list.  This list includes emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRB) and (b) the vessel which is being fitted with the safety items is sound, seaworthy, and must comply with statutory life saving and fire fighting regulations.</P>
      <P>To date, there have been three tranches of approvals for vessel safety applicants.  These amount to a total cost of £131,211.77 in funding, £59,050.45 of which, is EU grant aided.  I will announce further approvals of grant aid for the purchase of safety equipment under the programme and would encourage the maximum number of fishermen to avail of this scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provision of grant aid for EPIRB's, I propose at an early date to introduce new rules, which will make mandatory the carriage of EPIRB's and other radio communications equipment on all fishing vessels and provide for strict enforcement through regular inspections of the radio communications equipment at an early date.</P>

I welcome the fact that this man has decided to put this information into the public domain.  I understand that members of the task force have now met him to discuss the matter and that further inquiries are being made on foot of his information.  My officials have also been in touch with the UK authorities to advise them of these allegations and to ask that they be investigated.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the task force as soon as it has had an opportunity to assess this new information.  As I have previously indicated, it is my intention to publish the report of the task force.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 71 together as these are identical.</P>
      <P>I presume the issue to which the Deputies refer is the implementation, in Irish law, of the provisions of the 1988 Protocol relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.</P>
      <P>My Department has prepared a draft statutory instrument to give full effect to the provisions of the 1988 Protocol.  These draft regulations are currently being settled in the Attorney General's Office, and I intend to introduce them once settlement has been completed by that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these regulations are in place, giving the terms of the 1988 Protocol full effect in national law, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Protocol. I propose to then pursue this course of <Col N="143" /> action with the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has responsbility for such matters.</P>

      <P>Data from BIM, shows that, based on 1996 figures, the total farm gate value of rope mussels was £3.375 million which had an estimated value added to the national economy at point of first sale of £3.1 million.  The gross output of rope mussels at secondary stage was £9.24 million with a value added to the economy of £5.415 million.  This represents a total value added to the economy of £8.515 million.</P>
      <P>Approximately 75 per cent of the rope mussel industry is based in the south west, with the remaining farms located in areas such as Mulroy Bay, Clew Bay and Killary Harbour.  Processing of rope mussels is undertaken in Cork, Mayo and Donegal.</P>
      <P>The bottom culture of mussels features strongly in Carlingford Lough, Wexford Harbour, Waterford Harbour, Cromane Harbour, Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle.  In 1997 over 10,000 tonnes of bottom culture mussels were produced giving a farm gate value of £3.2 million with a value added to the economy of an estimated £2.71 million.  An indicative annual return per hectare of foreshore is £14,000 for both rope and bottom mussel cultivation which significantly exceeds the return from agriculture.</P>

      <P>Following a procedure which included the preparation and publication of an <Col N="145" /> Environmental Impact Statement, a licence was granted in May 1997 to extract a maximum of 800,000m 3 of sand and gravel from the foreshore in Cork Harbour for use as backfill in the Lee Tunnel.  Due to delays which subsequently arose the licensee was unable to complete the extraction work by the end of 1997, as specified in the licence, and had to submit a further application to extract up to 200,000m 3.  Notice of this application was published in <i>The Examiner</i> in July 1998.  The applicant has since reduced the amount sought to be extracted to 10,000m 3.  Examination of the case has recently been completed and I hope to be in a position to make a decision very soon on the application.</P>
      <P>An application was received to extract marine aggregates from an area south of Waterford Harbour. Notice of this application was published in July 1998 and an EIS was put on public display. My Department's specialists are currently examining objections (including those which refer to the herring and shellfish fisheries) which were received together with the applicant's comments thereon.  I will take all aspects of the matter into account when coming to a decision in this case.</P>
      <P>Bray Urban District Council plan to remove gravel from the Codling Bank to be used for coastal protection works at Bray.  Approval under the Foreshore Acts followed preparation and publication of an EIS and examination of objections. The proposed dredge area is 0.255 Km 2 out of a total area of 200 Km 2 i.e. 1 800th of the area in question. Mindful of the concerns of fishermen, however, I have instructed that Bray UDC should ensure that adequate notice is given to allow for the removal of whelks from the proposed dredge area prior to dredging commencing.  A liaison arrangement has been provided to ensure that the concerns of fishermen continue to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Department has received a number of applications and inquiries in relation to possible extraction of sand and gravel off the east coast. As these applications involve potentially much larger areas than those previously considered, and conscious of the need to examine them thoroughly and equitably, having regard to the competing interests of applicants in addition to issues such as the marine environment, fisheries and navigation, it is considered necessary to first establish a framework which takes account of different statutory and policy requirements.  This involves extensive consultation both within my Department and with other Departments and agencies.  This process has commenced.</P>

      <P>The forest inventory and planning system is a highly developed computer based information platform which has succeeded in identifying the national forest estate to within accuracies of 99 per cent.  The recent inventory has disclosed the national forest estate to be 606,000 hectares.  This figure is in line with the expected total forest cover for the country.  An area of around 4,000 hectares, however, was identified in the inventory which was not included in earlier inventories.  The maximum potential value of this area would be approximately £20,000 per hectare.  The total estimated value of the additional forest estate on this basis would at a maximum be £80 million.  The system, which lends itself to constant updating will be capable of producing accurate statistics on forest cover well into the new millennium.  It is also noteworthy that this inventory showed the proportion of broadleaved forests is now 21 per cent, 1 per cent above previous inventories.</P>

      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, governs the opening of retail establishments. The Act provides for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gave the Minister power by order to add to the list of exempted business, or to exempt specifed regions from the provisions of the Act.  However, an order made later that year (1938) exempted the whole country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position to the present day.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the replies to Questions Nos. 69 and 70 on 1 December 1998 on related matters.</P>

      <P>Although the British scheme has been endorsed by the British Government, it is a private sector initiative involving the UK Federation of Small Businesses and Internet providers.  While I have no plans to offer free Internet access to small firms, I am aware that one of the small business representative organisations in this country has an initiative, in conjunction with two Internet providers, which gives 90 days free access and subsequent discount rates for members.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is possible for companies to make details of their products and services available on the Enterprise Ireland and National Software Directorate web sites and on the web sites which have been set up by some of the county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of lowcost Internet access as emphasised by the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications in their recent report.  The primary means by which competitive Internet access prices will be developed in the Irish market will be through the development of a regulatory framework which promotes effective competition.  I am liaising closely with my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, regarding any developments in this area.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note the price reductions for Internet access recently announced by Telecom Éireann and I look forward to the introduction of a flat rate access in January next.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind Irish standard IS.  91 (1983) which relates to clay bricks.  The specific data sought by the Deputy is not available from the Central Statistics Office.  However the statistics on clay bricks are included with those for building blocks.</P>
      <P>In 1997 a total volume of 33,928,485kg (value IR£1,369,188) of building blocks and clay bricks was imported, with 33,384,669kg (IR£926,268) being imported from Northern Ireland.

      <P>The State, acting primarily through its agencies, supports the establishment or expansion of businesses, as provided for in legislation, the main expression of which is the Industrial Development Act, 1986, as amended.  The primary role of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this area is to contribute to the formulation of Government policy and to ensure the Department and its agencies implement that policy in an efficient and effective manner.  The Minister also plays a major role in ensuring that the investment climate and broad business environment is conducive to the establishment and expansion of enterprises and that the labour force is well trained and flexible and operates in a properly regulated environment. I am also concerned to ensure that the labour force is properly incentivised through reform of the tax system.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present processing eight applications for aquaculture licences to engage in mussel farming in Dunmanus Bay. The applications are being considered in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997.  This legislation, and regulations made under it, provide a thorough and fully transparent mechanism for the processing of aquaculture licence applications.  The legislation provides that the legitimate interests of all parties who may be affected by any proposed aquaculture operations are fully taken into account in the licensing process.</P>
      <P>Following initial scrutiny of the applications by the Department, the public consultation process was initiated and the views of a number of relevant agencies were formally requested.  These included: The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; An Bord Iascaigh Mhara; The Marine Institute; Cork County Council; Bord Fáilte; the Central Fisheries Board; the South Western Regional Fisheries Board; the Commissioners of Irish Lights, and An Taisce. The general public was informed of the proposed operations by advertisements placed in local newspapers which advised that detailed maps of the proposed operations were available for inspection in the local Garda station.  The advertisements also invited interested parties to make submissions or observations to my Department on the proposals if they so wished.</P>
      <P>A number of submissions have been received in the Department and have been referred to the applicants for comment.  The submissions received and the responses of the applicants will be carefully considered before any decision is made in relation to the grant of licences.  As the Deputy may also be aware, under the terms of the current legislation, there is a statutory obligation to publish all licensing decisions.  Within a period of one calendar month of publication, any person may appeal a decision, either to grant or to refuse a licence, to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, an independent board established under the legislation to consider and rule upon appeals which may be lodged against licence decisions.</P>

      <P>One well was drilled this year &mdash; an appraisal well about 70 kilometres west of Achill.  The well was successfully tested and a flow of gas was measured at a stabilised rate of 63 million standard cublic feet per day.  The test indicated that favourable production rates can be achieved from the discovery.  It is not known with any precision how much gas is in place or how it is situated physically or how it would be assessed.  It is likely that two or three more years' assessment will be required for a full appraisal.  Only at that stage can it be determined whether the field is commercial. If so, it is then likely to take two further years to carry out development and bring the field into production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches a particular priority to the issue of fishing vessel safety and I am taking steps to ensure accelerated progress with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group, particularly in the area of fleet development.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Whitefish Fleet Renewal</i>
      </P>
      <P>The report of the review group indicated that in the absence of incentives for the renewal of the fleet there would be little improvement in the age structure and safety status of the fleet.  Accordingly, I have given top priority to the introduction of the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet.  The programme involves a grant aid support scheme and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet.  The tax incentives are provided for in the Finance Act, 1998.  The programme is designed to promote investment in the whitefish fleet with the introduction of a number of new and modern second-hand vessels into the fleet.  In this connection, I recently approved over £12 million in State-EU grant aid supporting investment of over £50 million for the introduction of 31 new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  I propose to shortly announce funding towards a number of modern second-hand vessels.  In addition, a targeted modernisation scheme and support for essential safety equipment for vessels will modernise the vessels in the fleet and contribute to improved safety.</P>
      <P>I would, in particular, draw the attention of the Deputy to the veseel safety equipment scheme under that programme, which provides for grant aid of 50 per cent for the purchase and fitting of essential safety gear.  I have announced three rounds of approvals to date under this scheme.  I consider this vessel safety equipment scheme to be of vital importance.  The aim of this scheme is to encourage vessel owners to fit out vessels with specific on-board safety equipment.  Improved safety equipment on board vessels can play a vital part in the ongoing battle to protect life at sea; the recent tragedies at sea bring home to us all the perilous working conditions that fishermen endure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am generally pleased at the high level of interest in the programme for renewal of the whitefish fleet.  It underlines the appetite and need for reinvestment in the fleet right around the coast and confirms that the incentives on offer are proving attractive to a wide range of fishermen. I would nevertheless strongly encourage fishermen to avail of this unique funding opportunity to install vital safety equipment.  I am determined to ensure that the scheme fully <Col N="159" /> delivers on the Government's objectives to revitalise the whitefish fleet and to support safety, jobs and competitiveness in the sector to the benefit of our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by the review group at the number of unregistered fishing vessels operating in Irish waters, many of which are small and in poor condition.  The group considered that these vessels constitute a serious threat to safety and recommended that this situation be addressed.  Under a special scheme approved by the European Commission, the position of previously unregistered vessels in the fishing fleet is being regularised.  Over 600 of some 900 applications under the scheme have been approved for a licence and it is hoped that all of the remaining applications will be processed by the end of this year.  The criteria under this scheme for registration require, among other matters, that vessels undergo a condition survey report in order to ensure that the vessel is safe and seaworthy.  This represents a significant improvement in our safety regulatory framework and in our safety standards for small fishing vessels in particular.</P>
    <P>Safety training, which is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews in the event of an accident at sea, continues to be provided in an accessible manner through BIM's two mobile training units in response to demand at various locations around the coast.  In addition, the construction of a new fisheries training centre in Castletownbere is nearing completion.  The centre, which will deliver safety skills instruction to fishermen in the south coast region, is targeted to be operational in early 1999.  The principal objective of BIM's coastal training programme is to generate a health and safety culture within the small scale fishing sector in particular.</P>
    <P>Funding under the EU's small scale coastal fisheries programme has been secured towards a new training initiative aimed at the spouses and families of small scale coastal fishermen.  It is hoped that the relatives of fishermen can exert a positive influence in the promotion of good safety practices on board small fishing vessels.  This pilot initiative, which is being run by BIM in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, Comharcumann Inis Meain Teoranta and Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, will target 12 venues over the course of 18 months.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the field of on-shore marine radio communications. My Department's Irish marine emergency service has arranged for the installation of new medium frequency transmitters at Rosslare and Belmullet with enhanced radio coverage and improved emergency response for fishing vessels operating in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast.  In addition, my Department has recently placed a contract for the installation of VHF digital selective calling, or DSC, equipment at coast radio stations and other VHF sites around the coast and this work is due for completion at the end of next year.  Ireland will then be in a position <Col N="160" /> to declare an enhanced area, known as an A1 + A2 sea area, under the global maritime distress and safety system, or GMDSS, which will facilitate automatic distress signal reception from vessels fitted with VHF DSC working in or transiting our search and rescue area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The review group identified a need for a substantial improvement in safety awareness among Irish fishermen.  In recognition of this requirement, my Department's marine safety working group has published three practical information booklets specifically for fishing vessels.  These user-friendly publications deal with machinery failure, man overboard procedures and emergency procedures . Furthermore, it is intended to shortly publish GMDSS guidelines for small boat users, including fishermen, in European waters. The promulgation of this series of safety information booklets can play an important part in fostering an ethos of safety consciousness in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As to regulation and legal sanction, notwithstanding the ongoing improvements in the areas of fleet development, safety training, on-shore marine radio communications and safety awareness, a programme is under way to underpin the development of a safety culture in the fishing sector through the introduction of the comprehensive safety regulations recommended by the review group.  The preparation of the proposed safety regulations governing fishing vessels is well under way.  Regulations have already been drafted to implement European Council Directive 97/70/EC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.  These regulations, which are currently being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General, cover, <i>inter alia,</i> construction, stability, machinery, fire protection, life-saving appliances and radio communications.  Vessels under 24 metres in length will also be addressed by the introduction of regulations for appropriate size categories of smaller vessels operating out of our fishing ports.</P>
    <P>Draft radio rules have also been prepared, specifying the radio communications equipment, including emergency position indicating radio beacons, to be carried on all sizes of fishing vessels. I propose to introduce these rules, which are currently being finalised, at an early date.  I also intend to bring in new regulations for the crews of fishing vessels, which will cover safety training and increased manning requirements, in line with the review group's recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the context of health and safety in the workplace, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, is to shortly introduce regulations to give effect to European Council Directive 93/103/EC on the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels.  These regulations which are being prepared in consultation with my Department, will provide for its joint <Col N="161" /> implementation by the HSA and my Department, having regard to respective areas of competence.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, together with the Health and Safety Authority where appropriate, will continue, in partnership with the fishing industry, to implement the safety programme outlined above.  Our shared objective is to ensure that the priority now given to improving and maintaining safety standards will continue as a permanent and integral part of the management of our fishing fleet.</P>

These requirements relate to: name of product; quantity of characterising ingredients; ingredients list; net quantity; use by date; storage conditions and instructions for use; and name and address of manufacturer or packer.</P>
      <P>No specific provisions are made as to the labelling of wild versus farmed salmon.  Provisions are made to ensure that misleading statements or claims are not made as to the characteristics of the foodstuff, quantity, origin or provenance, method of manufacture or production.  I am advised by BIM that this is intended to prevent, for example, labelling claims of farmed salmon as wild salmon.  Both may be labelled as salmon.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any significant problem in this area but if the Deputy has specific concerns he should take these up with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who has responsibility for the rules on the labelling of food.  The policing of these requirements is a matter for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 104, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The fish farm at Lough Allen is operated by Gaelic Seafoods (Ireland) Ltd., which is the holder of a licence granted on 10 August 1995. Regular inspections of both freshwater (land based) sites and marine finfish farms are carried out by my Department's engineering division under the Department's fish farm inspection programme to ensure compliance with all licence conditions.  A recent inspection of the Lough Allen farm showed satisfactory compliance with all of the licence conditions.  The fish health division of the Marine Institute also carry out regular inspections of land based fish farms.  A recent such inspection showed the fish to be healthy. The licence is available for public inspection on request at my Department's headquarters in Leeson Lane.  Gaelic Seafoods is permitted to have in possession at any time 1 million salmon smolts having a biomass not exceeding 50 tonnes.</P>
      <P>As regards production levels, in addition to the licence condition which stipulates maximum permitted production levels-fish stocks, licensees are required to furnish a production plan for their proposed inputs of fish to the farm.  In the interests of transparency, licensees are also required to seek permits from my Department for the transfer of smolts to production sites.  This provides a further means of monitoring adherence on the part of licensed operators to the stipulated production levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of the licence granted to Gaelic Seafoods that the State is indemnified against all <Col N="164" /> actions, loss, claims, damages, costs expenses and demands arising in any manner whatsoever in connection with the construction, maintenance or use of any aquaculture structures, apparatus or equipment or in the exercise of the rights granted under licence.</P>
    <P>In addition, Gaelic Seafoods is legally obliged to report to the Department and the fish health unit in the fisheries research centre of the Marine Institute within 48 hours of the appearance of any disease or abnormal losses or mortalities and send samples to the fish pathology unit.  This is an essential requirement to ensure the necessary monitoring and remedial action can be taken quickly to contain any potential disease outbreak. It should be understood that disease outbreaks invariably result in serious economic loss for fishfarmers and, as a consequence, it is clearly in the industry's own interest to ensure best practices apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Digital selective calling, or DSC, was introduced for merchant ships by the International Maritime Organisation, or IMO, on 1 February 1992, with the introduction of Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, or GMDSS.  The requirements for GMDSS equipment are contained within the IMO Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, Convention, as amended in 1988. DSC is the primary distress alerting facility within that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DSC provides the facility to the seafarer of transmitting and receiving distress alerts, by electronic means, on the international maritime VHF DSC distress channel 70; on the international maritime medium frequency (MF) distress frequency 2,187.5 kilohertz; and on high frequency on dedicated DSC distress frequencies within the <Col N="165" /> 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 Megahertz Maritime bands. DSC also enables the seafarer to maintain an electronic, radio watch on those international distress channels and frequencies.  The GMDSS was designed to replace an &ldquo;old&rdquo; marine radiocommunications system which relied heavily on manual operation and aural radio watchkeeping.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 February 1999, all seagoing passenger and cargo ships, and certain fishing vessels must comply with the requirements of the GMDSS.  These requirements are implemented by means of the Merchant Shipping (Radio) Rules, 1992, and the EU Council Directive 97/70/EC on fishing vessel safety.</P>
    <P>While pleasure craft are not required to comply with those rules the installation of DSC equipment on pleasure craft, suitable for its carriage, will certainly enhance safety.  I understand that some pleasure craft already carry such equipment and, in conjunction with representatives of the recreational craft sector, my Department's safety services will continue to encourage its use, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>With effect from 2002, all marine VHF radiocommunications equipment will be required to include DSC facilities.  I understand that DSC equipment, suitable for use by owners-operators of pleasaure craft is currently being designed and manufactured.  This equipment, whilst not having all of the facilities which are required for DSC equiment installed in compliance with the MS (Radio) Rules, has and will continueto have sufficient facilities to enble distresss, urgency and safety alerts to be transmitted and received.  Such equipment will be a good deal cheaper and, therefore, more accessible than the mandatorily required equipment for merchant and certain finishing vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A radio operator of any marine radiocommunications transmitter is required to hold a certificate of competency.  The certficiates are issued by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the examinations are conducted by the marine radio survey office of my Department.  A radio operator of a marine radiocommunications transmitter, which includes digital selective calling, or DSC, must hold one of the following certificates: a global maritime distress and safety system, GMDSS general operator's certificate, or GOL; a GMDSS restricted operator's certificate, or ROC; a radio operator's long range certificate, or LRC; or a radio operator's short range certificate, or SRC.  The first two certificates mentioned are required under the Merchant Shipping (Radio) Rules, 1992, and the EU <Col N="166" /> Council Directive 97/70/EC on fishing vessel safety for radio operators on vessels which are required, by international convention, to install GMDSS equipment.  The third and fourth certificates mentioned are required for radio operators on vessels which install GMDSS on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>At present, training is provided and the examinations are carried out for the GOL and the ROC at Cork and Limerick Institutes of Technology, Commencing in 1999, similar training and examinations will be carried out at the BIM national fisheries training centre, Greencastle, County Donegal, and at the new BIM training Centre in Castletownbere.  Training is provided and examinations are held for the radio operator's LRC at Greencastle, and will be available in 1999 in Castletownbere.  Training will also be provided and examinations will be held, commencing in 1999, for the radio operator's SRC, at both Greencastle and Castletownbere.  I understand there may also be opportunities for people to be trained and examined in both the LRC and SRC at the institutes of technology at Cork and Limerick. There will also be an opportunity for suitably qualified training instructors who provide the necessary radio equipment and examination facilities to train people for the SRC.</P>

      <P>After 31 January 1999, ships subject to the provision of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS 1974, as amended, will be equipped with the shipboard equipment required by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, or GMDSS.  The installation of the equipment necessary for the reception of VHF digital selective calling, or DSC, at the Irish marine emergency service or IMES centres will be completed by the end of 1999. Ireland has already installed MF DSC shore facilities.</P>
      <P>The International Maritime Organisation, also known as IMO, has urged all administrations to encourage non-SOLAS, fishing and recreational vessel to become GMDSS compliant as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Council Directive 97/70/EC requires that certain fishing vessels will have to install full GMDSS radio communications equipment appropriate to their sea area of operation.  I also intend to introduce soon radio rules to apply to fishing vessels not covered by this Council Directive.</P>
      <P>It is expected that many recreational craft will also fit VHF DSC.  Currently, equipment suitable for use on recreational craft is being designed and manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMO has stated that from the 1 February 2005 an aural distress watch on VHF channel 16 <Col N="167" /> will no longer be required on ships subject to the provisions of SOLAS.</P>
    <P>The aural distress watch on VHF channel 16 at the IMES Centres will continue for the foreseeable future.  My Department will review this requirement at regular intervals after 1 February 1999 which is the full implementation date of GMDSS.  I expect in the course of these reviews, including consultation with interested parties, a date will be identified when the aural distress watch on VHF channel 16 at IMES centres can cease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>As regards offshore petroleum exploration the most recent results are those available from the well drilled in block 18/20 off the coast of Mayo. The position in regard to the outcome of that well is as outlined in my reply to the Deputy's question on 4 November 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, since Kinsale was discovered in 1971 and brought into production in 1978, apart from Ballycotton we have had no oil or gas discovery which has been brought into commercial production.  Despite the considerable efforts to develop the Connemara field last year the licensees were unable to do so, but on the positive side I am encouraged with the flow rates from the Corrib this year.  Also this year, I have granted a lease over the Helvick field and a plan of development for the field is being prepared.</P>
      <P>There are three factors which influence companies when considering investing in an area &mdash; price, prospectivity and terms.  The price obtained for oil and increasingly gas is set internationally and is outside my control.  We promote our offshore prospectivity by encouraging data acquisition and by making data available to exploration companies.  The one factor entirely within my control is the terms under which a discovery is exploited and these, together with the tax terms, were revised six years ago following the dramatic decline in interest in our offshore.  These revisions have been successful in that they attracted the industry back to Ireland and we now have a high number of licences in place.</P>
      <P>However, with the current low oil price, it will be difficult to maintain the current high level of interest, but there is virtually no scope to further improve the terms to attract additional exploration investment and I do not propose to make any proposals in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards exploration for other minerals, I have not received any new and promising indications since answering the Deputy's question on 4 November 1998.  As I said on that occasion a decision on whether or not indications are promising is a commercial assessment to be made by the holder of the relevant Prospecting Licence.  A positive decision would lead to an application to me for a State mining facility in parallel with applications to the local authority for planning permission and to the EPA for an integrated pollution control licence after preparation of an environmental impact statement and a fully <Col N="169" /> worked out plan including sources of finance. Any such application to me is subject to public advertisement and consultation before I make a decision.</P>
    <P>As to the incentives for investment, this area is under constant review and I am satisfied that, in spite of a downturn in investment world-wide, we have increased the real value of exploration investment in Ireland and also continue to attract new companies.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 112 and 113 of 4 November 1998, in which I referred him to my report to the House dated 30 June 1998, and updated him, in general terms, on developments since then.</P>
      <P>Since my statutory report was made to the House a further 16 licences allowing exploration for gold have issued.  Six of these were over lands in County Monaghan, six over lands in County Meath, three over lands in County Dublin and one over lands in County Wexford.  In accordance with statutory requirements, advance notice of my intention to issue these licences was advertised in the local press in each case.</P>

      <P>Tonnage objectives are set for the <Col N="170" /> Irish fishing fleet by the EU MGP Decision for Ireland up to 2001.  A policy of 100 per cent replacement capacity for the introduction of vessels into the fleet is operated to ensure compliance with these objectives.  The total tonnage of the Irish fleet has remained stable over the past year.  This would include those vessels operating in the Irish Sea which are primarily in the &ldquo;polyvalent&rdquo;&mdash; whitefish &mdash; segment of the fleet.</P>
      <P>The whitefish fleet renewal programme, which supports investment in new boats, modern second hand tonnage, modernisation and safety, will, <i>inter alia</i>, assist that part of the fishing fleet which operates primarily in the Irish Sea to compete effectively in technology and efficiency terms with its UK and EU counterparts.</P>

      <P>The number of bodies recovered from the sea during the 12 month period up to 4 December 1998 in which Irish Marine Emergency Services, IMES, search and rescue resources were involved or notification was provided to IMES was 37.  This figure accounts for man overboards, missing persons, cliff fallers, boating accidents and for swimming incidents where bodies were recovered from the sea only.  It should be noted that this figure only accounts for incidents which were notified to IMES and does not include body recovery from rivers or lakes and other sea drownings which may not have been notified to IMES.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategy statement dealing with marine safety aims to ensure the highest levels of safety at sea, through an appropriate combination of statutory regulation and safety awareness promotion.  The aims are to ensure that vessels on the Irish flag or operating to or from or in Ireland are constructed, maintained and operated to accepted international safety standards; to prevent loss of life at sea through promoting awareness of marine safety; to ensure the provision of an efficient and effective marine emergency service through public and voluntary bodies, to provide effective co-ordination for those services and to co-operate effectively with other States in that operation of emergency services; to ensure that adequate navigational aids and communications networks are provided, and to support the adoption of high safety standards by the IMO, the EU and other international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming Minister with responsibility for safety at sea, I have developed a comprehensive programme of work over the next three years <Col N="171" /> which will update our maritime law and will keep Ireland to the forefront <i>vis-à-vis</i> best international practice.</P>
    <P>A priority remains to implement the recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group to minimise the risk of loss of life among the fishing community.  I am taking steps to ensure accelerated progress with regard to the introduction of improvements in the areas of fleet development, safety training, on-shore marine radio communications and safety awareness, and a programme is under way to underpin the development of a safety culture in the fishing sector through the introduction of the comprehensive safety regulations recommended by the review group.</P>
    <P>I also intend over this period to implement all relevant International Maritime Organisation Safety Conventions, including amendments to the SOLAS, Safety of Life at Sea, and STCW, Standards of Training Certification of Watchkeeping for Seafarers, Conventions and to give continued support to the IMO in the way of professional contributions to international negotiations.  In this regard, the International Safety Management, ISM, code, which puts in place a mandatory safety management system on board vessels, came into operation for certain vessels from July of this year.  All relevant Irish vessels have been certified and my Department's marine surveyors, as port state control officers, have a major role to play on the international front to ensure that foreign vessels, including ferries visiting Irish ports, comply with this code in an attempt to eliminate sub-standard shipping worldwide.</P>
    <P>The marine survey office of my Department also operates a year round programme of surveys and inspections of Irish-registered passenger and cargo vessels to ensure that these vessels are equipped, maintained and inspected to the highest international standards.  Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected regularly in exercise of Ireland's obligations as a port state.</P>
    <P>I am committed also to implementing all EU directives on safety matters as they arise, to amending merchant shipping legislation as necessary, to initiating a new marine casualty investigation system, to bringing proposals to Government for developing and resourcing the Irish Marine Emergency Service as a coastguard and to ensuring co-operation with other marine safety agencies in extending-developing their safety infrastructures.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the appropriate statutory and voluntary bodies, my Department is committed to an ongoing safety awareness programme among the marine community at all levels in order that loss of life and marine casualties can be avoided as far as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that health and safety requirements are met to the desired extent in the fishing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I first point out to the Deputy that health and safety requirements in the context of the workplace come within the remit of the Health and Safety Authority.  In regard to fishing vessels, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is to shortly introduce regulations to give effect to European Council Directive 93/103/EC on the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels. These regulations, which are being prepared in consultation with my Department, will provide for its joint implementation by the HSA and my Department, having regard to respective areas of competance.</P>
      <P>In my overall capacity as Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea, I am currently implementing a comprehensive strategy to improve fishing vessel safety, following the report of the fishing vessel safety review group.  I have, in this regard, made significant progress in the areas of fleet development, safety training, on-shore marine radio communications, safety awareness and safety legislation.  The following are the detailed particulars of the strategy.</P>
      <P>Regarding whitefish fleet renewal, the report of the review group indicated that in the absence of incentives for the renewal of the fleet there would be little improvement in the age structure and safety status of the fleet.  Accordingly, I have given top priority to the introduction of the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet. The programme involves a grant-aid support scheme and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet. The tax incentives are provided for in the Finance Act, 1998.  The programme is designed to promote investment in the whitefish fleet with the introduction of a number of new and modern second-hand vessels into the fleet.  In this connection, I recently approved over £12 million in State/EU grant-aid supporting investment of £50 million for the introduction of 31 new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  I propose to shortly announce funding towards a number of modern second-hand vessels.  In addition, a targeted modernisation scheme and support for essential safety equipment for vessels will modernise the vessels in the fleet and contribute to improved safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I draw the attention of the Deputy to the vessel safety equipment scheme under that programme, which provides for grant-aid of 50 per cent for the purchase and fitting of essential safety gear.  I have announced three rounds of approvals to date under this scheme.  I consider this vessel safety equipment scheme to be of vital importance.  The aim of this scheme is to encourage vessel owners to fit out vessels with specific on-board safety equipment.  Improved <Col N="173" /> safety equipment on board vessels can play a vital part in the ongoing battle to protect life at sea; the recent tragedies at sea bring home to us all the perilous working conditions that fishermen endure.</P>
    <P>I am generally very pleased at the high level of interest in the programme for renewal of the whitefish fleet.  It underlines the appetite and need for reinvestment in the fleet right around the coast and confirms that the incentives on offer are proving attractive to a wide range of fishermen. I, nevertheless, strongly encourage fisherment to avail of this unique funding opportunity to install vital safety equipment.  I am determined to ensure that the scheme fully delivers on the Government's objectives to revitalise the whitefish fleet and to support safety, jobs and competitiveness in the sector to the benefit of our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Regarding registration of unregistered fishing vessels, concern was expressed by the review group at the number of unregistered fishing vessels operating in Irish waters, many of which are small and in poor condition.  The group considered that these vessels constitute a serious threat to safety and recommended that this situation be addressed.  Under a special scheme approved by the European Commission, the position of previously unregistered vessels in the fishing fleet is being regularised.  Over 600 of some 900 applications under the scheme have been approved for a licence and it is hoped that all of the remaining applications will be processed by the end of this year.  The criteria under this scheme for registration require, among other matters, that vessels undergo a condition survey report in order to ensure that the vessel is safe and seaworthy.  This represents a significant improvement in our safety regulatory framework and in our safety standards for small fishing vessels in particular.</P>
    <P>Safety training, which is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews in the event of an accident at sea, continues to be provided in an accessible manner through BIM's two mobile training units in response to demand at various locations around the coast.  In addition, the construction of a new fisheries training centre in Castletownbere is nearing completion.  The centre, which will deliver safety skills instruction to fishermen in the south coast region, is targeted to be operational in early 1999.  The principal objective of BIM's coastal training programme is to generate a health and safety culture within the small scale fishing sector in particular.</P>
    <P>Funding under the EU's small scale coastal fisheries programme has been secured towards a new training initiative aimed at the spouses and families of small scale coastal fishermen.  It is hoped that the relatives of fishermen can exert a positive influence in the promotion of good safety practices on board small fishing vessels.  This pilot initiative, which is being run by BIM in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, Comharcumann Inis Meáin Teo., and Meitheal Forbartha na <Col N="174" /> Gaeltachta, will target 12 venues over the course of 18 months.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the field of on-shore marine radio communications. My Department's Irish Marine Emergency Service has arranged for the installation of new medium frequency transmitters at Rosslare and Belmullet with enhanced radio coverage and improved emergency response for fishing vessels operating in the Irish Sea and off the north westcoast. In addition, my Department has recently placed a contract for the installation of VHF digital selective calling, DSC, equipment at coast radio stations and other VHF sites around the coast and this work is due for completion at the end of next year.  Ireland will then be in a position to declare an enhanced area, known as an A1 + A2 sea area, under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, GMDSS, which will facilitate automatic distress signal reception from vessels fitted with VHF DSC working in or transiting our search and rescue area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The review group identified a need for a substantial improvement in safety awareness among Irish fishermen.  In recognition of this requirement, my Department's marine safety working group has published three practical information booklets specifically for fishing vessels.  These user-friendly publications deal with machinery failure, man overboard procedures and emergency procedures.  Furthermore, it is intended to shortly publish GMDSS guidelines for small boat users, including fishermen, in European waters. The promulgation of this series of safety information booklets can play an important part in fostering an ethos of safety consciousness in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding the ongoing improvements in the areas of fleet development, safety training, onshore marine radio communications and safety awareness, a programme is under way to underpin the development of a safety culture in the fishing sector through the introduction of the comprehensive safety regulations recommended by the review group.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the proposed safety regulations governing fishing vessels is well under way.  Regulations have already been drafted to implement European Council Directive 97/70/EC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.  These regulations, which are currently being finalised by the Attorney General's Office, cover, <i>inter alia</i>, construction, stability, machinery, fire protection, life-saving appliances and radio communications. Vessels under 24 metres in length will also be addressed by the introduction of regulations for appropriate size categories of smaller vessels operating out of our fishing ports.</P>
    <P>Draft radio rules have also been prepared, specifying the radio communications equipment, including emergency position indicating radio beacons, to be carried on all sizes of fishing vessels. I propose to introduce these rules, which are currently being finalised, at an early date.  I also <Col N="175" /> intend to bring in new regulations for the crews of fishing vessels, which will cover safety training and increased manning requirements, in line with the review group's recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department, and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, together with the Health and Safety Authority where appropriate, will continue in partnership with the fishing industry to implement the safety programme outlined above.  Our shared objective is to ensure that the priority now given to improving and maintaining safety standards will continue as a permanent and integral part of the management of our fishing fleet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the air sea rescue services available on all Irish coasts is adequate to meet current as well as projected needs at this time.  The level of air sea coverage available meets both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in June 1996 a report was completed on the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage on the east coast covering the area from Carlingford Lough to Youghal and out to the boundaries between the Irish search and rescue region and the United Kingdom regions.  All the recommendations made in the report have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.  A review of the level of marine search and rescue coverage on the south and west coasts will take place in the near future as part of the strategic management initiative.  However, all aspects of air service are kept under review and are upgraded or adapted, where necessary, as part of ongoing improvement of services or in response to the continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declared helicopter facilities available to IMES are two IMES Sikorsky all-weather medium load carrying helicopters available 24 hours, based at Shannon and Dublin Airports, together with two Air Corps helicopters.  One of the Air Corps helicopters is a light load-carrying Dauphin helicopter available 24 hours based at Finner, County Donegal, and the second is an Alouette helicopter based at Waterford Airport providing daylight cover for the east and south east coasts.  The Waterford Airport base will be upgraded to a 24-hour Dauphin helicopter service on 1 July 1999, assuming that the crew numbers remain stable.  This enhancement will complete the helicopter coverage for all Irish coasts and constitutes the implementation of one of the recommendations of the report of the review of <Col N="176" /> the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage on the east coast.</P>
    <P>I stress that while the IMES helicopters are based at Shannon and Dublin Airports and an Air Corps helicopter is based at Finner, they are available on a 24-hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. IMES helicopter call-out response time is not more than 15 minutes between 7.30 a.m. and 9 p.m. and the Air Corps call-out response time is 15 minutes by day.  All helicopters are not more than 45 minutes outside these times throughout the year.  The 24 hour helicopters are positioned so that they can reach, by day, 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour and by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical miles in two hours.</P>
    <P>I also mention that shore coverage on the Irish coasts comprises the IMES coastal units, of which there are 50 around our coast.  These units are fully equipped to respond to the risks in their area and are on call 24 hours a day.  In addition, a number of other declared sea facilities are available to the IMES.  These are facilities designated as being available according to a specific standard or set criteria.  One of these is the RNLI which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast.  Another facility is the community inshore rescue boats of which there are six at present.  The IMES can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Garda and its divers and UK coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I set out my views on the issue of Ireland's participation in the Partnership for Peace in reply to a question in this House on 5 November, and in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 28 November 1998.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the issue of Irish participation in PFP under close and active review.  My intention at this stage is quite clear.  It is to try to enhance understanding and informed discussion of the realities of PFP and also to move discussion away from the polarised views and slogans which seemed to me to characterise a good deal of such discussion as there has been about PFP, on either side of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I welcomed the initiative earlier <Col N="177" /> this year of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to devote attention to new developments in European security, including Ireland's possible participation in PFP, and I believe that the committee's deliberations have enhanced understanding of the issues within this House.</P>
    <P>I have already made my view publicly clear that PFP is not the same as membership of NATO, as the participation of 27 non-members of NATO, including the other EU neutral states and Russia, should surely demonstrate.  The case against our participation on grounds of neutrality is not persuasive. It is generally recognised that Partnership for Peace has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN-mandated peace-keeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    <P>In relation to a referendum, the Government gave a commitment at the time of the debate on ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty that, if the issue of a departure from Ireland's military neutrality were to arise in the future, the issue would be put to the Irish people for their decision in a referendum.  I reiterate that commitment.  I am committed to our policy of military neutrality and I wish to make it clear that no departure from this policy is envisaged.  I am satisfied that there is no conflict between participation in PFP and our policy of military neutrality.  Nonetheless, the opportunity of referring to the people, should the Government decide after listening to the debate that participation would be desirable, will arise in the course of the European Parliament election campaign next june, in which, no doubt, parties including my own party, as well as our partners in Government, will have the opportunity to put a policy position to the people as part of their platform.</P>
    <P>Further discussion of the issue of Ireland's participation in PFP is needed in this House and elsewhere and that discussion should address realities of the kind that I have already identified.</P>

      <P>Contrary to Dutch law protecting threatened exotic animals and plant life, this person in August 1998 attempted to export from the Netherlands a piece of coral which was confiscated by customs officials.  In November the Dutch customs wrote to her giving her the possibility of avoiding prosecution by paying a fine of 200 guilders, about IR £70, within four weeks. The Dutch authorities have indicated to the embassy in The Hague their willingness to extend by two or three weeks the period within which they will accept payment of the fine but also that they will not drop the matter.</P>

      <Col N="178" /> If the fine is not paid by then, the case will be referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office which will, if necessary, bring it to court.  I understand that, if that occurs, the fine is likely to be increased by 25 per cent.  If it transpires that a fine is imposed by a court the person concerned will be liable to be refused entry to the Netherlands as long as it remains unpaid.</P>

      <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy highlights a number of important issues which are of concern to me.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the importation of pornographic material, whether by post or other means, is prohibited under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  I understand that the customs service is responsible for the enforcement aspects of this legislation and I am aware that they are very active in this regard and that any attempts to import pornographic material are liable to seizure and prosecution.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that there are other legislative measures in place to combat the dissemination, distribution, sale and/or rental of pornographic material.  Details of these measures were given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in answer to Question No. 207 on 2 December 1998.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of this legislation is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda will act on the basis of information or complaints received in relation to matters of this kind.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Deputy to encourage any of the persons involved to report the matter to the Garda for their investigation to see if breaches of the criminal law have occurred.  There may be data protection aspects to this case as well and the Office of the Data Protection Commission may be able to investigate certain aspects of this case under the terms of the Data Protection Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the issue of pornography, in particular the issue of child pornography, was considered by the General Affairs Council, GAC, on 5 October 1998.  It concluded that the Presidency should see that the Council completes its work on the community action plan on promoting safe use of the Internet and protection against illegal and harmful contents on the Internet.  The conclusions of the GAC also sought the early completion of the draft joint action on the fight against child pornography on the Internet <Col N="179" /> and this was agreed by JHA Ministers at their Council meeting on 3-4 December 1998.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the issues raised in the correspondence referred to by him is of primary interest to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  My Department has passed on the details of this case to that Department. It would not be appropriate to bring this matter to the GAC until the issue has been fully examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and any other relevant Departments or Offices.</P>
    <P>I point out that the importation and distribution or sale of pornography are among the issues addressed in the discussion paper on the law of sexual offences which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published last May.  An analysis of the submissions received on the paper is presently being undertaken in his Department.</P>

      <P>On 12 November, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, was arrested at Rome Airport on foot of international arrest warrants issued by Turkey and Germany.  Mr. Ocalan requested political asylum in Italy.  On 2 December, the Turkish Government requested the extradition of Mr. Ocalan to Turkey in connection with the PKK campaign of terrorism.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the General Affairs Council yesterday, my Italian colleague Foreign Minister Dini briefed us on this case.  Both Mr. Oclan's application for political asylum and Turkey's request for his extradition are before the relevant authorities in Italy and decisions are awaited.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter pending the outcome of the deliberations of the competent Italian authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long standing conflict in Turkey has, as the Deputy is aware, resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 people over the last two decades and has brought hardship to the people of the region. Ireland, along with its European partners, has conveyed to the Turkish Government its view that a political solution should be found which will finally end this conflict.  It has consistently been made clear to Turkey that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due respect for human rights and the rule of law.  The EU has <Col N="180" /> also indicated that it upholds the territorial integrity of Turkey and condemns terrorism.</P>
    <P>As regards the implications of the Ocalan case for Turkey's EU membership, the Deputy will be aware that the criteria for membership were laid down at the Copenhagen Summit and are applied fully to each prospective candidate for membership. The first of these criteria is that the applicant country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. The European Commission in a recent report found that Turkey did not meet this criterion.</P>

      <P>Current efforts to resolve the Cyprus question have been concentrated on the United Nations sponsored talks process which was launched by the UN Secretary General in July 1997.  At the end of September 1998 the Secretary General had meetings in New York with President Clerides of the Republic of Cyprus and Mr. Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriot community.  The Secretary General proposed that his Deputy Special Representative, Dame Ann Hercus, should develop a process of contacts on the island with both parties with the goal of reducing tensions and promoting a just and lasting settlement. Both leaders expressed their support for the process and promised to co-operate in a constructive and flexible manner.  On 16 October last, Dame Hercus launched her confidential shuttle talks with President Clerides and Mr. Denktash.  The Secretary General will report on the process to the Security Council later this month.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a political solution for Cyprus based on a bi-communal, bi-zonal federal approach.  In this regard, we have offered every support to the renewed efforts of the Secretary General's Deputy Special Representative.  The Deputy will appreciate that mediation efforts by individual countries could detract from the efforts of the UN.  For this reason all international efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue, including by the Special Representatives for Cyprus of the EU Presidency, the United States and Russia, are fully committed to supporting the UN talks process as the most effective way of resolving the Cyprus question.</P>

      <P>As outlined in my Department's statement of strategy, it is my objective to ensure improved accessibility for mobility impaired and disabled people by arranging for the pilot-testing by CIE of low floor buses, and the negotiation of public service contracts with CIE governing the implementation of certain measures to improve the accessibility of public transport services, if the Government decides to provide additional finance for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the context of its 1999 fleet replacement programme, Dublin Bus plans to purchase 19 fully accessible midi buses, that is, 30-35 seats.  This will make a significant increase in the proportion of accessible buses operated by the company.  At present, low floor double deck buses are at the trial stage with manufacturers and Bus Átha Cliath hopes to acquire one or two on demonstration in the first half of 1999.  Bus Éireann operates a low floor bus on the Bishopstown route in Cork.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in making the railway accessible to people with disabilities. Iarnród Éireann has published an accessibility guide for passengers.  Almost all of the approximately 90 mainline stations are accessible by wheelchair users.  All of the newer rail passenger carriages, including the DART, are accessible by wheelchair users.  The new DART stations at Drumcondra and Clontarf Road and the upgraded Dún Laoghaire station are all fully accessible.</P>
      <P>All three CIE companies have established user groups involving representatives of people with disabilities to advise on the inclusion and improvement of facilities for the disabled.  The user groups meet regularly and have visited various locations to inspect facilities and potential new equipment, for example, new bus types.</P>
      <P>At present, there are no funds at my Department's disposal to assist other licensed transport operators in making their transport facilities more accessible to the disabled.</P>

      <P>No proposal to increase airport charges has been received in my Department. However, I am aware that Aer Rianta has decided not to introduce a new cycle of discount schemes related to airport charges at Dublin Airport in January next.  This represents a prudent interim position for Aer Rianta, pending further decisions on airport charges by me in due course. In any case, benefits of the 1997 and 1998 discount schemes will continue to accrue to airlines until 2003 and 2004 respectively.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has commissioned consultants to report to the board shortly with a view to formulating comprehensive proposals on airport charges to be submitted to me for my approval. In considering these proposals, I will take all relevant factors into account, including the impact any change in the level of charges would have on airlines and, consequently, on the travelling public.  I have discussed the airport charges situation with the chairman of Aer Rianta in the context of my regular meetings with him and I intend to continue to consult with both Aer Rianta and the airlines on this issue in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>With regard to annual training for the first line reserve, which consists of former members of the Permanent Defence Force including the Naval Service, the position is that members of the first line have not been required to attend for annual training or courses of instruction since 1988.  Accordingly, no former officer of the Naval Service who is now <Col N="183" /> a member of the first line reserve was called to attend for annual training in 1998.</P>
      <P>However, in 1998, it was decided to permit the employment of a maximum of ten suitably qualified officers of the first line reserve for seagoing duties pending direct recruitment of watchkeeping officers.  Accordingly, eight suitably qualified officers of the first line reserve undertook seagoing duties as watchkeeping officers during 1998 and these were paid the appropriate rates of pay and allowances.</P>
      <P>The gratuities paid in 1997 to officers of the first line reserve amounted to £68,103.  Pursuant to Defence Force regulations, the gratuities are payable regardless of whether members attend for annual training or other courses of instruction. No other payments were made to officers of the first line reserve in 1997.</P>
      <P>With regard to the training of An Slua Muirí, I am advised by the military authorities that to date in 1998, some 28 officers have undertaken annual training.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally.</P>
      <P>It is expected that £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks.  Sixty per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and equipment.  The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures have taken place.</P>
      <P>I am aware that consultants have been engaged by Castleblayney Urban District Council to carry out a strategic study of the local needs in Castleblayney and they will be meeting with all interested parties.  I await their report with interest.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the sale of the lands and barracks will proceed as soon as possible.  It is proposed that the sales will be conducted by public tender.  As Minister for Defence I am not bound to accept the highest or any tender.  The proposed sales will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial needs in the areas concerned and I intend to maximise the potential of all the properties involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The controls listed below are aimed at removing the possibility of exposure of cattle to the BSE agent through the ingestion of contaminated feed and simultaneously provide safety assurance of the consumption of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>A surveillance system is in place and all cattle slaughtered in Ireland are subjected to ante-mortem examination, at the licensed slaughter plant, by an authorised veterinarian.</P>
      <P>Herds in which a BSE case is diagnosed are slaughtered in a dedicated licensed plant, the carcases of these animals are rendered in a dedicated rendering plant and the meat and bone meal and tallow produced are incinerated.</P>
      <P>Also slaughtered at the same plant and products therefrom disposed of in the same ways are: all animals which had been previously imported from the UK; the progeny of BSE-positive animals, and birth cohorts of BSE-positive animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knackeries which handle animals dying on-farm are licensed and are operated under the supervision of DAF staff.  Specified Risk Materials, SRM's, defined as (a) the skull, the brain, the eyes, the tonsils and spinal cord of a bovine animal aged over 12 months, and (b) the skull, the brain, the eyes, the tonsils, the spinal <Col N="187" /> cord of a caprine or ovine animal which has a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum, and the spleen of a caprine or ovine animal are removed from the carcases of cattle and sheep at all slaughter plants and knackeries and are rendered at a dedicated rendering plant.  The offals remaining after the above are rendered at 133ºC, bar three for 20 minutes in accordance with EU rules.  The sale, purchase and use of the MBM produced by the process described above is controlled by licence.  Only feedmills which solely produce pig or poultry rations and farmers dedicated to pig or poultry production are granted licences to purchase and use mammalian MBM.</P>
    <P>The Swiss authorities have been involved in a validation programme for an immunoassay test developed by a Swiss company.  A similar validation programme was carried out by my authorities using a test developed by an Irish company with promising results.</P>
    <P>The ENFER immunoassay test developed by Enfer Scientific in Ireland in common with the immunoassay test developed by Prionics in Switzerland and a number of other assays which have been developed to detect abnormal PrP are currently being considered by the EU authorities for validation as an acceptable method to detect BSE.  So far, no test has been validated for detection of pre-clinical disease.  When the validation process has been completed, decisions will be made as to the use to be made of the test on tissues from animals presented for slaughter.</P>

      <P>The holding of the person named was restricted under the TB eradication scheme, following disclosure of a TB reactor in a herd test on 23 October 1998.  One of the essential prerequisities for eligibility for hardship grant is that the holding continues to be restricted following a full herd retest.  The herd of the person named is scheduled for a re-test later this month.  If the holding continues to be restricted after the herd retest and all the other eligibility criteria are met, including receipt of a completed application form, in the local district veterinary office, consideration can be given at that stage by the local district veterinary office to the herdowner's eligibility for hardship grant payment.</P>

      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage land not only those commonages which have been designated as part of a natural heritage area or special area of conservation.  The preparation of the framework plans will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  The national plan involves a destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of the quota held in 1998 for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages.  Plans prepared under the national framework plan will be reviewed when the individual commonage framework plans are available in 1999.</P>
      <P>The revised REP scheme provides that farmers with commonage land who are already in the scheme or who join the scheme in the future can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres on the basis of the national framework plan and the other conditions of the revised scheme.  It has been necessary to revise the scheme document and the agrienvironmental specifications to take account of the new measure.  These, along with application forms, will be available from my Department's farm development services offices shortly opening the way to the implementation of the revised REPS.</P>
      <P>Existing participants in REPS with commonage lands can be paid as heretofore until the implementation of the revised REP scheme.  However, where plans involving commonage have been amended, these must conform to the new arrangements before further payments can be made.  All new applicants with commonage who had not received a letter of acceptance into the scheme on or before 28 July are required to conform to the new arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that since CAP reform arrangements were introduced in 1992, restrictions are in place in a number of EU funded schemes which limit the size of the claim or restrict eligibility to certain categories of farmer. These limits and restrictions arise from policy decisions within the framework of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>Article 2.2 of Commission Regulation 3887/92 provides that:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take the measures necessary to avoid that the conversion of existing holdings or the creation of new holdings after 30 June 1992 to the patently improper avoidance of the provisions relating to individual limits on eligibility for premium or land setaside requirements, imposed under the schemes indicated in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No. 3887/92.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively this requires that the Department must satisfy itself that where new holdings are created after 30 June 1992 they are legitimate entities managed separately from existing holdings and that holdings which existed prior to 30 June 1992 are not split into two or more holdings for the sole purpose of avoiding individual limits on eligibility for premiums.  Applying this requirement to the Teagasc farms I am satisfied that there was no conversion of existing holdings or the creation of new holdings after 30 June 1992 which led to the improper avoidance of the provisions <Col N="202" /> relating to individual limits on eligibility for premium.</P>

      <P>The applicant's REPS application includes commonage land, and under the terms of the revised REP scheme a framework plan must be drawn up for each commonage.  The framework plans will be prepared under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will be some time before framework plans are available for all commonages.</P>
      <P>Interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  The national plan involves a destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of the quota held in 1998 for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, including Donegal.</P>
      <P>The revised REP scheme provides that farmers with commonage land who are already in the scheme or who join the scheme in the future can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres on the basis of the national framework plan and the other conditions of the revised scheme.  It has been necessary to revise the scheme document and the agrienvironmental specifications to take account of the new measures.  These, with application forms, will be available from my Department's farm development service offices shortly opening the way for the implementation of the revised REPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disallowance, £18 million approximately, in respect of multiple tendering arose from a difference between my Department and the European Commission on the interpretation of EU legislation.  My Department's interpretation was shared by a number of member states which were also subjected to disallowance.  These member states, with Ireland, appealed the Commission's decision to the European Court of Justice which upheld the Commission's interpretation.</P>
      <P>The disallowances of £50 million in respect of beef intervention storage were applied on the basis of the Commission's assessment of weaknesses in the system in 1990 and 1991.  Ireland has acknowledged that the beef intervention control system was severely over-stretched in 1990 and 1991, when some 470,000 tonnes of beef at a value of £750 million were taken into intervention over a short period in an emergency operation.  This was done to prevent a total collapse of the Irish beef market at a time of major international market disruption.  This was fully acknowledged in the report of the beef tribunal.  Ireland unsuccessfully contested, up to European Court level, some of the bases of the Commission's findings and the extent of the disallowances applied.</P>
      <P>The immediate improvements in the intervention control systems begun in 1991 were recognised by the conciliation body and the Commission, and no disallowances under Article 8 of Regulation 729/70 have been imposed in respect of beef intervention controls since 1991.  The control system has been continually and significantly upgraded since then and intake levels have been considerably lower.  This work has been endorsed in the many visits of Commission officials and the Court of Auditors, and in the reports of the certification body appointed under the EU process of accreditation of paying agencies.</P>
      <P>Disciplinary action against an individual official in the Department did not arise on the grounds that the weaknesses revealed were primarily of a system nature and the intake situation faced in 1990 and, to a lesser extent, in 1991 was unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances relating to the second case referred to by the Deputy have been outlined in recent replies to questions.  They relate to the decision by my Department to allocate import licences to a number of meat processors rather than to the company he refers to.  This decision was taken in good faith and was supported by legal advice from the office of the Attorney General. It is important in this connection to make it <Col N="207" /> clear that there was no &ldquo;collusion or conspiracy&rdquo; on the part of any officer of my Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that while my Department's interpretation of the relevant EU law was subsequently found to be incorrect, and while there were shortcomings in the administrative procedures and customer relations practices employed, disciplinary action is not warranted.</P>

      <P>Because of the radical changes to the income tax structure in the 1999 budget, and the substantial reduction in the number of those in the tax net, it is more relevant to look at the percentage of total tax units on file categorised by those who are exempt, those on marginal relief, those liable at the standard rate and those on the higher rate of income tax.  This information is given below for the last five years.</P>

    <P>Figures from 1996-97 onwards are provisional and subject to revision.</P>
    <P>The number of taxpayers liable for tax at the top rate in the 1999-2000 tax year will fall by 17,000 compared to what would have been the case in the absence of budget changes.  However, because of the reduction in the overall number of taxpayers as a result of budget measures, the previous measure which showed the numbers on the higher rate as a percentage of those paying tax, that is, excluding exempt cases, will increase from 42.4 per cent pre-budget to 43.9 per cent post-budget.</P>
    <P>In the 1999-2000 tax year, the standard rated personal allowances and PAYE allowance will be deducted after tax is calculated rather than before the tax calculation as was the case up to now.  This should be taken into account in comparing 1999-2000 with earlier years.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the central transfer scheme, clerical officers seeking a transfer within the Civil Service, from Dublin to an office outside Dublin, apply in writing to the personnel section of their parent Department, indicating the geographical location to which they wish to transfer.  The personnel section then forwards the application to all Government Departments and offices which have offices in that location.  The maintenance of individual transfer lists is a matter for DepartmentsOffices which have offices outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>Under the decentralisation programme, from time to time, opportunities for transfer to the decentralised offices are advertised throughout the Civil Service by means of circular.  An officer who meets the eligibiliity requirements specified in the particular circular may apply for such a transfer.  The selection process is a matter for the Department-Office where the vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has no offices outside Dublin, therefore, no transfer lists are held in, or administered by my Department.  Furthermore, details are not held centrally of applications made.</P>
      <P>The office of the Revenue Commissioners has offices in Kilkenny and there are at present in excess of 100 clerical officers on their central transfer list awaiting transfer to those offices. These applications are prioritised on the basis of the date the application is made.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works maintains a list of clerical officers who wish to transfer to its decentralised offices in Kilkenny.  This list is prioritised on the basis of the date each application is made.  Five clerical officers have transferred from other Departments to these decentralised offices in 1998.  There are still a substantial number of applicants remaining on the transfer list for the Kilkenny office of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the central transfer arrangements set out in agreements with the staff side for the Civil Service, be adhered to where possible, subject, as the staff will be aware to the needs of the work of the various Departments and offices. I am happy that the present decentralisation procedures operate satisfactorily and no changes are planned.</P>

      <P>Assuming the enactment of the changes announced in the 1999 budget I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that if the general and aged income tax exemption limits for single and widowed persons were increased to the level of earnings of £200 per week, and assuming a <i>pro rata</i> increase of double those amounts for married couples, the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £1,165 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>However, raising the exemption limits in this way would significantly increase the numbers in the marginal relief tax system who would then face a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent.  Successive Governments have supported the policy of moving persons out of the marginal relief tax system through ensuring that increases in allowances are greater than increases in exemption limits, as endorsed by the Tax and Welfare Integration Group, because this course of action alleviates poverty traps over time.  Budget 1999, presented last week, made significant progress in this regard, reducing by two thirds the numbers on marginal relief.  If instead, the personal allowances for single and widowed persons were increased to the level of such earnings, with <i>pro rata</i> increase of double that amount for married couples, the cost would be of the order of £1,887 million.</P>

      <P>The following schedule sets out the increase in weekly income for a widowed parent with three school going children, taking account of the income tax changes and social welfare increases announced in budget 1999.  The numbers have been prepared on the assumption that the widowed parent is under 66 years of age and has ceased to be eligible for the widows bereavement allowance, i.e the spouse of the widow-widower died more than five years previously.</P>
      <P>The gains in weekly net income at each of the income levels referred to in the question are around £13; approximately £10 of this increase is as a result of income tax changes and the remainder arises from the increase to the contributory pension.  The increases in child benefit announced in the budget will add a further £2.30 to net weekly income.  I noted in my budget speech last week that the move to tax credits is particularly complex for widows and widowed parents.  The existing allowances for widows (£500), widowed parents (£2,650) and lone parents (£3,150) will continue to be granted at the marginal rate.  This will ensure that widows and widowed and single parents paying tax at the higher rate do not lose from the move to standard rating.  I have also provided for an increase of £1,050 at the standard rate in the allowances for widowed parents and single parents, which will provide additional benefits from the budget 1999 for these groups, in addition to those they will receive as ordinary taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has the expert advice of its scientific committee which is chaired by Professor Michael Gibney of Trinity College, Dublin. Recognising the threat to food safety posed by the emergence of E. coli 0157 the scientific committee, through its microbiology subcommittee, established a multi-disciplinary working group on E. coli 0157 in July 1998.  The working group has met on a number of occasions and is presently drafting its report.  It is expected that the final report will be available in February 1999.</P>
      <P>The working group is chaired by Dr. Cliona Foley-Nolan, specialist in public health medicine in the Southern Health Board.  The other members of the working group are:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services in this sector over a five year period.  In relation to the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality, I presume the Deputy is referring to that report's recommendations in regard to people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its first six months in office, the Government made available £10 million to address immediate and pressing problems relating to the provision of aids and appliances for people with physical and <Col N="216" /> sensory disabilities and to address deficits of voluntary agencies providing services in the sector. This year a further £8.4 million was provided comprising £2.4 million additional revenue for the maintenance of existing services, £3 million additional revenue for development of services and £3 million capital to support developments in the sector.  Last week, I announced the provision of a further £4 million by way of Supplementary Estimate for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>In all, therefore, up to the end of 1998, an additional £22.4 million will have been invested in the physical and sensory disability sector by this Government, underscoring its commitment to implementing Towards an Independent Future. This compares most favourably against the provision of £3.688 million by the previous administration in the first half of 1997 immediately following the publication of the report.  In 1999 a total of £9.4 million additional revenue (£12.4 million in a full year in the year 2000) is being provided, £6.4 million in my Department's Estimates and £3 million in the budget.  This funding will be used for the maintenance of existing services including training for people with physical and sensory disabilities and for the development of the services.  The sector will also benefit from the provision of capital funding of £4 million in 1999.</P>

    <P>* In the Eastern Health Board area, there is no waiting list for orthodontic treatment for children in Categories I and II.  All Category I patients, the category of greatest need, are assessed and treated immediately.  A treatment programme for Category II patients is put in place immediately following assessment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> All health boards with the exception of the Midland Health Board now have consultant orthodontists employed in their orthodontic departments. The North-Eastern Health Board appointed a consultant orthodontist with effect from September 1988.  The Midland Health Board intends to appoint a full-time consultant orthodontist with effect from 1 April 1999.  All health boards will then have in place a consultant led orthodontic service as provided under the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the guidelines. I understand that this group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.  It is not possible to guarantee treatment within a certain time frame for all patients on treatment waiting lists.  The objective of the current review of the orthodontic services is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the Dental Health Action Plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, he has had with the authorities of the Mater Hospital, Dublin 7, in relation to the long waiting lists for various procedures; the action, if any, he has taken to help alleviate the difficulties since the publication of the June 1998 statistics on the extent of the waiting list problem in the hospital; if he will ensure that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 will receive appropriate medical treatment from the hospital as soon as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely conscious of the need to reduce overall waiting lists and average waiting times for procedures.  To this end, I have allocated a total of £20 million in 1999 to reduce waiting lists and waiting times significantly.  The figure allocated in 1998 for this purpose was £12 million, to which I added a further £8 million for waiting list work in 1999.  This total figure of £20 million for 1999 represents a 66 per cent increase over the funding available in 1998, and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated in 1997 by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have allocated a total of £11 million to service areas which are of particular importance to implementing the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative.  The report recommended a range of <Col N="221" /> steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work.  It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care.  This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and communitybased services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>The £11 million that I have allocated with these issues in mind comprises £9 million for services for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services.  It will be allocated so such areas as community nursing units, community supports, home help services and the subvention of nursing homes, all of which have a part to play in reducing pressures on acute hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Mater Hospital, the Deputy will wish to know that included in the hospital's letter of determination for 1998 was a sum of £664,000 specifically for the reduction of waiting lists.  I can confirm that the waiting list returns which the hospital has furnished to my Department for the end of September 1998, the most recent information available to me, indicate that the Mater Hospital has achieved a reduction of 3 per cent in numbers waiting over the same period last year, in those specialities targeted under the 1998 waiting list initiative.  In addition, it has stemmed the growth in the hospital's overall waiting lists.  In recent weeks, I have been in discussion with the hospital's management in relation to the hospital's performance under the 1998 initiative and explored with them potential strategies for tackling waiting lists in the coming year.  I am pleased to say that the hospital's 1999 allocation under the Waiting List Initiative is £1,250,000, which represents a 100 per cent increase over its 1998 allocation.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the query regarding the individual patient case, the Deputy will appreciate that the determination of out-patient appointments is a matter for the hospital authorities in the first instance, based on a clinical assessment of need.  Therefore, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Mater Hospital to investigate the position regarding this patient.  Given the particular circumstances of this case, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly, as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1965 an arrangement has been in place whereby the Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases. This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill <Col N="222" /> persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. The service is also provided for the removal from the islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient.  Since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, which operates from Shannon Airport, is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the role which a dedicated air ambulance service could play in enhancing the effectiveness of the ambulance service.  However, proposals for the development of an air ambulance service must be placed in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally and any initiative in this area must complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service and first responder programmes. The particular role of air ambulance was examined by the standing committee on air ambulance services.  The standing committee undertook a detailed examination of a number of independent proposals for the establishment of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service which were received from groups interested in this area.  Meetings took place with a number of these groups.</P>
      <P>Following these meetings, officials of my Department have worked with other interested parties to clarify a number of issues regarding needs, costs and benefits deriving from having a dedicated and purpose-equipped air ambulance service.  I remain committed to further improving pre-hospital care services and I have allocated an additional £2.7 million for developments in the field of pre-hospital care in 1999.  This funding represents the largest ever increase in resources for this area and will assist considerably in improving emergency medical services.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the National Cancer Forum are as follows: To advise the Minister on:</P>
      <P>&mdash; progress in the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the co-ordination of cancer services at supra-regional and national level;</P>
      <P>&mdash; best practice in cancer prevention, treatment and care;</P>

    <P>&mdash; the evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of cancer services;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the co-ordination of research into cancer, in conjunction with the Health Research Board.</P>
    <P>To carry out its above role, the forum may</P>
    <P>&mdash; liaise with the Regional Directors for Cancer Services and</P>
    <P>&mdash; liaise with the Steering Committee on the National Breast Cancer Screening Programme and the Advisory Group on the Cervical Screening Programme.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Report annually to the Minister for Health on the state of cancer services in the country as a whole and on the implementation of the National Cancer Strategy.</P>
    <P>I referred one regional cancer plan, that relating to the Midland Health Board area, to the National Cancer Forum for its expert advice in relation to the organisation of cancer treatment services.  In general, the processing of regional cancer plans is a matter for the relevant health board and it is not necessary for the forum to advise me individually on each one of them.  The forum is fully aware of the proposals relating to the cancer plans prepared by each region, and is of course free to offer me any advice on matters relating to these plans as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>Since the proposals prepared in respect of the Midland Health Board region were the subject of particular disagreement at local level, and since there were questions about whether some of the alternative proposals were in line with the criteria set down for cancer services under the National Cancer Strategy, I considered it appropriate to refer them for expert advice to the National Cancer Forum.  In the case of other regions, no such issues arose and it was not necessary for me to refer them formally to the forum for their specific advice.  No service plans have been referred to the National Cancer Forum to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of ophthalmic services in County Donegal is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board.  I have been informed by the board that on 1 January 1998 there were 1,995 adults and 1,100 children on the waiting list for ophthalmic services in County Donegal.  The board undertook a combination of measures to tackle these waiting lists such as the <Col N="224" /> provision of additional community ophthalmic physician sessions and the use of the services of private optometrists for adult sight-testing.  These measures were assisted by the grant of £89,000 which I made to the board at the end of last year specifically for use in reducing waiting lists for ophthalmic services.  As a result of these measures, by 15 November last, the number of adults on the waiting list had been reduced from 1,995 to 942 and the number of children had been reduced from 1,100 to 978.  These reductions were achieved despite the increased demand for ophthalmic services.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the difficulties which the North-Western Health Board experienced over the last year in its ophthalmic service was the fact that a vacancy for a whole time community ophthalmic optician in Donegal existed in the early part of 1998 and that it took some time to recruit a temporary replacement.  The board is now awaiting a recommendation for a permanent appointment from the Local Appointments Commission. After the permanent appointment has been made, the board intends to retain the services of the temporary community ophthalmic optician for a time in order to reduce further the childrens' waiting list.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, a working group of representatives of the health boards and the Association of Optometrists Ireland was established to discuss the provision of an adult sight-testing scheme which would replace the existing <i>ad hoc</i> schemes and which would be similar in its application in each health board.  I understand that discussions are at an advanced stage for a scheme for provision of primary eye examinations and spectacles to eligible adults by private optometrists.  I have made available the sum of £123,000 to the North-Western Health Board, in addition to its ongoing funding for ophthalmic services, for the implementation of this scheme in its functional area in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255, 256, 257, 259 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a total of £20 million in 1999 to reduce waiting lists and waiting times significantly. The figure allocated in 1998 for this purpose was £12 million, to which I added a further £8 million for waiting list work in 1999.  This total figure of £20 million for 1999 represents a 66 per cent increase over the funding available in 1998, and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated in 1997 by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have allocated a total of £11 million to service areas which are of particular importance to implementing the recommendations of the Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative.  The report recommended a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work.  It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care.  This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community <Col N="228" /> based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>The £11 million that I have allocated with these issues in mind comprises £9 million for services for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services.  It will be allocated to such areas as community nursing units, community supports, home help services and the subvention of nursing homes, all of which have a part to play in reducing pressures on acute hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department has already had discussions with health boards and voluntary hospitals on the implementation of the immediate term recommendations of the Review Group on the Waiting list Initiative.  Based on these discussions and on the recommendations of the report, my Department will shortly be issuing a policy circular on a range of operational issues relating to the operation of the waiting list initiative for 1999 and subsequent years.  In this connection, hospitals have already commenced a validation process which involves bulk postal reviews where appropriate. The policy circular will set out further guidelines aimed at achieving an improved flow of information between primary and hospital care regarding the status of each patient on a public in-patient waiting list.  The importance of developing a written policy on planning the discharge of older patients will be emphasised in the policy circular.</P>
    <P>At the request of my Department, agencies reviewed their capacity for carrying out waiting list work in 1999, and submitted their conclusions to the Department.  A number of hospitals identified scope for carrying out additional activity in order to reduce waiting lists, and some have indicated that they will be in a position to carry out waiting list work on behalf of other agencies.  On this basis, I was able to allocate waiting list funding having regard to the relative capacity of each agency.</P>
    <P>The increased allocations to agencies will enable any necessary improvements in information systems, and the appointment of bed managers and bed utilisation committees as appropriate, to be carried out.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to encourage acute hospitals to run at maximum efficiency and to avail of the possibility of day care treatment as an alternative to in-patient care, where clinically appropriate.  This policy has been supported in recent years both through capital programmes in the acute sector and through service developments funded by my Department.  I will continue to look for opportunities <Col N="229" /> in this area in discussions with health agencies on their 1999 service plans.</P>

      <P>The service plans which, under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, health boards are required to adopt and submit annually to me as Minister for Health and Children, are used both for the planning and monitoring of service delivery. There has been a particular emphasis on the need to involve professionals, including especially hospital consultants, in the development of service plans, and while this is only the second year that service plans have been a legislative requirement, emphasis has been placed on the need to address the issues related to the mix of public and private patients treated in hospitals.</P>
      <P>The main method of monitoring acute hospital activity is through the integrated management reports sent each month to my Department by health boards and public voluntary hospitals.  In addition, implementation of the 1991 Health (Amendment) Act and associated regulations relating to the designation and use of public and private beds in such a way as ensure equity of access, is monitored on a quarterly basis.  I have decided that from 1 January 1999 this monitoring will be carried out monthly and the relevant returns sent to my Department with the integrated management report.  My Department has already notified the relevant health agencies of this increased monitoring.</P>

      <P>The cheapest 300 mg strength allopurinol tablets available on the Irish market are Allopurinol tablets from Cox which have an ingredient cost of IR£8.46 for 100 tablets.  On a <i>pro rata</i> basis this is an ingredient cost of IR£2.37 for 28 tablets.  There are two different brands of Allopurinal 300 mg tablets in a 28 pack size on the Irish market. Caplenal tablets have an ingredient cost of £5.89 and Zyloric tablets have an ingredient cost of £8.95. While a tariff price, flat rate, system for non-branded generic drugs operates in the UK, I understand that the UK ingredient cost of Caplenal tablets 300 mg in a 28 pack size is £3.55 sterling and the ingredient cost of Zyloric 300 mg in a 28 pack size is £7.86 sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> Where these products are dispensed to patients under the general medical services scheme, the pharmacist is paid the ingredient cost of the medicine plus a dispensing free, currently £1.77. Where these items are dispensed privately, the price of the product is the ingredient cost, plus a dispensing fee, plus a retail mark-up of 50 per cent.  The Department has no function in determining the retail mark-up or the dispensing fee in respect of the private dispensing of medicines, as these were established on the basis of tradition and practice.</P>
    <P>The price of drugs and medicines ex manufacturer in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &mdash; IPHA, formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &mdash; FIC. Due to the nature of the pricing agreements with the pharmaceutical industry some discrepancies exist between the prices of individual products in Ireland and the UK.  Price differentials in respect of generic prescription medicines are due in large measure to a vibrant generic market in the UK and in Northern Ireland where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition that affects prices charged for generic medicines.</P>
    <P>However, overall the current agreement has resulted in a stabilisation of prices in Ireland as compared with the rest of Europe given that a price freeze on the price of medicines to the Irish market exists for the duration of the current agreement.  Generally Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are in line with prices in the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The provision of drug treatment and rehabilitation services is a matter for health boards in the first instance.  There are strict protocols in operation in relation to the provision of funding for voluntary agencies which are funded by health boards.  Under these protocols details of the bona fides of such agencies must be submitted to the respective boards together with annual audited accounts and other relevant documentation.  If <Col N="231" /> such information is not available or not satisfactory funding is withheld.</P>
      <P>In the case of the group to which the Deputy refers there is no direct funding from health boards.  In addition, it operates outside of Ireland, which makes it difficult to obtain an exact picture of its operations, as a lot of earlier details on the group were based on newspaper articles and anecdotal information.  My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and some health boards and parents who have an interest in this group, are carrying out an investigation into its activities, in order to assess the appropriateness of the services of the group.</P>
      <P>My Department does not maintain a register of such groups.  The health promotion unit, has, however, printed a Directory of Alcohol, Drugs and Related Services in the Republic of Ireland. This publication, which I am forwarding to the Deputy, has been compiled by an expert in the area of addiction, Ms.  Sally Edwards, M.P.R.I.I., with the assistance of health board personnel and other experts in the field.  It contains a listing of alcohol and drugs services, both voluntary and statutory, which are available in health boards and it has been developed as a reference for people looking for such services.  Le Patriarch is not mentioned in this publication.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272, 273 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982 confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act, 26 July 1982 or the lifetime of his or her spouse.  Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession under the 1982 Act expires on 25 July 2002, subject to the tenancy lasting a minimum period of five years.</P>
      <P>Information is not available on the number of tenants whose right to retain possession of a dwelling is liable to be affected by the expiry of the 1982 Act.  The most recent information from local authorities indicates that at the end of December 1997 some 9,400 formerly controlled dwellings were registered by the landlord with the local authority.  This figure would include dwellings still occupied by persons whose position remains unchanged after 25 July 2002, other dwellings to which the Act may no longer apply and those that may be affected by the expiry of the Act.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the implications of the expiry of the protection afforded to successor tenants under the 1982 Act and any necessary decisions will be made well in advance of the expiry of the existing provisions.</P>

The Environmental Protection Agency has a supervisory role in this regard, and is required under section 58 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to prepare reports annually on the monitoring by the authorities and <Col N="235" /> to carry out such monitoring as it considers necessary to verify information transmitted to it.  Copies of the reports prepared by the agency for this purpose are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Asbestos cement piping, to specification ISEN 512 in relation to public cement pressure pipes, is used by local authorities for water mains.  Such piping requires, <i>inter alia</i>, bitumen lining and coating.  This type of piping is widely used internationally for water mains and is a well established and accepted piping material for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation, in its most recent analysis in relation to asbestos in drinking water, stated that there is no consistent evidence that ingested asbestos is hazardous to health and concluded that there was no need to establish a health based guideline value for asbestos in drinking water.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of the presence of asbestos in supplies of drinking water in Ireland and asbestos is not the subject of systematic monitoring in such supplies.</P>

While no statistics are available in my Department as to the length of this piping used nationally, the report of the Greater Dublin Water Supply Strategic Study shows that asbestos cement piping accounts for over 11 per cent or 656,000 metres, of water mains in the greater Dublin region.  This type of piping is widely used internationally for water mains and is well established and accepted piping material for this purpose.</P>

A tender report and tender recommendation is awaited from Westmeath County Council.

In these circumstances it is not possible to indicate the number of additional households that may eventually be served.</P>

The infrastructural requirements necessary to supply the areas mentioned include a water treatment works, pipelines, pumping stations and reservoirs.  The estimated cost of the South Westmeath water supply scheme is upwards of £23 million of which £4 million approximately would be required to provide a distribution system to Tang/Tubberclair/Glasson.

      <P>A detailed examination of the issues that arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats concluded that no practical arrangement could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers or local authorities or even to other tenants in a flat complex who would not wish to purchase.  The three main reasons why local authority flats would be a bad buy for tenants relate to the level of service charges that would be necessary; public liability insurance; and the future saleability of purchased flats.</P>
      <P>These matters were outlined in detail in the 1996 policy document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead,</i> copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were, therefore, advised that flats should not be offered for sale under the current tenant purchase scheme, but that authorities should give consideration to the sale of maisonettes, particularly those which do not have common areas, where satisfactory arrangements, not involving the difficulties that arise in the case of flats, could be devised.</P>
      <P>The difficulties and disadvantages for tenants of purchasing local authority flats which have been clearly identified still apply and, consequently, there are no proposals to amend the scheme in this respect.</P>

Each centre provides a wide range of information on services and entitlements and are located in areas to ensure that they are fully accessible by people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>An Establishment Group for a National Disability Authority and Disability Support Service was set up by the Government in November 1997 to prepare detailed proposals for the establishment of a national disability authority and the future location of departmental responsibility for the National Rehabilitation Board, its staff and its assets.  In its report published in July last, the group recommended that the requirements for a disability support service should be met through a merger of the National Social Service Board (NSSB) and appropriate information services of the National Rehabilitation Board into a new organisation.</P>
      <P>This new organisation will provide an integrated information support service which will assist, advise and support all citizens.  The establishment group was satisfied that this approach would meet the requirements of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities, in a costeffective manner which would ensure non-duplication of services.</P>
      <P>The Government has accepted the establishment group's recommendation and the new service will operate under the aegis of my Department. It is my intention to bring legislation before the House early in the new year for the establishment of this new service.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is administered by the eight health boards and the Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Legislation makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.  These payments are known as exceptional needs payments (ENPs).</P>
      <P>Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>An ENP towards funeral expenses may be made where it is established that there is an inability to pay the costs in part or in full by the family concerned.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made an application on 10 November 1998 for an ENP towards the cost of the funeral expenses of his late spouse who died on 23 October 1998.  The funeral bill, which was paid on 7 November 1998, was covered by an insurance policy.  The application for an ENP for assistance towards the cost of the funeral expenses was disallowed on the basis that no exceptional need existed.</P>
      <P>An application for an ENP for clothing was made approximately two weeks after the funeral and was refused on the grounds that there was no evidence that the individual had an exceptional need.  An appeal has been lodged against both decisions.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week (£8 per week in smokeless zones) is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 3,300 additional contributory old age pensioners would qualify for a fuel allowance if the maximum amount of additional income which they are allowed to have and still qualify for fuel allowance was raised from £30 per week to £50 per week.  This would cost approximately £0.6 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.  Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week effective from June 1999 were announced in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>I have also announced that the current income limit will be increased from £15 to £30 per week in addition to the maximum rate of the relevant contributory social welfare payment, with effect from the commencement of the next heating season in October 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>At any one time there are some 6,000 appeals before the Social Welfare appeals office.  The average time to process all appeals at present is 21 weeks.</P>
      <P>The appeals process involves the putting together of the necessary evidence to enable the appeal to be determined, the scheduling of hearings where necessary and the making and notification of decisions.  In putting together the evidence it is frequently necessary to arrange for further investigations to be carried out or for the appeals office to obtain further information from the Department and/or the appellant.  In some cases adjournments are sought by the appellant or his/her legal representative.  All of the procedures involve delay but are designed to ensure that full information is available to the appeals officer in making his decision.  Where the appeals officer decides that the issue cannot be resolved without an oral hearing, as happens in 56 per cent of all cases, a further delay inevitably occurs.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasijudicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.  The inevitable time-lag inherent in such a process is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>Processing times for appeals here compare favourably with the experience of other countries in this regard.  However it is a major objective of the Social Welfare appeals office to achieve further improvement in this regard.  However, at all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with or at a cost to the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>
      <P>Appeals officers are required to have a high level of knowledge and expertise in relation to the social welfare system.  Four additional appeals officers were appointed during the second half of 1997.  In recent years officers in some regional locations were appointed as appeals officers, including two of the additional appointments mentioned.  There are no plans, however, to restructure the appeals office on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Social Welfare appeals office are considering the scope for further reducing the time taken to process appeals and the future staffing needs of the office will be considered in this regard.</P>

      <P>As you are aware my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies <Col N="247" /> in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met. Grant applications should be approved by the Department prior to the purchase and/or installation of the equipment.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.  Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation for 1998 to £5 million.</P>
    <P>The closing date for applications under the 1998 scheme was 22 May and applications received before that date are currently being considered in the regional offices of my Department, which process applications under the scheme. Unfortunately, it is not possible to consider any further applications at this stage.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July of last year this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Provision of £2 million has been made in the 1999 Estimates for continuation of the work supported under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 21 of 7 May 1998.  I acknowledge the commitment and work of the members of the Irish Seal Sanctuary in relation to the welfare, rescue and care of seals. However, my responsibilities for wildlife do not extend to animal welfare, which is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a resolution adopted by Cashel Urban District Council in September which sought to have the possibility of re-roofing the cathedral at the Rock of Cashel examined.  The proposal gives rise to serious difficulties in the archaeological and architectural fields, and it also involves significant issues of necessity, authenticity and cost.  I am at present giving careful consideration to the motion in that context and I expect to be in a position to convey my views in relation to it to the council and to the Deputy very soon.</P>

      <P>Since this Government took office, a proactive approach has been adopted in promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities.  I am determined to continue the momentum that has been generated and to make further progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware it was accepted by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report &mdash; A Strategy for Equality &mdash; that because of their nature a number of the 402 recommendations contained in the report would have to be implemented over time. To date, considerable progress has been made in <Col N="251" /> the implementation of the report in a number of critical areas.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, in November 1997 and in July 1998 we made significant announcements regarding the key infrastructural recommendations of the report relating to the establishment of a national disability authority and a disability support service.</P>
    <P>One of the key infrastructural recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities related to the establishment of a national disability authority and a disability support service.  On 18 November, 1997 the Government gave approval in principle to the establishment, on a statutory basis, of a national disability authority and a disability support service and it approved the formation of an establishment group tasked, <i>inter alia</i>, with the preparation of detailed proposals for the establishment of the NDA.  Subsequently, on 27 July 1998, the Government adopted the report of the establishment group &mdash; Building a Future Together &mdash; and approved the drafting, as a matter of priority, of a national disability authority establishment Bill.  The Bill, entitled &ldquo;National Disability Authority Bill, 1998&rdquo;, was published on 3 December and is being initiated in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On the issues of mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities and the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service, it is envisaged that this will involve: (a) the transfer of vocational training and employment services from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; (b) meeting the information, advice and advocacy requirements of people with disabilities, their families and carers by the establishment of a new organisation under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which will merge the appropriate services of the National Rehabilitation Board and the National Social Services Board to form one mainstream organisation and (c) the provision within the health services of the audiology services currently provided by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made towards achieving our commitments in relation to the issue of mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities as well as the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent representative council of people with disabilities in 1999 is being supported by my Department and significant funding has already been made available in this regard.</P>
    <P>Six pilot community projects relating to people with disabilities are being funded by my Department, in line with the commission's recommendations. Four of these related to access to information and participation in the local decision making process and two relate to the facilitation of cross-sectoral planning for delivery of services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> A plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is to be presented to me by the end of February next and it is my intention to submit it to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>We are also establishing a monitoring committee under the aegis of my Department to progress the attainment of the 3 per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.</P>

The task force is also considering, in conjunction with the commission's report, the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities &mdash; Towards an Independent Future.

      <P>On 29 July 1998, I appointed the members and chairperson of the National Disability Authority.  An inaugural meeting was held on 9 September 1998 at which both myself and Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, attended.  I understand that the authority met again on 20 October 1998 and that its third meeting is taking place today 8 December 1998.  The 20 members of the authority are as follows: Ms Angela Kerins (Chairperson), Ms Margot Davis, Mr. John O'Gorman, Mr. Brendan Ingoldsby, Ms Sylda Longford, Mr. Diarmuid Ring, Mr. Jim Casey, Ms Helen Caesar, Mr. Gene Lambert, Ms Maisie Dooley, Ms Noreen Gildea, Mr. John Dolan, Mr. Robert Grier, Ms Paula Carey, Mr John Finnerty, Ms Liz O'Leary, Ms Olive Moriarty, Mr. Matt Connor, Mr. Muris O'Donogue and Mr. Christy Lynch.</P>
      <P>The establishment group for the National Disability Authority and a disability support service reported to Government in July 1998 with detailed proposals in relation to the role and functions of the NDA.  The Government approved the establishment group's report, Building a Future Together, on 27 July and the text of the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, has recently been published.  The principal functions of the NDA will be to advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to disability policy and to research and develop standards for services and programmes provided to people with disabilities.  It will also play a key role in monitoring and evaluating the implementation of standards in services and programmes provided to people with disabilities and in promoting best practice.</P>
      <P>The NDA will operate under the aegis of this Department and will be funded annually by grant from the budgetary allocation to the Department. An allocation of £2.021 million has been provided for the NDA in respect of 1999.</P>

      <P>The establishment group for the National Disability Authority and a disability support service which reported to Government in July of this year made a number of recommendations for the mainstreaming of services provided to people with disabilities.  One of these recommendations was that responsibility for vocational training and employment services would transfer from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with effect from 1999.  This recommendation was approved by Government and the establishment group is currently working to put the necessary arrangements in place to enable the transfer to be effected at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>As a result of the proposed relocation of departmental responsibility, I understand that vocational training and employment services currently provided by the National Rehabilitation Board will transfer to FÁS in early 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding for six pilot community projects.  These comprise four community services projects operating in Cork, Tallaght-Clondalkin, Caherciveen and Ennis and two community action plans to be piloted in Meath and in South Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> The pilot community services projects in Cork, Tallaght-Clondalkin and Cahirciveen are funded by the Department through Area Development Management Ltd.  who oversee their function and the project in Ennis is funded directly by the Department.  The latter project is being operated under the aegis of the Disabled People of Clare. Funding of £120,000 was made available by the Department in 1997 for the four pilot community services projects and £160,000 is being made available this year to fund the projects.  These amounts include a sum of £30,000 which was paid to Area Development Management Ltd.  in each of the years 1997 and 1998 for the employment of a project co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>The main aims of the projects are two-fold: to facilitate access at a local level by people with disabilities, including those living in residential settings, to all information, to include details of the range of services available, in appropriate formats, on the issues affecting their lives; to facilitate the active participation by people with disabilities in local area partnerships and enable them to be involved in the decision-making process and play an active part in the life of their community.</P>
    <P>One project worker is employed in each of the projects with the exception of Tallaght-Clondalakin where two project workers are employed on a job-sharing basis.</P>
    <P>The projects are still at the development stage. It is envisaged that the upcoming year will see an increased level of participation by people with disabilities, their families and carers in the work of the projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pilot community action plans, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that community action plans be drawn up to facilitate cross-sectoral planning at local level for the delivery of services to people with disabilities.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that we have recently provided £45,000 in funding for the two pilot community action plans which will focus on transport. The plans will be piloted in Meath and South Mayo and it is intended that they will develop models of good practice which can be replicated in other areas of the country.</P>

      <P>A disability equality unit was established in my Department in April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disability equality unit is responsible for the development of disability policy.  It also provides the administrative backup to the work of <Col N="256" /> various interdepartmental and monitoring committees concerned with matters relating to disability and its staff members actively participate in other such committees.</P>
    <P>The DEU has undertaken the work in relation to the establishment of the National Disability Authority and the disability support service and, as the Deputy will be aware, in November 1997 and in July 1998 we made significant announcements regarding the key infrastructural recommendations of the report relating to the establishment of a national disability authority and a disability support service.  The unit is involved with the processing of the legislation which will put the authority on a statutory footing and, as the Deputy will be aware, the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998 was published recently and is awaiting Second Stage in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made towards achieving the Government commitments in relation to the issue of mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities as well as the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service early in the new year.  In this regard the DEU is working closely with the various Departments and agencies involved in the transfer of departmental responsibilities for a range of services to people with disabilities.  This proposed transfer of responsibilities is designed to facilitate the mainstreaming of training and employment services for people with disabilities and the provision of a comprehensive, accessible information service.</P>
    <P>Staff of the DEU are also responsible for progressing the work on a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which is being prepared by an interdepartmental task force.  The deliberations of the task force will also comprehend the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, entitled, Towards an Independent Future.  The plan is to be presented to me by the end of February next and it is my intention to submit it to Government as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>They are also concerned with delivery of a myriad of programmes which include tasks as diverse as establishing and servicing a monitoring committee to progress the attainment of the 3 per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service, working with the Irish Council of People with Disabilities to facilitate the establishment of a permanent representative council of people with disabilities in 1999, for which funds are being provided by my Department, initiating and funding a range of pilot projects involving community action plans which will facilitate cross-sectoral planning at local level for the delivery of services to people with disabilities and community services projects which will facilitate access at local level by people with disabilities to information in accessible formats and promote participation by people with disabilities in <Col N="257" /> local decision-making processes, organising occasions such as the Irish National Information Day on Disability and the Disability Awareness Week which will take place early in the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In court proceedings where the paternity of a child is in issue, a presumption under the law is that the mother's husband is the father of the child (Status of Children Act, 1987). However, in cases where the mother was living apart from her husband on foot of a separation order or agreement made more than ten months before the birth of the child, the presumption is that the husband is not the father of that child; and if another person is named on the births register as the father of the child, the law presumes that the named person is the father.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary in every case for the husband to be summoned to court (whether in guardianship or any other proceedings) in order to declare that he is not the father of his wife's child.  Such a declaration can, if required and if the husband is available and prepared to make it, be made in writing without court proceedings as part of the process of entering the name of the actual father of the child on the births register (Births and Deaths Registration Acts as amended by the Status of Children Act, 1987).</P>
      <P>Where the parents are in agreement, the law provides that the parents may make a joint declaration to have the father appointed a guardian without the need to go to court (Children Act, 1997).</P>
      <P>There are no further proposals at present to change the law in this area but I can say that operation of the law will continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to introduce a national identity card scheme. However, I have already informed the House, in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 27 and 34 of 20 October 1998, that arrangements for the introduction of a voluntary age card scheme on the basis of provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 are at an advanced stage of preparation. These regulations will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Act provides only for the introduction of a voluntary age card scheme and I have no plans to amend the law in this regard to provide for a mandatory scheme.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that my Department maintains transfer lists for clerical officers who wish to transfer to County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The general position in relation to transfers to provincial areas operated by my Department is that they are arranged in accordance with the standardised transfer system which has been agreed with the Civil and Public Service Union and which applies to all Government Departments and offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement provides that applications for transfers are recorded in order of the date of receipt of each application.  When vacancies arise they must then be offered in this order.  However, in the event that an officer's parent Department may not be in a position to release him/her it may <Col N="263" /> be necessary to go to the next officer on the transfer list.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that my Department is very supportive of the policy of decentralisation and is prepared to release officers selected for transfer under the terms of such schemes.</P>
    <P>I am only aware of one transfer to County Kilkenny granted in the clerical officer grade since 1 January 1998.  While it is assumed that the decentralisation of the Patents Office of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will undoubtedly impact on the transfer lists for clerical officers for that particular location I am not in a position at this time to estimate whether it will result in the depletion of the lists held by my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the operation of the transfer lists for clerical officers generally I am satisfied with the system in place.  Any changes to that system would need to be negotiated under General Council within the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>A total of 6,072 fines on the spot were issued between April 1998 and July 1998 using GATSO. Approximately £250,000 was collected by way of these fines while court imposed fines amounted to £9,000.</P>

These requirements were outlined in the tender procedure notice for the project which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000 per annum, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 363 together.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new funding initiative for the education sector.  At second level, a total of 225 new teachers will be appointed.  Combined with a very significant change to the manner of dealing with over-quota staffing in secondary schools, these new teachers will enable a move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new package will be resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home-school provision.  In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be redeployed, this resource will be <Col N="268" /> utilised in the first instance to meet the remedial and home/school needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of the above package some schools will, nonetheless, have on their staff over quota permanent teachers.  In deciding on whether or not these teachers come within the redeployment scheme, a ratio of 18:1 will be utilised.  The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel.  This will give schools greater certainty in relation to the utilisation of these permanent teachers pending the occurrence of retirements.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the plight of small national schools in Cavan and Monaghan; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that in a school of 43 students the capitation grant is only £2,150, which is an inadequate sum to run the day to day expenses; and if he will increase the amount of £50 per child in order that these rural schools can continue to operate.</Quest>

      <P>I have been made aware of difficulties being experienced by some national schools, including schools in Cavan and Monaghan, in relation to the amount of capitation funding available to them.  The further increase of £10 in the standard rate of capitation grant, which I secured for 1999, will go some way to alleviating these difficulties.</P>
      <P>This latest increase will bring the standard rate of capitation grant to £60 per pupil.  Taken in conjunction with the increase of £5 which I obtained in 1998, this constitutes a 33 per cent increase over the grant in place when I assumed office. These increases represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
      <P>I should point out that schools with an enrolment of less than 60 pupils qualify for a minimum grant, which in 1998 stood at £3,000.  Thus, a school with 43 pupils would have received the minimum grant of £3,000, not £2,150 as mentioned by the Deputy.  The minimum grant for 1999 will be £3,600.</P>

      <P>The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions.  However, there is a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to the scope of the scheme must be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and the competing demands within the education sector.  My priorities in the area of student support <Col N="272" /> have been to introduce a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses in the current academic year and to address the position of mature students under the various grant schemes.  I have no plans at present to extend the scope of the higher education grants scheme to additional colleges.</P>

      <P>My Department endeavours to provide school transport for all children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services.  However, in some cases this is not feasible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost, too long a distance, or the inability of a child to avail of the service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases, my Department offers a grant to the parents or guardians of the pupil concerned to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount of grant payable in such cases depends on the distance involved and the level of school attendance by the pupil.</P>
      <P>I understand that it has not been possible to date to facilitate the child in question on any of the existing transport services operating in the general area in question.  I also understand that the child's parents have asked my Department to review its decision to offer a grant payment towards a private transport arrangement, as they are unable to bring the child to and from school themselves.  My Department is currently investigating whether any alternative transport arrangements can be put in place to facilitate the pupil in question.</P>

      <P>The pace of the work of payment has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making outstanding payments to retired techers before Christmas.

      <P>A number of educational initiatives are in place at school level which are designed to combat the problem of early school leaving and in the process facilitate the attainment of improved levels of literacy.  These include curricular change at first and second levels, the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle pilot projects and the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>In the area of curricular change, it is intended to introduce a revised primary curriculum to schools during 1999.  There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills.  At second level, a new leaving certificate English syllabus will be introduced in 1999.  This will complement the emphasis on functional literacy in the junior certificate English syllabus.</P>
      <P>Funding for adult literacy programmes is a priority of the Government and of my Department. Literacy courses for adults are mainly provided by vocational education committees, with funding from my Department.  Having doubled funding to £5.3 million for literacy courses in 1998, a further £3.2 million has been allocated for the next two years, with the primary objective of increasing the number of clients served by the system, giving priority to those most in need, particularly the unemployed.  In addition, annual grants in aid are awarded to organisations involved in the promotion of literacy.  These amount to £210,000 in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published Green Paper on adult education recognises the need to embark on a <Col N="275" /> multi-faceted national literacy programme, as part of a broadly based and sectorally integrated programme which spans a continuum from early childhood to adulthood, embracing both the formal and non-formal sectors.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.  In addition, as part of a major initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels, I recently announced my intention to extend the home-school-community liaison service to all schools with disadvantaged status.</P>
      <P>My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 365 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>The objective of the middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programme is to enhance industrial competitiveness and growth by providing initial third level education and training to meet the technical and higher level manpower needs of the economy and the regulations emphasise the extent to which training conditions mirror the reality of the work environment, thereby preparing trainees for the workplace.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical/business skills programme state that: &ldquo;Trainees on the programmes will be subject to normal industrial disciplines during training regarding time keeping, absenteeism etc., and the institute authorities will be required to reflect these factors in the payment of allowances.  Trainees may be allowed sick leave without reduction in the level of grant for a maximum of 15 days per academic year.  All such absences must be notified to the institute authorities in writing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Normal industrial discipline refers to the normal conditions which exist in the workplace, for example, notifying absences due to illness in writing to the college authorities.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme allow for the payments of grants in three equal instalments.  These grants are paid on the basis of the student continuing to be a registered student at college rather than a roll call taken on a daily basis which is the system which operates on ESF aided courses in the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The method of payment of grants under the various student support schemes is one of the issues which will be addressed in the context of the review of the administration of the third level student support schemes which is being undertaken by officials of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>In 1997, my Department allocated funds to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACALD, to assist in their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas.  My Department is at present considering a request for additional funding for the ACALD.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  If necessary, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on their level of difficulty, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible. I assure the Deputy that the needs of children with specific learning disability will be fully considered in this context.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £50,000 has been allocated to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities.</P>

      <P>My Department currently provides a psychological service to primary schools in 14 counties.  This means there still remain many schools without access to my Department's psychological service, including primary schools in County Laois.  To ensure that the highest standards of professional practice are maintained, it is necessary that the expansion of the psychological service into all areas should take place in a phased and orderly manner, as resources become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels.  On 15 September, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced.  Last week, I announced the allocation of £1.5 million to provide for the establishment and initial staffing of the service over the next two years.  Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in 1999.  It is my intention that the national educational psychological service will be available <Col N="283" /> to all schools by the end of the five year implementation phase.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the planning group's report is that the national educational psychological service should be co-ordinated with psychological services in the health sector.  Consultations with these services, including those provided by the Midland Health Board, will begin shortly in order to reach agreement on respective roles and client groups.  In this way, it is hoped to ensure that as many students as possible have access to psychological help, even during the implementation period.</P>
    <P>The needs of primary school pupils with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  The advice of my Department's primary inspectorate is also available to schools in which there are children with specific learning disability.</P>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those problems which are accompanied by specific perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the national training programme for remedial teachers, which my Department funds, includes a module on specific learning disability. I announced last week in my post-budget statement that, from next September, a remedial teacher service will be available to all primary schools.  It is intended that each remedial teacher will deal with no more than approximately 30 pupils.  This represents a substantial improvement in the availability of remedial help for children with learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep the needs of children with specific learning disability under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>A revised primary school curriculum is being finalised under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and will shortly be presented to me for ratification.  The revised curriculum will contain a subject block to be known as &ldquo;social, environmental and scientific education&rdquo;.  This will comprise the three subject areas history, geography and science.  While elementary science did form a component in the social and environmental studies programme for 5th and 6th classes in the 1971 curriculum, it was formally taught only in a small minority of schools.  In the revised curriculum, science will <Col N="284" /> hold equal standing with history and geography for all classes and will be given an appropriate weekly time allocation.</P>
      <P>The new science programme will consist of four interlinked strands, namely living things, energy and forces, materials and environmental care. The strand on environmental care will embrace substrands on environmental awareness, dealing with the study of physical and human environments, including the positive and negative effects which human activities can have on ecosystems, and the study of local, national and global environmental issues.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special care needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The school in question is one of a number of schools which have applied to my Department for child care assistant support.  All such applications are now being considered in the context of this new arrangement and I would expect that additional allocations of child care assistant support will commence shortly and continue through 1999.</P>

      <P>At second level the junior certificate syllabi in home economics, especially through its test in culinary skills, and science deal with apsects of food safety and hygiene.  Almost all junior certificate pupils take either home economics or science. A revision of the home economics syllabus at leaving certificate level is being finalised.  This will incorporate aspects of all recent legislative changes in relation to food safety.  Aspects of food safety and hygiene are present in the microbiology section of the biology syllabus.  Over twothirds of the leaving certificate cohort take either home economics or biology.</P>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism can be capable of functioning in ordinary <Col N="291" /> schools, with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs were traditionally catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild mental handicap or schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as part of a major new development in special education services, I have confirmed my Department's formal recognition of the distinct educational needs <Col N="292" /> of certain children with autism.  In respect of such children, I have confirmed that separate educational provision will henceforth be made available at a pupil teacher ratio of 6 : 1, together with child care support for each special class of six children.</P>
    <P>To date, a total of 14 such special classes have been established in mainstream primary schools and a further nine such classes in special schools. Further provision will be made available for children with autism, where required, on a similar basis.</P>
