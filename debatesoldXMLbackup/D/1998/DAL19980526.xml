    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14 together.</P>
      <P>The people have endorsed the British-Irish Agreement in overwhelming numbers.  More than 71 per cent of the voters in the North and close to 95 per cent in the South &mdash; 85 per cent of all those voting on the island &mdash; have bestowed on it not just political force but true moral force.  The people have shown clearly and emphatically that they want peace, that they want an accommodation and that they want to work together for the benefit of everyone, North and South, and for the benefit of the islands of Ireland and Britain.  There is now no greater claim to authority, no greater claim to legitimacy, than the collective voice of the people recorded last Friday.</P>
      <P>The decision of the people to endorse this Agreement was not simply a political act.  It was a command to all political leaders to begin the work of peace.  It is now the responsibility of everybody engaged in the political process to make the Agreement work.  We all have to engage constructively together to ensure all aspects of the Agreement are put in place.</P>
      <P>I have always said this Agreement will bring real, tangible benefits.  It is now time to make the Agreement a reality.  Reaching agreement in the multi-party talks was a long and arduous process.  It will take an even greater commitment by all of us to realise the full vision set out in the Agreement.</P>
      <P>During my recent contacts with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, our focus had been to maximise the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.  This was also my priority in all my recent contacts, including with Lord Alderdice, whom I met on 19 May.</P>
      <P>On 17 and 18 May, I visited the United States. My primary engagement was to accept an honorary doctorate degree at Boston College, where I made a speech on the British-Irish Agreement to the assembled audience.  I also took the opportunity to attend an Ireland-Israel-US software conference which was a showcase to investors by a number of innovative companies in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my trip to Scotland on 9 May I met Mr. Donald Dewar MP, the Scottish Secretary of <Col N="367" /> State, Mr. Brian Wilson MP, Minister of State for Education and Industry at the Scottish Office, Mr. Alex Salmond MP, the leader of the Scottish National Party, Mr. Frank McAveety, Leader of Glasgow District Council and other elected public representatives.  In our discussions, we covered the implications of strand three of the British-Irish Agreement and the institutions which will be set up on that basis, connecting the interests of Scotland and Ireland and how we could best promote these.  I also had a meeting with Cardinal Winning of Glasgow.</P>
    <P>In my reply to questions on 12 May I explained that the previous weekend I had met some of the families of those who are missing.  This is an issue I have continued to raise with republican sources, and which I will continue to raise until we have had a satisfactory answer which will put an end to the suffering of these families.  I welcome the promise made by Gerry Adams last week to try to help rectify the injustice whereby a family has been bereaved and the body has not been returned to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not refer to the Amsterdam Treaty referendum result? Will he rectify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I should have done so.  I am extremely pleased that it was carried successfully, although the majority was not as high as I would have wished.  As I said over the weekend in many statements, we have often had 30 per cent of the vote against in a referendum. While the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote was quite high, it did not give cause for great concern.  I would have liked a higher &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote but in a good poll more than 60 per cent emphatically supported the Amsterdam Treaty.  The information available in the public domain was sufficient but, as I said over the weekend and in the House, the arrangements for holding a referendum warrant examination. That is what I intend to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In interpreting the result of the Amsterdam Treaty referendum the Taoiseach stated that it was his view that there was no support in Ireland for federalism.  Will he elaborate on this?  Is he aware that the Maastricht Treaty commits this country to an ever closer union of the peoples of Europe which, in essence, involves federalism?  Do the statements he made after the Amsterdam Treaty referendum result represent a turning away from a European Union by his party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows nobody did more work than my party and the Government to make sure that referendum was passed.  I supported the provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty. European integration and the concept of federalism put forward by some people mean two different things.  I wholeheartedly welcome European integration and what will happen in the enlargement <Col N="368" /> process.  I have supported what has happened in that process and I have supported in every way possible the countries which are in various stages of accession.  As I said last week, people here have a strong view on neutrality issues, but there was some confusion about those issues in the campaign because some people put forward views on issues not covered by or mentioned in the treaty.  During the campaign we managed to explain to the people the issues involved as best we could under the circumstances that prevailed.  The people voted overwhelmingly by 60 per cent to 40 per cent for the treaty, which is a good majority in any referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the scale of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, the highest ever in any of the referenda we have had on the European issue, is a cause for concern, particularly for European institutions?  Will he also agree that if that result were repeated in other countries, it might lead to the Amsterdam Treaty not being ratified, in Denmark for example, because of the scale of disenchantment? Does the Government intend to adopt a more proactive view or position on European institutions?  For example, does it intend to propose that the Council of Ministers meetings should be open to the public or the media and be broadcast?  Does it intend to endorse the recent call by the former President, Jacques Delors, that the process of electing the new President of the Commission, which is due to take place in less than 18 months, should be done in a transparent and democratic manner?  Are those matters to which the Government intends to give its attention, as the Taoiseach stated in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the referendum was quite high.  As Deputy Quinn will be aware from the only analysis carried out two reasons for it were put forward.  Some people said there was a lack of information on the treaty, but I do not accept that.  There was a great deal of information and the media carried a great deal of data on it daily, even though two referenda were being held on the same day.  The other reason given was the neutrality issue, which is not part of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider question of the Amsterdam Treaty, following the Maastricht Treaty people said that such matters should be made more Europe friendly.  As I said two weeks ago, a good attempt was made to do that by examining issues that affect people's daily lives such as crime and unemployment.  I accept the legal text of the treaty must be put forward, but I do not believe many people studied it.  However, there was a high demand for the White Paper which was available in public libraries, information centres and citizen advice bureaux and it was checked many times since last January.  That may come as a surprise to some people, but that is the case.  I am aware from meetings I attended throughout <Col N="369" /> the country that the document put forward by the Referendum Commission was well analysed.</P>
    <P>European institutions must strive to make European matters a part of people's daily lives and ensure people genuinely feel those issues affect them.  Many people thought the type of issues covered by the Amsterdam Treaty should not be put to the people, but that is the procedure provided for under our Constitution.  I have answered questions on chat programmes, local radio programmes and at public meetings around the country.  European institutions should constantly strive to explain their role, not only when there is a referendum on the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty or the Amsterdam Treaty. Deputy Quinn will recall the ECOFIN Council and other councils have allowed televised broadcasts of their way of doing business, which is a good way of making them more open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share the Taoiseach's analysis and do not disagree with him, does the Government intend taking a proactive position in relation to this matter?  Will the Government consider proposing that the process of selecting the next President of the EU Commission be conducted in a much more open, transparent and democratic manner, in contrast with the manner in which Jacques Santer was selected?  At the next Council meeting in Cardiff will the Taoiseach propose that henceforth all proceedings of Council of Ministers meetings be open to the public as the proceedings of this House are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give decisions on issues the Government has not discussed. However, I support the principle of trying to make the workings of the EU Commission, Councils and other meetings more open and understandable to the public.  I will be glad to put forward any initiatives the Government may decide upon following its reflection on last week's vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the referenda on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Northern Ireland Agreement.  Does the Taoiseach agree that attempts by some people in Northern Ireland to achieve pacts on the basis of a sectarian head count are unhelpful in terms of elections to the assembly and that the objective ought to be to have the broadest number of people elected who are pro the Agreement and the assembly and its operation?  Given that we are entering the election campaign for the assembly and the potential damage which problems over marches can give rise to, will the Taoiseach urge a voluntary moratorium on all marches by all sides for the summer in order to give the people of Northern Ireland a chance to heal the wounds of the past 30 years and enable the Agreement to bed down?  In this regard will the Taoiseach consider inviting the Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, to address the Dáil as a mark of our appreciation of the excellent co-operation <Col N="370" /> between the two Governments in putting the Agreement together with the parties in Northern Ireland?  It would enable us to express our appreciation of that co-operation which opens a new era of co-operation between our two states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding sectarian groupings or pacts, I would rather see people looking to what will best make the Agreement work.  The people have voted and the result of Friday's referendum on the Agreement is a message of hope, particularly in the North where people voted in enormous numbers.  The people of Northern Ireland obviously have a passion for peace and they have spoken there and in the South in the clearest and loudest possible manner, putting hope back into the island after 30 years of giving up on hope.  The result was a good one for the country.  We are moving to the next phase with an overwhelming majority endorsement of the Agreement.  People want to see the democratic wish they expressed last week carried out.  If we are to have peace and stability all aspects of the Agreement must work.  A very important part of it is the Assembly, the institutional mechanism charged with making so much of the Agreement work.  I encourage those voting in the elections to think carefully before voting and to vote on the basis of electing people who will contribute constructively to making it work.  It is not for me to say how anybody should vote, but I ask that the wishes of the people be recognised and reflected in the Assembly, something I hope will happen.</P>
      <P>Regarding other initiatives, I have noted what the Deputy said about inviting the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to the House.  I hope Prime Minister Blair will visit Ireland in the near future to discuss the Agreement and other matters with me at Government level.  I will consider other initiatives over the longer term.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa inquired some weeks ago about following up on the initiatives contained in the Agreement.  An interdepartmental group, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is considering all of the initiatives contained therein and has begun to process those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to give active consideration to inviting the British Prime Minister to address the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Amsterdam Treaty, does the Taoiseach agree that, in spite of the Referendum Commission's job in regard to the distribution of information, political debate is clearly required on issues of this kind?  The presentation of neutral information pro and anti a particular position was insufficient to generate interest in what is essentially an EU political agreement.  We must seriously consider an alternative means of ensuring that real political debate occurs around issues such as the development of the EU; information on its own is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Government intend to examine the referendum returns by constituency to ascertain <Col N="371" /> the socio-economic breakdown of those who voted for and against the Treaty?  At a cursory glance, it appears to me that the most marginalised constituencies displayed least enthusiasm for the EU, perhaps because they do not feel its benefits.</P>
    <P>EU treaties will be further revised in the coming years.  Will that process of revision be brought more into the open in terms of debate on the issues involved?  There is no doubt in my mind that the very public debate which took place on the Northern Agreement, in which the various issues were thrashed out, resulted in people being in a position to judge the issues for themselves. However, in regard to the Amsterdam Treaty, people were presented with a series of amendments to a complex treaty almost overnight and were unaware of its possible impact on their daily lives.  A more open process of debate, which would include the Dáil and other public fora, on the future revision of European treaties would result in a more informed electorate at the time of referenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little doubt that recent court judgments have hampered the conduct of Government referenda campaigns.  In my view, the current regime is overly restrictive and makes it difficult to communicate the effect of a referendum proposal to the people.  The Government allocated substantial resources to the Referendum Commission which did an excellent job within the constraints imposed upon it in regard to the conveyance of information in both referenda. However, the onus on the commission to meet every argument in favour with a contrary argument does not realistically deal with the matter nor does it reflect the concerns of the people, as can be seen from the 95 per cent vote in favour of the British-Irish Agreement even though the commission was obliged to balance the arguments for and against that agreement.  I do not believe that is the correct approach.  It should be reviewed and we intend to review it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa with regard to the constituencies.  We have not yet carried out an analysis of the vote by constituency but a brief glance at the results suggests that urban areas which suffer higher unemployment and greater social disadvantage yielded a higher &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>Two areas must be examined in the next process, the issues which were not completed in the Amsterdam Treaty and enlargement of the Union and what that will mean for the Commission, majority voting and so forth.  There will be a review and there will also be limited discussion in Cardiff about that process which is due to start again and which might take some years to complete.  The Deputy's proposal as to how that should be done is worth examining.  I am willing to reflect on it and how it should be done as we move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was directly involved in the referenda on the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act <Col N="372" /> some years ago.  The difficulty with those and the Amsterdam Treaty is that they are complex legal texts which are not easy to understand.  The Amsterdam Treaty in some ways offered more real advantages for people.  I am sure other Members of the House who attended a large number of public meetings on this issue found that the question which most often arose was why, having voted for Europe in 1972, 1987 and 1992, people were once again being asked to vote on it.  When they looked at the documents and tried to get their heads around matters such as the Schengen Agreement, it was not easy to explain them.  I had this difficulty with employer groups, trade unions and community groups.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is caused by how we have organised our constitutional amendments.  It causes confusion and the public has expressed that confusion. It was, therefore, easy for some people to say that if one was in doubt, one should vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I met many people from all political parties who said it was the easiest option and they appear to have used that option for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly endorse Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that Prime Minister Blair should be invited to address a joint session of the Dáil and Seanad.  It is ironic that joint sessions of the Houses have been addressed by the German Chancellor, the President of France, three Presidents of the United States and other heads of state but not by the Prime Minister of Britain, our nearest neighbour.  Now that there are normalised relations with Britain it is about time we invited the British Prime Minister to address a joint session of the Houses and stopped maintaining the constitutional fiction that our relationship with Britain is different from our relationship with other states.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the issues that could cause problems during the summer is parades in Northern Ireland?  Does he further agree that a solution might be found if the Orange Order would agree to meet all residents' groups and if, in return, the residents would agree to allow parades of a non-confrontational type to pass with relatively modest frequency through their areas?  Does he agree that a compromise can be found on that basis?  Now that the people have endorsed the Agreement, it is time for flexibility on the part of both the Orange Order and the residents' groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is true that if people would compromise, progress could be made on this issue.  I am not aware of the views of some of the committees of the Orange Order following last Friday.  Prior to that date their stated position was that the Orange Order and the Loyal Lodges would meet the residents but they wish to have a veto over who represents the residents.  This has been an issue for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, as a result of a difficulty with the Orange Order meeting certain residents, the residents elected their representatives to public <Col N="373" /> office positions.  The Orange lodges will not meet leaders elected by the community and the public at large.  That remained the position up to last Friday.  I agree with Deputy Bruton, but if both sides could be moved on this issue progress could be made.  It is entirely reasonable that there is compromise.  Out of the hundreds of marches that take place about a dozen are contentious and difficult. If compromise could be reached by a twoway process, progress could be made.  I am due to meet residents' groups shortly.  Last year I met the Orange lodges and people who have some say with both sides and I asked them to see if compromise can be reached.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if the good work of recent months was undone by difficult positions being taken up because people will not meet.  I am not saying there will be agreement when they meet, but if there was some dialogue it would open up the possibility of seeking compromise.  I do not wish to understate the position.  Most compromises that have been considered in the past three years have been rejected, but in the aftermath of last Friday it is worth considering them again.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: On the Amsterdam Treaty, is the Taoiseach astonished that the political parties which achieved more than 90 per cent of votes of the electorate in the recent general election and which favoured carrying the treaty were rejected by almost 40 per cent of the electorate who voted against the treaty?  In view of what the Taoiseach said about the complexities of the matter, will he agree those of us who said the referendum should have been put back until the autumn to allow wider discussion to take place were right?  Will he agree the result shows there is great concern about the military provisions in the treaty?  The people have stated categorically that not only do they believe this country should not participate in adventures of a military kind but they do not want to be seen to encourage the EU to move in that direction, whether in terms of military formation, an armaments industry or a nuclear capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the health service comes under one of the joint committees set up by the Agreement and in view of proposals for severe cutbacks in the health services in the North, will the Taoiseach ask the British Prime Minister to freeze cuts until the assembly is set up and the position is taken in hand by local administrations?  Is the Taoiseach aware that tonight in Dungannon up <Col N="374" /> to 20,000 people are expected to protest against the rundown of the south Tyrone hospital?</P>

Any country in the European Union would be satisfied with such a high turnout on polling day.  While I had mixed feelings about holding the referenda on separate dates, I am now convinced we made the correct decision to hold them on the same day.

I thank all the non-political people who, since last January, worked extremely hard campaigning for Europe.  I also thank Deputy Dukes and other parliamentarians who worked extremely hard throughout the winter in this regard.  It would have been unfair to those people, who campaigned with very limited resources, to delay the referendum until the autumn. A large amount of information was disseminated on the matter and a large number of people turned out to vote.</P>
      <P>I have already commented on our position in regard to neutrality.  The commitment given by all the major parties that any change in that stance in future discussions on Europe will be put to the people stands.  It was not an issue in this case.</P>

In view of the satisfaction expressed by a large number of people about polling stations being open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, will the Government confirm this will be the conventional norm for all future elections?

      <P>A large number of people suggested that, like those in Northern Ireland, polling stations here should have opened at 7 a.m. That matter deserves consideration.  Some members of my party carried out 40 polls across Dublin on the numbers voting at particular times during the day and, as in December last, they showed very few people voted after 8 p.m. The poll between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. was lower than at any other time during the day.</P>

While I believe Friday is more appropriate than Saturday, the figures do not show that more people turn out to vote on Friday.  However, it facilitates some people.  Even though we extended the postal vote and the late register in recent years, it is still difficult to achieve more than a 50 per cent turnout in elections.</P>

      <P>I tabled a question to the Taoiseach on the referendum but for some reason it was transferred to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I join the Taoiseach in welcoming the result of the referendum on the Belfast Agreement.</P>
      <P>On the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, the Taoiseach said the interpretation of the McKenna case was overly restrictive.  I agree with him on that.  Can the Taoiseach explain why the summary of the White Paper, which is quite a good document in terms of its objectivity, was not more widely circulated to people?  It was a relatively small document.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, simply because people are sceptical or opposed to this phase of European integration, it does not necessarily mean they are anti-Europe?  Will he accept in good faith that they would describe themselves as pro-actively European in terms of a critical analysis of their involvement?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also take in good faith the point made by people that their lack of information, as they perceived it, was a genuine reason for voting &ldquo;no&ldquo;?  The Schengen Agreement, to which the Taoiseach referred was not available in any library or anywhere else as far as I could see. That this information was not generally available was mentioned on various chat shows.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Scotland, did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to raise with any of the authorities there Strand 3 of the Belfast Agreement regarding the Council of the Isles?  Earlier, we discussed the suggestion concerning the islands of the North Atlantic, under the acronym IONA. Did that gain any favour in Scotland, particularly? Did the Taoiseach mention it or was it the subject of any discussion during his visit to Scotland?</P>

Will he agree that one of the ways in which this momentum could be maintained is in relation to &ldquo;the disappeared&ldquo;?  A number of Members of the House are becoming very dissatisfied that no progress is being made on this matter.</P>
      <P>Will he also agree that, in terms of the possibility of making progress on Orange marches, perhaps Mr. David Trimble might contact his constituents, particularly in Portadown, to sort this out?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach further agree that what is needed for the immediate future and well into the future is an emphasis on building bridges between the two traditions in Northern Ireland, rather than any pan-nationalism that might be suggested in certain quarters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins.  I am glad our constituents ignored his advice to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the <Col N="377" /> referendum on Northern Ireland.  His advice on the south Tyrone hospital in Dungannon would not be welcomed by people like my brother who is leading the campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the people's overwhelming endorsement of the Belfast Agreement was assisted by the removal of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act which prohibited the broadcasting of certain people's utterances? I ask this question in view of the widespread dissent at that action at the time.</P>
      <P>As regards the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, is it not the case that the size of the poll and the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote were so significant because market considerations since the treaties to which the Taoiseach referred, passed in 1972, 1982 and 1987, have been taken entirely out of context to the extent that they wipe out every other consideration? Continued discussion of the process of eliminating obstacles in the marketplace to the exclusion of every other right in the treaties &mdash; the right of free competition has been taken out of context to the extent of suppressing other rights &mdash; has led to considerable disillusion about the European Union.  We are preparing for the European elections next year.  However, the suppression of the European social agenda and the total silence on the cultural aspects of Europe have been damaging and concentration on market considerations has disillusioned the population in relation to Europe.  A cynic might say that having taken most of the advantages in terms of the economy and having heard nothing about the other dimensions of the treaty, a considerable gap has been created between Europe and Ireland.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Sargent's comment on the White Paper, while it was not sent to every household, it was widely circulated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that it would be available in libraries and agencies. Anybody who raised questions about it with any Department, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs, was given a copy of it.  Perhaps it was not circulated as widely as it should have been, but it was freely available.</P>
      <P>I accept the people's decision should not be regarded as anti-European.  I do not believe that 38 per cent of the people are against the Amsterdam Treaty.  Many were of the view that they did not know a great deal about it.  Perhaps they did not bother to listen to the arguments or they found them confusing so they decided to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We must all take some responsibility for this.  I assume that many people would be in favour of other issues relating to Europe.  The message, &ldquo;when in doubt, put it out&rdquo;, is easy to get across.  That was the only message of some people in the campaign.  It would have been nice if they had a political ideology other than saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We condemn other people for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That is people's prerogative in political life but it is not a clear message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> As regards Deputy Sargent's point about the Council, I discussed that at length with the Secretary of State and with other politicians.  Scottish politicians are as anxious as I am to avail of the opportunity to develop the council concept.  It is a long time since the Republic had political contact with Scotland.  Such contact was always with the United Kingdom and Westminster.  That point was repeatedly made to me by the Scottish representatives.  Deputy Currie referred to political momentum.  I made the point that of the aspects of the Agreement we have to implement some are legislative and some are administrative. Decommissioning and prisoners issues will always get more of the limelight but reform of the criminal justice system, the equality agenda and the human and civil rights agenda are equally important.  A range of things need to be done. Both the Northern Ireland Office and the British Government are doing them.  They are quickly filling the various positions.  In relation to Orange marches, we will do whatever we can.  I hope all politicians, including Mr. Trimble and others, will do all they can to help to de-escalate the tension that always arises on these issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question about market issues is a fair point.  I have said that the European Community should be about people's issues, including unemployment and crime.  Parts of the Amsterdam <Col N="379" /> Treaty were about those issues but the European Commission and the European Union, in which we are all involved, should try to highlight it.  As anyone who has ever been a Minister is aware, there tends to be just one item on the agenda in which the lobbyists will have a huge interest and that is the reason debate on the treaty has been dominated by market issues rather than the effect on people.  On the European Social Fund, an enormous amount of resources is used in helping to alleviate social exclusion and for other issues but it is not a huge item on the agenda.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems, to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their systems and to determine the solution.  There is no way of preventing or avoiding the costs associated with solving this serious problem.  The level of cost and the economic impact in any case, will depend on the extent of the problem within each business.  It is important that Irish businesses urgently address this complex issue, as the cost of ignoring this problem could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem immediately.  Government can only help in raising awareness of this issue and by providing guidelines to businesses to assist them in tackling the problem.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 copies of an awareness leaflet on the year 2000 computer problem, prepared by our Department in June 1997 with the assistance of Forfás and IBEC, have been distributed to industry, chambers of commerce, professional bodies, State agencies and county and city enterprise boards throughout the country.  This leaflet suggests initial steps to be taken to enable industry's IT systems deal with the date change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some recent research on the year 2000 problem, has indicated that while there is a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action to deal with it particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is urgently required.  Accordingly on 6 May last I launched a further awareness campaign with which I am constantly involved.  A further and more comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it, has been circulated to businesses, both <Col N="380" /> directly and indirectly, through industrial development agencies, county and city enterprise boards, chambers of commerce and other professional bodies.  I arranged to have copies of this brochure circulated to all Deputies and Senators. In addition a series of regional public meetings are being held to highlight awareness of the problem and the urgency of the need to address the issue immediately.</P>
    <P>My Department and I have also had discussions with representatives of the financial sector, the insurance industry, the accountancy bodies and various other professionals, both national and international, including the IT sector, to seek their assistance in highlighting the need for Irish businesses to take immediate action.  These interests have agreed to support the Government's campaign and I have established a national steering committee, representing a range of relevant business organisations and State agencies, to oversee the campaign and implement it at the level of their constituent membership.</P>

If, as I understand, it was set up only in the past month or two, is he satisfied that is a sufficient lead-in time for people to be prepared given that, in his leaflet, he said some of the problems would be met by the end of 1998 when the timers click in to 1999?  Will he consider making interest-free loans available to companies who cannot find the resources to prepare themselves for the changeover in the year 2000?  Is he aware that issues such as traffic lights, lifts, refrigeration systems and anything which has an embedded chip is also likely to be affected and that his campaign appears to affect only the computer on the desk?  Will he ensure specific training for specific businesses is provided?</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of all the matters to which Deputy Owen has referred.  To say we are not taking this matter seriously is far removed from the truth.  We established a national co-ordinating committee last year which has worked assiduously on the matter.  That committee was revamped and converted into a national steering <Col N="381" /> committee, representing all the professional bodies and many professionals in their own right and various business organisations.  This is an excellent national committee doing tremendous work.</P>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not suffering from amnesia but she will be aware she sat at a Cabinet table which took a decision that it would be a matter purely for businesses to resolve issues pertaining to IT and the resolution of the year 2000 problem.  This Government has renewed that decision.  The computer systems in private sector industry are matters for that industry.  Our job is to ensure on a macro basis that businesses are fully aware of the seriousness of this complex problem and that they will have to take immediate action to deal with it.  We have alerted businesses throughout the country to this problem.  A series of regional public meetings are taking place with the full support of the national steering committee, the constituent organisations and the professional bodies involved.  These regional meetings are well supported.</P>
      <P>We will continue to work assiduously on this problem in the coming months to ensure all businesses take the necessary action.  Given the seriousness of this matter I circulated all Deputies with the brochure.  We have been commended by the European Commission on the brochure and the information contained therein.  We are pleased about that and it shows it has made a major impact not alone in this country but across Europe.  I hope we have the full support of all the elected Members of both this House and Seanad Éireann.  I commend Seanad Éireann for having a positive debate on this matter and I am confident that if everybody plays their part we will ensure that the historic opportunities that are available, not just politically but economically, will not be impeded by the latent difficulties being created by the year 2000 problem.  I hope everybody, elected representatives and others, will play an individual part so that collectively we can ensure this problem is resolved to the satisfaction of our country's economic future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the little lecture.  Is he not aware that the distribution of 100,000 leaflets is not sufficient to make an impact on the companies that will be affected? A recent survey showed that despite a two year information campaign, 61 per cent of companies said they were not ready for the introduction of the euro in January next.  Will the Minister of State review the methodology he is using to stimulate the companies to become aware of the seriousness of this problem?  With no disrespect to him, that leaflet is not enough to make companies aware of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consider making an interest free loan available so that companies will have the resources to make the necessary changes?  Will he consider a more specific training programme for specific sectors?  Holding generalised seminars in the various hotels the Minister of State mentioned will not be enough to deal <Col N="382" /> with this problem.  We know from practice that it is not enough to prepare people for the euro.  I ask the Minister to put his Department's enormous resources, and his own intellect, behind some different method of making companies aware of the changes needed.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State had any discussions with software manufacturers in regard to making the devices they are implementing available to companies throughout the country?  I understand work is ongoing in those companies to find new programmes to help deal with this problem.

      <P>The Deputy seems to have misinterpreted what I said.  We produced our first brochure in June last and circulated 100,000 of those throughout the country.  We then reviewed the position and produced a new brochure recently, approximately 150,000 copies of which have been circulated.  I have had discussions at the highest level, both nationally and internationally, with various computer companies and software producers as well as the Irish Software Association and others.  Outstanding advice has been made available to us from some of the world's leading manufacturers of computers and software systems, both nationally and internationally.  We visited some of those manufacturers for other reasons and discussed the matter with them.  We talked specifically to some companies and others came to this country at our request to advise us. In addition, all of the professional organisations, including the Irish Bankers' Federation, the accountancy organisations, IBEC and others, are taking action on this matter.  Dedicated organisations like the banks, the building societies and others are also taking specific action and we are deeply involved with them in those areas.  This is a three-pronged approach by the individual companies, their professional bodies and representative organisations supported by the Government awareness campaign.  Following each regional conference, my officials and I will review strategy and the Deputy can be absolutely certain that with the Tánaiste and my colleague, Deputy Kitt, our Department will leave no stone unturned to ensure all of the organisations as well as small, medium and large businesses will be fully aware of the seriousness of this problem.  We ask them to get the message across and co-operate so that everybody will be up to speed by 9 September 1999.</P>

I understand they require additional staff to get their computer, payroll and ordering systems ready.  Will he have discussions also with Ministers across the board?  Is the Minister's own Department ready for the change or will we have to rescue him, the Tánaiste and Minister Kitt <Col N="383" /> from the lifts in the Department on 1 January 2000?  Will they have to be rescued when the alarm system goes off and they are unable to get in or out of their building because everything will be locked?

      <P>I hope the Deputy does not commit hara-kiri over this issue between now and the deadline.  She can be absolutely certain that her assistance will not be required because we will be in a position to comply.  We have answered a series of questions on this issue.  My responsibility is in the business area.  The Government has taken this matter very seriously.  The Cabinet has considered it on a number of occasions.  A national committee, chaired by the Minister for Finance, is working on this with all Government Departments. I have had discussions with various Departments regarding this matter but it is the role of the Minister for Finance to co-ordinate the Government campaign for the State agencies. The Deputy can be assured that all of the State agencies are responding to each departmental demand to ensure they can comply by September next.  In addition, we are spending £13 million, as I informed the House on another occasion, on improving and providing new computer systems in various Departments.  No stone will be left unturned by this Government in regard to this problem.  Each Minister will provide a report every two months to Cabinet and to the national committee under the chairmanship of the Minister for Finance on all of the agencies under their remit.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the offer of the Deputy's assistance but the assistance we require is that she gets the message across that this problem is serious.  We want the businesses involved in the regional conferences to take urgent action by way of audits and assurance assessments of their systems so that the professionals will be in a position to respond to them and not wait until later this year or early next year when all the professions will be tied up with the amount of work that will be involved.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland will be an entirely new agency with a distinctive mission and strategy.  The agency will not be a simple amalgamation of the existing programmes and practices currently pursued by Forbairt, An Bord Trachtála and the services to business division of FÁS.</P>
      <P>The purpose of establishing Enterprise Ireland is to streamline the number of supports currently in operation in the different agencies and to provide for a more structured development process reflecting the needs and developmental challenges of Irish business.</P>
      <P>The intention is to provide Enterprise Ireland with the necessary expertise to enable it to provide a complete and comprehensive service both to individual client companies and to the product and market sectors within which those companies operate.  The key criteria for assessing the performance of the new agency will be the extent to which firms are able to expand profitable sales, boost exports and increase employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that good enough?  We are within weeks of the establishment of this agency under Dan Flinter and Pat Molloy.  The Minister's Department recently produced a document, Enterprise Ireland Mission Strategy &mdash; Clients and Functions.  Throughout this short preparatory period there seems to have been little or no consultation with staff in the various agencies involved.  In relation to services to businesses, a number of options are considered on page 13 of that document.  No decisions have been taken even though we are within weeks of this agency being established.  The document states that three major sections of Forbairt &mdash; I understand Forbairt in Glasnevin will be the major area &mdash; will be closed down and that some of the functions currently exercised by Forbairt would not transfer to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is rushing this development. There have been only a few weeks of preparation and now she is expecting the chief executive, Mr. Flinter, and Mr. Pat Molloy to be responsible perhaps over a number of years for the industrial relations fallout which is bound to ensue. <Col N="385" /> A businessman said to me that the Japanese tend to strategically plan things for a number of years and then implement them in a couple of weeks, while the Spanish planned a recent development for a couple of weeks and implemented it painfully over a number of years. The Minister is behaving more like a Spanish than a Japanese Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a fact, borne out during my recent tour of Forbairt, that many of the Forbairt staff are demoralised.  The Minister has not consulted them.  There have been no consultations to date despite the fact that we are a few weeks away from the culmination of this new agency.  The Minister is guillotining through this new agency without clearly having thought out what she is going to achieve.  She is abandoning the old adage &ldquo;if it is not broken, do not fix it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The upshot is that there will be a significant number of redundancies.  The Minister is not prepared to face the workers in the agencies concerned. She will leave it to the chief executive, Mr. Flinter, and his staff to spend the early years of the organisation engaged in industrial relations processes rather than in the strategic mission of Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <P>What is being done here was recommended by Culliton in the late 1980s.  It is not a question of &ldquo;if it is not broken, do not fix it&rdquo;&mdash; it is broken.  Irish companies are not as profitable as they should be.  They have not diversified into markets in which they should be.  The majority of the exports of the SMEs are into the UK.  They have not taken good sectional positioning in niche markets to develop their potential.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this restructuring is to ensure that we focus on the needs of companies, not on what agencies think are their needs.  There are 45 different ways of helping companies through three different agencies.  That is unsatisfactory and time consuming.  Many small companies do not have the competence to access the kind of aid which is required.  We have no way of measuring the performance of the agencies because each agency claims it was their input which helped bring about a transformation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amalgamation is to improve the competitive position of industry, particularly in the context of the global economy which is more competitive and the environment where there is a single currency.  It will be particularly important because of the dependency which Irish companies have on the UK.</P>

      <P>Many functions were given to Forbairt when it was established in 1993 which should not rightly be there.  They have nothing to do with company development.  Those areas of activity will find an appropriate home but that home is not with the new agency, Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>There will be no forced redundancies.  I do not know if there will be voluntary redundancies. Clearly, if there are to be redundancies they will be voluntary.  If the new management and board, in agreement with the workers, decide there should be redundancies on a voluntary basis in a particular area, that is a matter we should allow to be decided between those two groups.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Broughan said, there have been extensive consultations throughout with the workers and their representatives.  I have consulted with them.  The document to which the Deputy referred was published with a view to helping that consultative process.</P>
      <P>It is important that we establish this agency quickly.  The legislation will be published next week.  I intend to enter into discussions with the Opposition spokespeople with a view to agreeing a timescale for taking it through the Oireachtas. To avoid any uncertainty and to allow the agency to establish itself quickly, it is important that the legislation is passed as quickly as possible.  I hope I have the Deputy's co-operation in bringing that about.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to co-operate. On the client base, according to the Ned Costello document there is a decision in train to restrict supports to companies with a workforce of greater than ten.  This means that smaller companies will be thrown back on the enterprise boards.  Have the county enterprise boards evolved sufficiently to support the many fine companies which have a workforce of less than ten?  Is that an arbitrary decision?</P>
      <P>With regard to some of the services which the Minister has already closed down in Forbairt, such as the geological research unit, I understand there is only one other company in the country which can provide those kinds of services.  Will companies be faced with a lack of competition in future?  There is competition at present because there is a semi-State geological research unit and there is a private company.  What the Minister is planning to do looks like resulting in a lack of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Why did the Minister not take Shannon Development within the remit of this area?  If there is to be a major industrial development organisation for indigenous industry, why not include the whole country?  Why have a separate agency for the Shannon region?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Development has a wider remit than merely industrial development. With the exception of aviation, its remit is based on internal local organisation within the mid-west region in particular.  Shannon Development has a wider remit which includes tourism.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the document which we published last week.  We want to ensure that Ireland, which is a small country, is appropriately represented overseas and in the main IDA Ireland will look after overseas operations from now on, particularly with regard to food which is currently the responsibility of Forbairt.</P>
      <P>I have not closed down anything.  I am all in favour of competition, but the private sector can provide much of the competition which the Deputy vehemently urged on me a moment ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for the State to be involved in certain areas of activity.  We want a State agency supporting the growth of industry to make sure that Irish companies can be competitive enough to increase their profits, exports, sales and employment.  That is the purpose of what we are doing.  Doing it in this way, by bringing all the expertise together and having a single focus, a one stop shop, is the appropriate way to help the growth and development of industry.  If we learn anything from the IDA Ireland experience since 1993, the fact that that organisation has had a single clear focus has contributed to the outstanding success it has achieved on behalf of this country.  We can have the same level of success with Enterprise Ireland when some of the things which are not appropriate to it are taken elsewhere to more appropriate homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic importance of patents is wideranging and derives from the fact that patentees can exploit their inventions for up to 20 years to the exclusion of all competition.  To assist Irish inventors, Forbairt provides advice on the protection, technical development and commercialisation of inventions under its inventions assistance scheme.  In certain cases Forbairt gives financial assistance with patenting expenses and assists in finding suitable manufacturers.  In giving such assistance Forbairt must satisfy itself that the invention is capable of patent protection, is technically feasible and that there are plans for its commercial exploitation.  Such support to the inventor is conditional on Forbairt sharing in the patent royalty income resulting from the successful exploitation of the invention.</P>
      <P>Forbairt, in considering the degree of State support to give towards the gaining of a patent, must evaluate the inventiveness and technical and commercial merit of the proposal.  Any information submitted to Forbairt towards this process is confidential and used only for the evaluation of the project.  Such information is not in the public domain and does not affect the patent application procedure under the Patents Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the intellectual property area, I am fully aware that inventions should not be in the public domain before application is made to the Patents Office.  I can assure the Deputy that Forbairt is likewise fully conscious of its responsibilities in this area and all Forbairt staff are bound by the confidentiality provisions of the Industrial Development Acts. Disclosure of an invention to Forbairt does not affect the novelty of the invention or prejudice the inventor's right to file a patent application subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Inventors should not have to disclose exact details of their inventions, particularly in the case of a single employee with his own idea. It should be enough to disclose the name of the invention, its functions and advantages.  Regarding the cost factor, a series of expenses has to be incurred before an inventor can secure patent protection.  An application to the Patents Office to register a patent costs £500; a further application for a world-wide search, which has to be done, costs an additional £1,000; and securing global patent rights can cost in excess of £20,000. Could the Minister review the cost factor with regard to registering a patent and examine the possibility of altering the terms of application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made by the Inventors Association of Ireland that an inventor should not have to hand over all information. Forbairt's role is to evaluate projects.  In many cases this could cost up to £20,000, although if things go well Forbairt would gain a percentage of royalties.  Forbairt provides free advice in the initial stages.  It is a valuable third party evaluation <Col N="389" /> agency and it is bound by confidentiality provisions.  In addition, the information is protected under the Freedom of Information Act.  I appreciate that inventors are afraid of handing over all their information, but I am satisfied that the measures in place are satisfactory and I am confident that the staff of Forbairt deal with these issues on that basis.  Comparing costs with those in other countries, there is no difference.  Forbairt has to identify inventions that have potential commercial value and I am satisfied with the procedures that are in place to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister look at the funding of groups of inventors because single inventors with an innovative idea find the system very restrictive?  I do not wish to fault Forbairt, which does outstanding work, but it is often not possible to give the necessary time to an individual in relation to a particular concept.  Some fantastic ideas start from a simple idea, for example, the new instant breakfast cereal.  Ballygowan water is another typical idea.  People who start with small ideas find it very difficult to get through.  Will the Minister look at the question of an innovative policy in the area of inventions geared towards individuals rather than companies?</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with the Inventors Association of Ireland some time ago and they put a number of these points.  I share the Deputy's interest in this area.  I agree it is important to ensure that Forbairt provides the necessary backup for potentially creative people.  I looked carefully at the proposals made by the Inventors Association with regard to making cases <i>en bloc</i>, but there are patent agents to help people who wish to pursue inventions.  The Deputy's proposal with regard to the Inventors Association would not work in practice.  However, they have made important points to me and I am more than willing to look at some of their suggestions.  Equally, if there are individuals who are experiencing problems in getting a proper backup service, I would be more than happy to assist.</P>

      <P>I was very disappointed to hear, earlier this year, that despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland, Microsoft had decided not to relocate its European Internet &ldquo;Mirror Site&rdquo; in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision was taken because of concerns that real competitive conditions and the necessary industry infrastructure did not exist in the Irish telecommunications market.  One important consideration <Col N="390" /> for Internet service providers is the complex software facilities and contractual arrangements which allow individual providers to interrelate and to work together to enhance the overall level of service.  In the case of Microsoft, there was concern that Ireland was not in a position to offer all of the necessary arrangements in this regard.  A key element of any strategy to counter such perceived deficiencies is the attraction of major international players into the market. My Department continues to collaborate closely with all the relevant Government Departments and with the industrial development agencies in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government's recent decisions to sell Cablelink and to end the Telecom Éireann monopoly on voice telephony are important initiatives in the development of Ireland's telecommunications infrastructure.  They will contribute in large part to removing any negative perception of Ireland from a regulatory standpoint as well as to introducing truly competitive conditions into the marketplace. The provision of such competition is necessary if we are to secure the improvements in the quality of service and the lower prices that will in turn enhance Ireland's attraction as a location for future investment by the major international players in the world of electronic commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Department is responsible for this debacle, for the fact that we have lost the opportunity to become a leading location for Internet projects in Europe?  Is the Minister concerned about it?  In her reply she used the words &ldquo;earlier this year&rdquo;, but I understood that the Minister only became aware of the situation earlier this month.  Can we take it that this information was known months ago?  What has been done about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to apportion blame but the fact that we had a derogation from competition in voice telephony was a problem because major global players would not come into the Irish market simply to supply data telecommunications but wanted to be involved in voice telephony also.  The fact that we had a derogation was clearly a problem.  In addition, the decision of the Government to end that and also to sell Cablelink will allow further competition and enhance Ireland as a suitable location for this kind of investment.  The IDA is involved in pursuing many projects.  I became aware of this position well before Easter, in February or March.  The Government has been active on these issues in recent weeks and announcements have been made.  This Government has undertaken more initiatives in the area of telecommunications in a matter of six weeks than were undertaken in the past 75 years.  Those changes are necessary to make Ireland an attractive place and to ensure we have the infrastructure and more global players in the Irish market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I have to accept the company's analysis.  It went to London for this project. I met the company in the past fortnight and I hope we can work with it to get other Microsoft projects into Ireland.  I believe we can do so and the decisions made in recent weeks will help to bring that about.  Ireland has invested enormously in telecommunications since the early 1980s.  We have invested in the region of £2 billion but we have to continue to invest.  It is a rapidly changing sector and we must have the most modern telecommunications system if we are to capture the kind <Col N="392" /> of jobs that are available, particularly those that could be available for peripheral regions.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Stanton.  I am delighted that many of the call centre jobs which depend on telecommunications are going outside the Dublin area.  Not all are going outside Dublin, some will stay in the capital.  However, in so far as we can, we want to encourage the movement of these jobs to the regions.  They provide good opportunities for employment in the regions and the infrastructure can be there if we have the telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that a project of this scale is not attracted to Ireland overnight.  Can the Minister confirm that discussions with Microsoft started a considerable time ago at a time when it was clear that the infrastructure was not available?  What resources did the IDA put into attracting Microsoft at a time when it knew the necessary infrastructure was not available?  Does the Minister think it should have been doing so? The IDA did not suddenly discover that the structures were not available.  When did the IDA start discussions with Microsoft?  Was it wasting its time and giving a false impression that Microsoft was going to come to Ireland if the infrastructure was not available?</P>
      <P>Even though the decision is welcome, did the Government decide to announce the end of the derogation on the deregulation of the telecommunications industry to hide its embarrassment that we lost Microsoft because of that derogation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misunderstanding.  It is not a case of someone going to Telecom Éireann and asking it to bring all the telecommunications to one site.  There are four major hubs in Europe &mdash; Amsterdam, Paris, London and, I think, Stockholm. It is not a question of one player.  Telecom Éireann is linked to Unisource which is one player.  One needs two if not three players on the site.  All of Microsoft's European customers access its home page through Seattle.  As one gets near Seattle it becomes quite congested.  There are several different lines going in.  We need competition. It was not just a question of Telecom Éireann going to a site and installing the telecommunications infrastructure.  Microsoft wanted to make sure that other global players could access the Irish market.  That was not possible until we lifted the telephony derogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have known this for about ten years.  That is why it is regrettable that we did not lift the derogation earlier.  It is regrettable that we had the derogation in the first place.  We have made the right decision to ensure that we capture the kinds of projects that are available.  There is nothing the IDA could have done.  I do not know when discussions began.  It may have been two or three years ago and I can inquire for the Deputy. <Col N="393" /> There are ongoing discussions with all of the major players all of the time.  Microsoft has a major operation at Sandyford.  I am not sure if it has other operations in Ireland.  The IDA holds continuous discussions with companies such as Microsoft to try to get new and additional business. I regret that we lost this project to London where Microsoft has its European headquarters. I hope and believe we will be able to get other projects from Microsoft and other companies. The decisions made on telecommunications will play a large part in bringing that about.</P>

      <P>Denis O'Brien's personal fortune rose by £10 million or £11 million within minutes of the Government announcing the end of the derogation.  Many commentators such as Matt Cooper in last week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> are worried that we had a plan to which we were working.  There may have been an element of media hype surrounding this matter.  How many jobs were involved?  Is the Minister saying that Mr. Alfie Kane was totally misinformed about the bandwidth capacity of his business or that he was lying or spoofing and not being serious about his business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not many jobs were lost because this is a computer which mirrors that at head office.  What is important is the significance of the issue, that other players will join it and that Ireland will be seen as a hub for activity of this kind and will attract new business.  One has to start small.  Only a small number of jobs were involved in the initial stages, perhaps less than 50.</P>
      <P>Forfás recently produced a report on what is needed in telecommunications.  Some of the decisions are being made on foot of that report. The Minister for Public Enterprise has taken that report on board.  It is an excellent report on what is required to ensure that we do not lose our competitive edge.  I am giving the House the facts as they were given to me by the IDA which dealt with this company.  I have also met Microsoft subsequently.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to give details on others.  Two Telecom Éireann representatives spoke on this matter.  Ireland lost the project.  We were in the running for the project and we did not get it.  That is the truth.  If others say otherwise they are wrong.  We lost the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of and share Kieran McGowan's views.  He is happy with the Government's decisions on this matter.  The Deputy is correct.  Any extra costs on industry damage job potential and make companies located here more uncompetitive.  That applies to domestic and foreign companies.  We have had competition with the exception of voice telephony.  It has worked extremely well and substantially reduced international call charges.  We needed to go one step further to introduce competition for voice telephony. We will have that by the end of the year. This will result in two things.  First, competition always reduces charges and brings about change faster than anything else.  Second, it will bring in new major, global players.  They will not come here only to handle data-based telecommunications, they also want to handle voice telephony. Radical decisions have been made in a short space of time and I am delighted they have been so overwhelmingly welcomed by the public.  They will make an enormous difference in providing us with a modern infrastructure to ensure that we capture these projects in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions. Nos. 24, 27, 33, 50, 71 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The commission's report was published on 5 April and concluded that the initial rate should be set at around two thirds of median earnings and should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness.  In the latter respect, the commission left undone considerable work of analysis.</P>
      <P>The Government has established an interdepartmental group of officials to assist it in formulating proposals and a plan of action.  It is particularly important that the minimum wage should be implemented in a manner which minimises any adverse impact on employment.  There is a strong commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce an hourly minimum wage and I fully support its introduction.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group commenced work in April and has been mandated to come back to Government as early as possible.  What is clear is that the initial rate should be established in the context of negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000 which, as the commission pointed out, expires for some in April 2000.  Well before such negotiations I envisage that there will be consultations with the social partners and I have taken the initiative to meet the main organisations in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>In a recent interview on an RTE Sunday radio news programme the Minister indicated that she accepted the recommendation of the commission of a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour.  She is now indicating that the initial rate should be struck in the context of negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.  When should a minimum wage be introduced and at what rate? Does she envisage it will be introduced prior to the year 2000?  The Taoiseach appeared to imply at the IMPACT conference that it would be introduced as early as possible.  Will the unions, including IBEC, be invited to make submissions to the interdepartmental working group?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about £4.40 and the year 2000.  The initial rate should be established in the context of negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.  There are pay agreements which expire in April 2000.  It is important that we do not dismantle any of the national agreements entered into.  Social partnership has served the economy extremely well, it is one of the factors which makes Ireland so attractive for <Col N="396" /> inward investment and which is fuelling the Celtic tiger and high growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>There are sectors where there will be difficulties. We want to introduce a minimum wage in a way that will protect jobs and workers' rights. That is why we have asked an interdepartmental working group to analyse the commission's report and recommend to Government how we can introduce it without putting anyone out of a job. Everybody wants to achieve the same thing. There is a minimum wage under the JLC model for approximately 100,000 workers.  We will be looking for a commitment from all the parties to social partnership that there will be no relativity impact in introducing a minimum wage to ensure there will be no wage inflation.  That is extremely important.</P>
      <P>We are talking about having IBEC involved. When I appointed the commission I spoke to the social partners.  While the representatives on the commission are not the nominees of the social partners, there are two employers, one former trade union official and one teacher as well as the chairperson of the Labour Court.  It is a good balance.  Submissions were received from the social partners with which I have had informal preliminary discussions.  I intend to formalise these in the next few weeks.  There is much concern in some sectors but we can introduce a minimum wage in a way that will protect jobs and vulnerable workers who are being discriminated against in some firms.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the JLC model.  How does she envisage this system working and can it be used as a model in those areas of the economy in which there has never been a minimum wage?  The Minister also mentioned that an interdepartmental working group has been established and that she intends to have discussions with the social partners.  The proposed timeframe, the year 2000, announced unilaterally by the Minister, is the source of considerable disappointment. When will the required legislation be introduced and will the Minister be influenced to any extent by national minimum wage legislation in the United Kingdom?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to introduce the legislation in 1999.  It will be framework legislation and provide for the introduction of a minimum wage.  We will, as recommended by the commission, have to establish a minimum wage commission. Over time the minimum wage will have to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan is disappointed that it is not being introduced immediately.  If it was an easy task, I am sure his party would have introduced it when in Government.  As he is well aware, it is an extremely difficult task and will have implications. We want to ensure it is introduced in a way that will not impact on competitiveness.</P>
      <P>To respond to Deputy Owen, we will not negotiate on the rate.  A rate of £4.40 has been recommended and we will have to assess its impact on other sectors.  In particular, we want a commitment from the social partners &mdash; it was given orally to the commission &mdash; that there will be no relativity impact.  At present values, it will add £800 million per year to the wage bill.  We cannot have a minimum wage and many other things.  We want to introduce it, therefore, in a way that will minimise its impact on the economy and protect jobs and vulnerable workers and at the same time maintain our competitive position.  This is achievable if there is good will all round.  The approach adopted is the best way to proceed.</P>

      <P>I understood there were five questions and I thank the Deputies for tabling them.  Deputies are aware of the response of the TEAM workforce, announced last evening, to the proposals for the transfer of their employment to FLS Aerospace.  The response was 41 per cent which was determined by members replying if they were in favour and not replying if they were not.  I had meetings earlier today with the executive chairman of Aer Lingus and senior management of the Aer Lingus Group and TEAM and I will deal later with those discussions.  I have written to the various unions indicating I would like to meet them and I hope that will happen tomorrow or the day after.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus management has acknowledged for a number of years that TEAM, which has incurred losses totalling £100 million in the period 1991-97, needs a strategic investor to underpin its existence in the third party maintenance industry. That is particularly relevant now since the industry is consolidating in anticipation of the next downturn.</P>
      <P>Last October the chairman of Aer Lingus, Mr. Cahill, proposed that Aer Lingus should seek to identify companies which would be interested in purchasing TEAM outright.  I indicated my agreement, in principle, with this strategy subject to a process of full consultation with staff interests and to my and the Government's consideration of any concrete proposal which might be put to me by the board of Aer Lingus following such a process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1997 Aer Lingus conducted a review of players in the aircraft maintenance industry to identify a range of potential investors in TEAM. Five players initially expressed interest.  Two parties <Col N="399" /> withdrew from the process at an early stage leaving three parties, BF Goodrich, FLS and Allied Signal.  Proposals emerged from BF Goodrich and FLS, but Allied Signal was unable to formulate a proposal.  Management undertook a formal evaluation of the two proposals received using a number of criteria.  Its view was that the FLS proposal was the optimal proposal, particularly since it believed BF Goodrich was not sufficiently committed to TEAM at that time to conclude a deal.</P>
    <P>On 18 December last TEAM signed a letter of understanding with FLS to enter exclusive negotiations to agree the terms of a deal in which FLS would purchase TEAM outright.  At that time I met separately with the unions and Aer Lingus management to discuss the FLS proposal and the staff issues.  I discussed the manner in which consultations would take place between unions, Aer Lingus and the employees.  I also stated in this House the deal would be subject to the agreement of the TEAM workforce.</P>
    <P>I took that position for very good reasons.  As we all know when TEAM was being established in 1990 letters were issued to all staff then transferring from Aer Lingus to TEAM which provided for security of employment within Aer Lingus.  At that time also Aer Lingus management indicated to the TEAM unions that in the event of an external investor being found for TEAM, Aer Lingus would retain at least 51 per cent ownership of TEAM.  Given those undertakings and agreements, I felt any deal which sought to supersede those undertakings could be concluded only with the backing of the workforce.</P>
    <P>In February 1998 an external facilitator, Mr. Gerard Durkan, senior counsel, was appointed to chair discussions between the unions and Aer Lingus.  Those discussions were very detailed and complex ranging over a wide number of issues. Such issues included the letters to which I referred and the 51 per cent ownership issue, but also addressed other important ones such as job security, pay and conditions, pension arrangements, travel concessions etc.</P>
    <P>In this process management made a number of proposals, all subject to the approval of the Aer Lingus board and the shareholder and to an acceptable final offer for TEAM being made by FLS, to address the range of issues involved.  The final proposals, which were presented to the unions at the end of March, would involve payments totalling £54.6 million to employees in return for the resolution of all outstanding staff issues and their agreement to the sale of TEAM to FLS.</P>
    <P>During April further clarifications of the overall offer were teased out.  Finally, earlier this month forms were issued to every member of the 1,540 TEAM workforce on which he or she was invited to indicate acceptance of the offer made and we are all aware of the result that emerged last night.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  The first point is <Col N="400" /> that recriminations would be of no use whatsoever at this juncture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We must deal with the reality we face now.  At all times, my overriding concern was to maximise sustainable employment in TEAM, whether in Aer Lingus ownership or otherwise, and I am on record in this House on several occasions to that effect.</P>
      <P>The business environment within which TEAM is working is extremely competitive and only likely to become more competitive as consolidation in the industry takes effect in the years ahead and the position of smaller independent third party maintenance companies, like TEAM, becomes more difficult.</P>
      <P>I am aware TEAM has made progress in recent years in efficiency terms and in financial performance, but losses were still made in 1997 notwithstanding virtually full order books.  There has been some slippage in the projected financial performance as laid out in TEAM's five year business plan of 1995.  Moreover, TEAM's recent performance has been based on a tight control of costs, including wage costs and a stable industrial relations environment.  If either of those latter two conditions were not to hold, particularly in the current difficult climate surrounding the FLS proposals, then the prospects for TEAM's future viability in the short and long-term under Aer Lingus or any other ownership would be bleak.  I can illustrate this by saying that, according to Aer Lingus management to whom I spoke this afternoon, to concede on the cost base issues raised by staff in the context of the 1990 letters would add about £20 million annually to the TEAM cost base.  Clearly, this would be completely unsustainable and could not be contemplated.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to meetings I had today with the executive chairman and senior management of Aer Lingus and TEAM.  I stressed to them the importance of assessing, in a calm atmosphere, the implications of last night's outcome.  I asked the chairman to submit to me at an early date his assessment of the future direction of TEAM in light of the current circumstances.  I will be conveying essentially the same message to the TEAM unions when I meet their representatives.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that her failure not to support actively or in any way the proposed deal was extremely unhelpful to the board of management and undermined its position in trying to secure a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote?  In view of the bleak prospect she outlined in her reply, will she acknowledge her share of responsibility for the current crisis?  Will she also acknowledge that a plan B has not been put forward by the board, management or the Government to deal with the present situation and there is no indication the Government has any idea how it wishes to proceed? Will the Minister clarify whether the recent <Col N="401" /> resignation of the chief executive, Mr. Gary McCann, resulted from months of disillusionment because of her procrastination and inaction on this and other issues which totally frustrated the management of Aer Lingus?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates has asked many questions and I will address them one by one.  I am politically responsible in Dáil Éireann for all the companies under my remit and I have never sought to say otherwise.  The Deputy asked if there is a plan B. I have just come from a meeting with the chairman and group management.  As of now FLS is still interested and management intends to press ahead by talking to the workforce again.  It intends to spell out to the workforce individually exactly what the situation is.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if the Government had any plan as to how we should proceed.  Immediately on finding out the results of the vote last night I contacted the chairman, who is now the executive chairman, and arranged a group of meetings this afternoon which I have had and more for tomorrow. That is how we intend to proceed.  We had a good productive meeting with them.  They clearly told me they felt there were still issues they could clarify for the greater comfort of members and that they would do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the departure of the chief executive, Gary McGann.  This is a strange story and I have yet to get the facts.  The chairman met me last Tuesday morning and told me the chief executive was resigning.  It was a difficult occasion.  I could not quite understand why it has happening on that day.  He asked me to bring the matter to Cabinet, which I did.  While the Cabinet was meeting the press release was issued by Aer Lingus.  Conflicting reports have since emerged.  I thank Mr. McGann who gave excellent service to the State during this time with Aer Lingus and I have written to him to that affect.  I had excellent relations with him, but it is difficult for somebody to refuse an offer of £200,000 more than they are earning.</P>

      <P>Given that the letter of guarantee on which yesterday's vote was based was endorsed by Deputy Brennan when he was Minister, does the Minister accept that her handling of the situation has misled the workforce in TEAM Aer Lingus?  Will she clarify what the letter of guarantee means?  Does it mean, as many TEAM workers believe, that no matter what happens the company, individual workers will have a job for life with Aer Lingus?  Alternatively, does it mean that if the worst comes to the worst and TEAM goes to the wall, individual TEAM <Col N="402" /> workers will only be entitled to two letters of dismissal, one from TEAM transferring them to Aer Lingus and another from Aer Lingus with the redundancy notice, saying that because there is no maintenance work in Aer Lingus they have no job?

      <P>There are three letters of guarantee, but for the purposes of the debate it is sufficient to refer to one, dated 29 June 1990, which encapsulates the others.  It states:</P>
      <P>I refer to the establishment of TEAM Aer Lingus and the question of your present Aer Lingus status, working conditions and privileges. The purpose of this letter is to advise you on a personal basis [the letter was addressed individually] that while you will be required to work within TEAM you will, however, remain a member of Aer Lingus staff and will retire as a member of Aer Lingus staff, retaining full Aer Lingus retiree conditions.  Your rights, privileges and seniority as a staff member of Aer Lingus will be continued on the same basis as applied to all other Aer Lingus staff.  Your present seniority will also accumulate within TEAM.  If promoted in the future within TEAM you will not be required to resign from Aer Lingus and you will still retain the guarantees within this letter.

      <P>The Deputy also asked about having a job for life.  I do not think anybody has a job for life.  That is the rhetoric of some years ago.

Will she admit, in view of the workers' rejection of the proposal, that FLS is totally unsuited to taking over TEAM?  It has less aviation <Col N="403" /> experience, has incurred financial losses and has a history of redundancies.  How can the Minister justify allowing between 2,000 and 4,000 workers in direct and indirect employment, to be handed over to the tender mercies of a multinational with no guarantee for their future employment?  Will she take steps in the context of TEAM and other publicly owned companies to ensure that people appointed to sensitive and responsible positions of management and with big incomes are pledged to the ideals and practice of public ownership and do not look over the fence to big corporations for the best offer they can get?</P>

      <P>There are many employees in TEAM who have great creative ability and who have worked hard for the company.  I have no reason to doubt this.  The Deputy spoke about the Minister ensuring that those appointed to managerial positions are committed to publicly owned companies and pledged to the ideals of public ownership.  I respect the Deputy's views, but because of the clear need for competitiveness in all industries within Europe, a guarantee cannot be given to a public company that it will forever remain a public company.  I say this, as I prefer to be straightforward.</P>
      <P>Our manifesto included a promise to look at companies on an individual basis to examine their needs and future direction.  Increasingly, if they want to participate in the marketplace they must be competitive and open to partnership and new ideas.

Given the overwhelming majority of staff rejected the proposed sell-off of 100 per cent of the company, does the Minister accept it was a mistake on her part to instruct management to sell off TEAM? Will she now instruct management to examine other options in place of the 100 per cent sell-off, including employee shareholding, an outside joint venture with a private company and continued Aer Lingus participation in the company?  Will she also agree that it is incomprehensible for Aer Lingus and the Minister to seek to sell its own maintenance company when its maintenance bill is set to increase from £25 million to £65 million?</P>

The management and chairman of TEAM today indicated that, as of now, FLS is still interested.  The chairman is due to meet representatives of FLS in the morning.

I reminded the <Col N="405" /> chairman of the agreed 49 per cent figure and asked whether management would consider that course of action.

If the day comes when such a worker is transferred back to Aer Lingus, will the letter of guarantee prevent Aer Lingus from making such a worker redundant?  That point must be clarified as it is one which has given rise to much difficulty.

      <P>I am unable to provide the clarity which the Deputy seeks.  I expressed my non-legal opinion that it appears to me the letter is a strong endorsement that an individual TEAM employee is an Aer Lingus employee.  Over the years since 1993 and 1994, a series of voluntary redundancies have taken place in Aer Lingus and we are all aware of the difficulties which existed there.  However, there were no compulsory <Col N="406" /> redundancies at any stage.  I understand that if a TEAM worker reverts to being an Aer Lingus employee, there would be a clear onus on the company to adhere to the manner in which it has operated heretofore, namely through the provision of voluntary redundancies.  The letter is quite clear in its statement that a TEAM worker will continue to enjoy guarantees and rights as a staff member of Aer Lingus on the same basis as all other Aer Lingus staff.  However, that does not seem to me to be a blank cheque for a job for life.  The reality is that such jobs are simply no longer available.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 7, after &ldquo;under&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subsection (3) of this section, section 11,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on one I have tabled to section 11.  It has to do with the reference to regulations or orders made under the Act. I will propose later on that we take a different view of section 11 of this Bill.  It is my contention that orders to be made under that section should not be of the passive kind envisaged here but, rather, should be of an active kind that would require the specific agreement of the Houses. That is a better procedure for orders of the importance of those that are contemplated here. Will the Minister accept this?  We had some discussion on this matter on Committee Stage when the Minister seemed to be disposed to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes has again tabled an amendment which he originally proposed on Committee Stage.  The amendment would remove the scope of section 2(5) with regard to regulations made under two sections. The first one would be regulations under section <Col N="420" /> 2(3) which the Minister is empowered to make in respect of removing difficulties in bringing any provision of the Bill into operation.</P>
      <P>The second concerns regulations under section 11.  It is more appropriate to discuss section 11 separately because there are a number of amendments to it.  Section 11 does not refer to the making of any orders or regulations. Presumably, the Deputy is referring to section 2 of the Local Authority Officers and Employees Act, 1926, under which the Minister may, with the concurrence of the Local Appointments Commission, specify which posts are to be filled by the LAC.</P>
      <P>The amendment as drafted would mean that regulations under section 2(3) would not have to be laid before the Oireachtas.  I do not think that is the Deputy's intent but that would be the effect of that amendment.</P>
      <P>Last week, during the debate on the Deputy's amendment at the select committee, I explained that the effect of that amendment would be to remove altogether the requirement for certain regulations to be laid before the House at any stage.  Given the fact that, I understand, the Deputy wants them to be laid before the House, and the Deputy himself accepted at that stage that his wording was a bit wayward, I am puzzled as to why the amendment should have been tabled again in the same format.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason for putting down the amendment was that the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he might reconsider this matter.  It seems to me that the form of the amendment is irrelevant.  The Minister went through all that last week and we have had the benefit of his wisdom.  However, I would like to ask him now if he has thought again about the discussion we had on the form of orders to be made and the circumstances in which orders would be made.  Does he have any new thinking to tell us about at this stage?  I note from the amendments tabled that the Minister is not proposing any amendment.  Maybe when we get to section 11 the Minister might think again about it.</P>

      <P>I am sure.  On the regulations under section 11, a number of points were made which I have considered.  The Deputy has accepted that I have tabled a number of amendments in light of the previous discussion.  It would be more proper to discuss them at that stage.</P>
      <P>Requiring each and every order that may be made under section 11 to be subject to an affirming resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas does not make sense.  For example, if the Department was to create a new type of post in the local authority service, or if the title of an existing post was to be changed, then I as Minister would have to make the necessary order to specify that the posts are to be filled by the LAC. It would be a waste of national parliamentary time to stipulate that an order would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas by way of positive resolution so that the LAC could hold a competition for what, in many cases, may be a single post.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy made some valid points on Committee Stage about the wider issue of whether we should have positive or negative motions on orders, I am satisfied that in this case the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be involved in what is a minor housekeeping matter. I am also satisfied that the requirement that will be included in section 11, if it is passed by the House, to inform the Oireachtas of decisions on section 11 &mdash; using the mechanism of posting the orders after the event, which can subsequently be annulled &mdash; is appropriate.  It will provide sufficient safeguards to allay any fears Deputies might have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3<i>a:</i></P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 41 to 45 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may as respects an amount of moneys paid by him or her out of the Fund under subsection (1) require the local authority or local authorities concerned to apply the amount or a part thereof in a specified manner in respect of the performance by that local authority or those local authorities of its or their functions in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)public roads, other than national roads within the meaning of the Roads Act, 1993,</P>
      <P>(b) the carrying out of works under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, or</P>
      <P>(c) such other matters as the Minister may, from time to time, determine in writing, and the local authority or local authorities shall comply with such a requirement.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a copy of any determination under subsection (2)(c) as soon as may be after the determination is made.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises because of concerns expressed by Deputy Dukes that the subsection, as initially drafted, represented a threat to local discretion, would lead to increased centralisation and would open the door for ministerial interference in the affairs of individual local authorities. The Deputy was gracious to accept my word that that was not my intention.  He made the point on Committee Stage that we are all birds of passage in this House and that others will come after us.  I reiterate that I have no intention of legislating for increased centralisation in local authority operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has accepted the thrust of these legislative proposals to provide local authorities with more money now and in the future to enable them to perform their functions better and to enhance local autonomy and discretion by at least providing them with resources which will give them real choices when making decisions on spending and priorities.  I agreed to look again at the subsection to see if I could meet the point the Deputy made and try to improve it.  This amendment will make the intentions behind the subsection clearer than they were before.  I hope it mitigates the concerns expressed by Deputy Dukes and others on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this issue it is important to realise that the new local government fund will be different from the equalisation fund which was established under the current funding system.  Not only will it be used to contribute towards the general purposes already set out in the previous Bill, <Col N="423" /> but it will also be used to fund the non-national roads programme.  The primary purpose of section 6(2) is to facilitate the Minister to direct moneys to that non-national roads programme. Motor tax will go into the general fund and the Minister must have power to direct that.  Subsection (2)(c), which refers to the &ldquo;carrying out of works under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968,&rdquo; is related to that in that it covers local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>During discussions on the subsection on Committee Stage I indicated that the local government fund might be used to finance measures designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local authority operations or to finance initiatives aimed at improving the quality of services provided by them.  The nature of such measures and initiatives will differ from one local authority to another.  A degree of flexibility is needed, therefore, if the fund is to operate to best effect.  For that reason, I propose in subsection (2)(c) that the Minister may, from time to time, determine in writing other matters in respect of which local authorities may be required to use moneys allocated from the fund.  The flexibility which that paragraph facilitates will be necessary to cater for situations where the fund is adjusted in future years in accordance with section 4(3) and (4).</P>
    <P>It is envisaged, as part of the ringfencing and financing of local government, that if a new function is imposed on a local authority, money will have to be provided by the Exchequer and paid into the local government fund.  I or any future Minister would need, at least initially, the power to direct a local authority to pay that money out of the fund for a particular purpose.  I said on Committee Stage that £300,000 is being put into the fund, in addition to the £270 million for the architectural heritage package we announced. The Minister must be in a position to direct that the £300,000 be used for that purpose.  It will then be subsumed into the general expenditure of the local authority.  For that reason there must be a mechanism whereby if extra funding is provided for specific purposes, such as happened in relation to the Abattoirs Act, 1988, the Minister can specify that when making payments out of the fund.  I am trying to balance that with the Deputy's point about the dangers of centralisation and a Minister totally strangling local government, a scenario from which Members on all sides of the House said they want to move away.</P>
    <P>I hope this amendment meets the Deputy's concerns.  It may not be able to meet his suggestions on Committee Stage to the letter but it should meet their spirit.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for giving some further specifications.  The amendment goes as far as it is possible to go within the overall limits and constraints of the present funding system. <Col N="424" /> It is useful that the Minister has taken the opportunity to be more specific about certain uses to which funds could be put.  I appreciate his point about the £300,000 and the need for the Minister to be able to direct that funding to be used for specific purposes.  I would like to see a more open position in relation to local authority funding but within the context of the legislation. We cannot look at this legislation outside that context.  The Minister has gone quite a distance and as far as is reasonably possible to meet the types of concerns I and other Members expressed last week on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In the general interests of public information and for the information of Members of this House, the provision the Minister has included in the new subsection (3) of this amendment is useful. I am not prepared to bet that copies of the determinations made under this subsection will be the most read documents in the House, but at least the information will be available for those who have an interest in it.  That is a substantial advance on the present situation.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for having gone so far as to meet the spirit of what was discussed on Committee Stage.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: This amendment gives the Minister the power to direct local authorities to use moneys out of the fund.  Why did he confine the use of such moneys to roads?  I regret that the Minister did not include local authority housing.  Why has he ignored the current dreadful crisis in local authority housing?

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I was illustrating the background to the point.  Last year 85 homes were provided while there was a waiting list for 1,500.  The previous Government had a similar record.  Will the Minister think again about committing substantial funds, in addition to the £270 million provided in this Bill, to an emergency programme to end the housing crisis and the suffering for those on local authority housing lists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Bill specified roads and drainage is simply because part of the local government fund is made up from motor tax and, as I explained to Deputy Dukes, the Minister wants to retain a power.  It is necessary to retain the power to specify that the money should be spent on roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Higgins's point about the alleged housing crisis, to which he continually refers, it is easy to talk about and to talk up a housing crisis. Members on all sides are aware of the plight of <Col N="425" /> those on local authority housing lists.  Particularly during the past four or five years successive Governments have stepped up the output under social housing and endeavoured to meet the problems of those living in conditions which are not acceptable in a civilised society.  The use of words such as &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; etc., is over the top.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: It is not.  I hear it at my clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have clinics and quite a number of people come to me about housing issues and their desire to get a local authority house.  The Deputy has quoted 3,900 houses as the sum total of this Government's or the previous Government's efforts at tackling the social housing problem while there are 27,000 on the local authority housing waiting list and said it would be 20 or 30 years before the housing list is cleared.  In the real world we all know the housing list will never be cleared.  There will always be a need for social housing.  As people are housed off the social housing list, others will come on it.  I will not insult the Deputy by saying he is not aware of the problem but he is trying to ignore the fact that since 1990 or 1991 successive Governments have undertaken an extensive social housing policy where almost 10,000 people are taken off the housing list each year under the various initiatives.  These include almost 4,000 houses built by local authorities.  There is huge support for voluntary and co-operative housing and various improvements have been made in that area.  Taxpayers' money is used to pay for these initiatives.  Last year £214 million was provided by the Government to local authorities, they were notified of their allocations early in January, six weeks earlier than usual.  That £214 million included an increase of £34 million or 19 per cent on that provided previously.  That is an example of the commitment of this Government and of the previous Governments given that the allocation increased substantially since the early 1990s.  There are financial allocations in the housing programme for remedial works, improvement works in lieu, sites and extension schemes and co-operative housing.  This is a side issue in that it is not directly related to this section but it is one I could not leave unanswered.  Housing is not dealt with specifically in this Bill.  The reason roads are included is that the fund includes motor tax money.  Local authorities are being given direct control over the spending of that money on non-national roads.  For that reason it is a good Bill.</P>

It has come to my attention that the concessionary grants which were available to the area administrators of health boards has ceased.  Those who have to apply for the DPG grants can receive only two thirds of that grant from the county council.  In many cases, because this concessionary grant has ceased, they cannot give evidence <Col N="426" /> that they have the financial facility to pay the extra one third and are suffering as a result.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 20 to 24 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may establish a committee to advise the Minister with respect to the performance by him or her of the functions under subsection (1) or (3) and a committee so established may advise the Minister accordingly.</P>
      <P>(7) Such a committee shall include such and so many officers or members of local authorities as the Minister shall determine for the purposes of this subsection, and may also include such other persons as the Minister determines for that purpose and whom he or she considers otherwise possess qualifications or experience that make them suitable for appointment as such members.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose out of Committee Stage. Deputy Dukes spoke on this topic.  I indicated to him I saw some merit in the amendment he proposed which would extend the scope of the committee to enable it to advise the Minister with regard to the performance of functions conferred on the Minister by section 6(3).  Those particular <Col N="427" /> functions include steps which might be taken to promote improvement in the quality of local authority services or to encourage economy, efficiency and effective performance by local authorities.  On Committee Stage I indicated to the Deputy that his proposed amendment might be a little inflexible in that it would mean the Minister of the day would have to deal with subsections (1) and (3) but might wish the committee to advise on either one or the other.  I fully acknowledge the amendment put down by Deputy Dukes but I am advised by the parliamentary draftsman that this is a better way to proceed.  It encompasses fully what Deputy Dukes intended but also introduces an element of flexibility into the potential operation of the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 6(6), as drafted, provides that a committee established under this section may include officers or members of local authorities.  During the debate on Committee Stage, Deputies Dukes and Howlin were of the view that we needed to strengthen that section to read &ldquo;shall&rdquo; include officers or members of local authorities.  I indicated my willingness to examine that and consider bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to cater for it.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the committee established under section 6, Deputy Howlin raised on Committee Stage the question of providing for possible inclusion in such a committee members whom the Minister considers possess qualifications or experience that would make them suitable for appointment as such members.  That was already provided for in the 1997 Bill in relation to the local government equalisation council.  Again I indicated I would be amenable to taking on board that suggestion and the amendment I propose does that.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 6(6) reflect the consensus reached in the select committee as regards the committee which can be established to advise Ministers, and on that basis I recommend them to the House.  I acknowledge the contributions made by the Deputies on Committee Stage to improving this section.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 1 to 32.</P>
      <P>I will address all the issues for the sake of rationality. I am strenuously opposed to the Government's proposal in the Bill to defer local government elections for a further year.  This is a crucial part of the Bill and I regard it as a further attack on local democracy after postponements by a previous Government.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage there was an outbreak of righteous aspirations in regard to this issue from the spokespersons for the main political parties. Various arguments were made, with which I agree, that it was not in the interest of local government or local democracy and that it should not happen again.  Unfortunately, as far as the Minister is concerned, that will not be the case this time.  The other parties were not very forthcoming in pressing the Government to ensure there were no more postponements of local elections. Young Augustines all, virtuous, but not yet.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted, eight years will have passed since the previous elections by the time the local government elections are held.  Any dictatorship would consider itself lucky to get such a stretch without being overturned or subjected to scrutiny by the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Currently there is a serious deficit in regard to local democracy because of these postponements. The Minister must know from his own experience that in some county councils, up to 20 per cent and perhaps even 25 per cent of the membership elected in 1991 has been changed without any reference to the people by the process of resignation, the death of councillors and so on.  A significant number of councils, therefore, have been appointed merely by way of a vote in the council or an arrangement between parties without reference to the people.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, local communities are being disenfranchised by these ongoing postponements. At the same time, with councils now having gone beyond their original mandate time, serious decisions are being taken that affect communities within the administrative areas of local authorities. These include strategies in regard to waste disposal and landfill sites as well as rezonings of crucial areas of land.  These decisions are being made in an ongoing way by these councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the new development plans of local authorities should not be finally voted on and a decision made until after the next local elections, whenever they might be.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this <Col N="429" /> amendment in the interest of local communities, good planning and local democracy.  Everyone knows the development plans have major implications for existing communities in regard to the way in which their environment will be developed in future.  As soon as development decisions have been put into effect, they cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, the Minister's predecessor and a member of Fianna Fáil, referring to planning in Dublin county and particularly to a spate of rezonings, said that in the Dublin context these rezonings were a debased currency.  He was correct in that outrageous decisions were made.  Fortunately, other outrageous proposals collapsed by virtue of opposition from communities and councillors representing those communities.  There was a wholesale ignoring of the wishes of local communities by a rezoning coalition of councillors from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, with some exceptions in each of those parties &mdash; who consistently stood out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that in addition to addressing his remarks to amendment No. 6, he should also speak to amendments Nos. 7 and 8 because he can only formally move those amendments when we reach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I am now speaking to amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>The democratic wish of communities was ignored.  There was an infamous case in Laraghcon on the slopes of the Liffey Valley beside Lucan where in a subsequent local referendum thousands of people deplored and voted against luxury houses being built on a crucial green break between two massively built up communities, greater Blanchardstown and Lucan.  A tiny handful voted in favour of that and yet the councillors put that through, understanding that such opposition existed.</P>
      <P>My point in amendment No. 7 is that councils going into their eighth year in some cases are considering new development plans.  That is the case in Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and possibly many more councils.  Those are obviously two important areas.  Going into their eighth year with 20 or 25 per cent of the members not elected by the people, they are intending to make crucial decisions on this development plan which will involve undemocratic large-scale further rezonings of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is trying to encourage a major shake out of members of the councils in the next election and he has provisions in this Bill to that end.  It probably means that many more councillors do not intend to stand again in the upcoming local elections.  How receptive will they be to the pleadings to their communities and their electorate given that they do not intend to stand again?  Many of them will be even less receptive than they were at the earlier stage of the life of these councils in 1993 and 1994.  The real threat is that the rezoning juggernaut, that is Fianna <Col N="430" /> Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, will once again roll over areas of greenery which should be preserved as a breathing lung for the people of greater Dublin.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that the current obscene price of houses is because of a shortage of zoned land. That is a myth.  The South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council have stated clearly in their preliminary to the development plans that there is enough land zoned for years to come for housing, so that is not an argument.</P>
    <P>To have development plans which can command real public support and the maximum input of the local communities and people whose lives they will affect the most democratic way to approach it would be to have discussion of the proposals for the development plan, for rezonings or for other issues relating to development.  They should be debated in the run up to the next local elections as part of the election campaign.  No decision should be taken until after the local elections. Therefore, the communities will have the opportunity of voting for their development plans in an informed manner because they will have the opportunity of hearing from the candidates from all parties and their views on development, rezonings, the preservation of green belts and other crucial issues much wider than that which the development plan takes into account.</P>
    <P>In that way, the communities would be guaranteed the election to the councils of those who really represent their wishes and, therefore, would get a development plan which sets the scene for decades to come which reflects the democratic wishes of the community.  Although the Minister was not inclined to take on board this point on Committee Stage, I ask him to do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was debated on Committee Stage.  Although there is a great deal of room for argument in what Deputy Higgins stated and, whatever else he does, he never short changes the House on his tirades, it is a basic nonsense for the Deputy to propose that development plans should be held up because the lives of councils have been extended and there are people who are now members of those councils who were not elected but who have been co-opted according to the provisions in law.  It would be a nonsense to propose that any elected body, because it is coming towards the end of its life, whether or not that life has been extended, should refuse or be deprived of the opportunity to exercise part of its functions.  I do not see any reason that should be the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is proposing, for example, that a Government which is coming within a few months of a general election should not make significant decisions.  He is proposing that no local authority, even if it lasts no longer than the statutory lifetime&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is proposing that no local authority which has had the misfortune of having several members die during its normal period of office to be replaced by people co-opted according to the law should make substantial decisions.  That is nonsense.</P>
      <P>This amendment flies in the face of every provision in the Constitution and in law relating to the notion of the continuity of responsibility of elected bodies for the functions which they are given.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Higgins has arguments to make about rezonings although I feel that he ought to read the Bacon report again.  It is not the case that that report confirms that there is enough land zoned for years to come around Dublin.  That kind of simplistic toe-thumping will not solve the housing problem anymore than the action which has been taken will solve the problem of house prices.</P>
      <P>These amendments are without merit.  To propose that we, in this House, should deprive local authorities because of accidents of time and history of the exercise of their proper functions is bizarre and cannot come from any real effective concern with democracy but from some rather bent notion of a form of democracy which got its answer in Mexico a good many years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, amendment No. 6<i>a</i>, is part of this group.</P>
      <P>To reiterate what I stated on Committee Stage, I agree with the basic premise which Deputy Higgins has put forward in relation to the postponement of local elections.  It is not a pious aspiration.  I said on Committee Stage that I intended to put a constitutional guarantee for local government before the electorate and to try to ensure as a result that local elections will not be postponed in the future.  I can only deal with the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also stated on Committee Stage that there are any number of justifications for postponing the local government elections in this case for one year, irrespective of what might have happened during the lifetime of previous Governments and the motivations, political or otherwise, for the postponement of local elections.  Deputy Higgins spoke about democracy and doing things properly. The reasons I gave for postponing the local government elections, and they are reasons, not excuses, were that we have a major programme of local government renewal spanning a number of years now under way which started some time back.  The funding arrangements in this Bill are part of it, and the establishment of SPCs are another part of it.  Over the next 12 months I hope to signal further elements of the programme, including a fairly detailed local government reform Bill that will radically alter local government as we know it.  In that context it is only right that those who intend to stand for local election should know exactly the format of the local government system in which they intend to stand <Col N="432" /> for election, and the electorate should know exactly the type of system we will have and the changes that will be put in place so that they can make the choice as to the type of person they want to see on their local authority.  Nothing could be more democratic than that.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised by Members, and I am sure by the Deputy, that there is need for new blood in the system, but new blood, whether young people, women or representatives of other sectors of the community, will not come into the system just because we encourage people who have been in the system for a long time to leave it, as proposed in a later section of the Bill.  There has to be a system that will attract people and convey clearly to them that by standing for local government they will be able to make a meaningful contribution to their local community.  The postponement of local elections will facilitate that.  It would be wrong to have elections this year and then to attempt to change utterly the local government system.  That would be unfair to people who contested the elections under the current system.</P>
    <P>I also made the point on Committee Stage that currently the electoral areas with which we are dealing were drawn up in 1985 and that there are various discrepancies.  The boundary commissions will deal with at least one of those discrepancies in population within each of the local authority areas.  There might be a need to go further, but certainly within local authority areas the review of the local electoral areas should be in place and clear to everybody before the next local elections. That would not have been possible within the timescale we envisage.  For those reasons democracy in this case is better served by waiting rather than by having an election this year and having major upheaval in the following years in reforming the local government system.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Higgins in relation to development plans.  He is doing no service to the development planning process or to the process generally by trying to link the development plan to local elections.  A development plan is meant to be a plan for the entire county or borough area.  It is not a plan under which each community will have a veto on everything that happens in its own area.  That is what the Deputy is proposing by suggesting that we should have an election campaign based on the development plan.  If we were to go down that route there would be a mishmash of development or a total lack of development or forward planning. The development planning process is wide open to public participation.  I strongly believe that people should participate in it.  I intend, in the legislation currently being drafted in the Department, to ensure that they will have a greater say &mdash; not post the draft development plan period &mdash; but prior to it.  Local communities should be consulted on that, but it would not be in the interests of the public, the local authorities or the counties in general to postpone work on county development plans so that people can <Col N="433" /> stand for election on the basis of whether they oppose particular developments.  I made the point on Committee Stage that the very fact that a considerable number of people will face the electorate next June is probably one very good way of concentrating their minds to make sure they make good planning and development decisions over the coming months.  Policy that involves people continually saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; is not good planning policy.  We have to ensure that we have sustainable development and good planning, not a situation where people have a veto.  The proposal Deputy Higgins put forward in his amendments would lead to that. Deputy Dukes has eloquently argued that we would all be totally tied up and unable to make decisions in the last six to 12 months of our terms of office if we accepted the principle outlined in these amendments.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.  If we accepted the principle in these amendments we would end up with lame duck administrations.</P>

We have had too much of people not stating their real views and flying in the face of communities when elected.  Local communities are disenfranchised and people are angry when county councils go into their eighth year.  They will be angered at many of the decisions made in the development plan without reference to them after almost eight years.</P>

      <P>11.  &mdash; Where immediately prior to the passing of this Act a person held a temporary appointment to perform the functions of an office or employment to which section 2(1)(b) of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, would have applied but for the temporary nature of the appointment, the appointment, during the two years commencing on such passing, of that person to the office or employment, being an office or employment up to and including the grade of Executive Engineer and cognate grades, on a permanent basis shall not be deemed to be an appointment to an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have had numerous representations on this section which has caused major concern among many associations and unions.  The Irish Planning Institute and SIPTU are among the organisations which have contacted me.  They feel that appointments should not be removed from the LAC as this would remove some of the seriousness of the situation concerning these appointments.  If this was brought to a local level there would be major problems concerning appointments to posts such as executive engineers.  The Minister should accept this amendment as it would overcome the problem of people such as engineers being on temporary contracts with local authorities and UDCs.  On Committee Stage the Minister stated that temporary employment was one of the problems he had with the LAC and was resulting in an overload of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much debate on section 11 in the select committee.  My amendment addresses these issues.  Much of the concern expressed to Deputy Wall and other Members on this section is misplaced and based on a misunderstanding. However, the concern exists and I accept the Deputy's comments.  When examining section 11 on Committee Stage, Deputies Dukes and Howlin tabled amendments which have now been re-entered.  Their concerns were to incorporate changes in the Bill which I said at the time were unnecessary and inappropriate in primary legislation.  I made it clear and reiterate that it was my intention to have the Local Appointments Commission continue to fill all the senior <Col N="436" /> technical and administrative posts in local authorities at and above the level of county secretary and senior executive engineer.  This is roughly the equivalent of assistant principal officer in the Civil Service.  I undertook to re-examine the matter in light of the views expressed in the select committee.</P>
      <P>I am now proposing to amend the original section of the Bill to provide a statutory basis for specifying posts in local authorities which are to be filled by the Local Appointment Commission. The new subsection (1)(a) provides that in future the Minister will declare by order the posts which are to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission, that is all the posts which are subject to the general provisions of the 1926 Act referred to in Select Committee.  Every order made by the Minister must be made with the concurrence of the local appointments commissioners.  They have to be consulted in every case.  Paragraph (c) requires every order made to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  An order may be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is a consequential provision discontinuing the application of section 4 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) (Amendment) Act, 1926, which empowers the Minister to revoke, wholly or in part, declarations of offices to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment which meets the Deputies' concerns is to remove the absolute statutory requirement that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.  It is an archaic provision which has long outlived its usefulness.  It imposes on the commission an undue burden in filling lower level technical posts at salary levels equivalent to or below the level of HEO in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about devolving powers to the local authorities and giving them more responsibility.  In this instance we are giving them the power to appoint their own staff below a certain level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to members.  I received a submission from the Institute of Planners to which Deputy Wall referred and it appeared to be of the opinion that local authority members would make the decisions as to who would be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provision puts posts for which a professional <Col N="437" /> qualification is required on a par with administrative posts.  The Minister will make a statutory order specifying the posts that will continue to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.  It is my intention that the commission will continue to fill all senior technical and administrative posts at and above the level of county secretary and senior executive engineer. The equivalent post in the Civil Service is assistant principal.  We must be amenable to changing circumstances.  It would be inappropriate to lock ourselves into a system where restructuring and the regrading of posts in the local authorities could not take place without amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to what the Deputies have had to say.  It was the fear of what might happen rather than the contents of the Bill which caused outside bodies to express concerns.  The approach I have adopted for making statutory orders is the correct one.  Every order made will be laid before the House.  The first set of orders I make will reflect the commitment I have given in relation to the posts that will continue to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I will not rehash the arguments I made about the number of posts that remain to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission but let me give one statistic.  There are 650 applicants for the two executive engineer positions currently being filled by the commission.  The system is clogged up.  For that reason I commend the amendment in my name to the House.  It incorporates the spirit, if not the letter, of the amendments tabled by the Deputies.  I have gone as far as I can to meet their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled as to the order in which the amendments are being taken.  I am not criticising anybody but seeking information.  I am always thirsty for new knowledge and information. I am puzzled as to how amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Wall which deals with one corner of the problem we are discussing should take precedence over amendment No. 10 in my name which is of a more general nature. As it deals with a wider issue, amendment No. 10 should be taken first.  There is probably a very good reason they are being taken in this way but it has not been revealed to me.  Clearly, amendment No. 9<i>a</i> in the name of the Minister takes precedence over amendment No. 10 as it is an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I perked up a little when it appeared the Minister was about to say that, on reflection, he would accept amendment No. 10 but he then outlined the good reasons for including the provisions set out in amendment No. 9<i>a.</i>  I do not intend to deal with this matter at great length except to say that I accept the Minister aims to deal with the problems which have been highlighted.  Has he given any consideration to an issue raised during the course of the discussion on Committee Stage, that is, whether provision should be made for an oversight <Col N="438" /> or monitoring by the Local Appointments Commission of the exercise of the managerial or executive function in making appointments and organising competitions and so on?  The Minister told us on Committee Stage he was happy that the operation, implementation and execution of local competitions had been carried out in a proper way, but there are occasions when, with or without justification, people feel that may not always be the case.  For that reason since we have an LAC, which is about to be relieved of some of its burden by the provisions of this Bill, will the Minister reconsider making some provision for oversight, monitoring or some involvement by the LAC in the organisation of those competitions to ensure all those who have an interest in such competitions can be content they are being carried out strictly according to the rubric?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments. I have given some thought to his question about the oversight of the managerial function in regard to implementing the new powers, but I have not come up with a solution.  I am amenable to his suggestion provided it does not need to be written into legislation.  There is a possibility somebody appointed by the LAC could monitor a number of appointments that might be made under the new system, even on a spot check basis. I will reconsider the matter and revert to him on it.  There may be value in what he said, particularly when we are changing to a revised system. All Members are committed to devolving power to local authorities to allow them deal with their own business.  We want them to take responsibility for their functions and this legislation will allow them to do that.  It is normally the function of the Department to ensure local authorities carry out their functions properly in the broadest sense and in that context there may be a role for the Local Appointments Commission.  I will examine the matter to see if we can devise some system to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point and I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me on it.  Some of these changes are designed to bring new blood into local authorities.  There is concern among councillors that under this legislation, unless there are changes to it, those who decide to run for election and are defeated will be treated differently from those who are made redundant by the Minister rather than by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Many councillors have raised this question.  The Minister is aware of their concern and submissions were made by local authorities and their associations.  Councillors who are a member of more than one local authority can be compensated only in respect of one authority. What would the position be if a councillor decided to run for one local authority and retire from the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the amendments carefully he would note the answers are contained in them.  I am not proposing to make any councillor redundant, but members of local authorities, who have a minimum of five years' service, will have the option of deciding in a period, probably between June and 1 September 1998, whether they want to declare they are not standing for election again.  If they make such a declaration, they will be given a certificate to show they are entitled to a gratuity in recognition of their service to their local community through the local government system.  All local authority members will have that opportunity but if councillors do not avail of it, run for election and are defeated, their years of service will go unrecognised. I do not believe I can be accused of equivocation on this matter and I know the Deputy was not implying that.  Councillors cannot have a two way bet on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputy's second point, that provision is intended to recognise service to local government. If councillors are a member of an urban council, a borough corporation, a corporation or a town commissioner and a county council they <Col N="440" /> will have to resign from local government.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The purpose of the Bill is to repeal section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976, which provides that all natural gas landed in the State or got within the jurisdiction of the State for consumption therein shall be offered for sale to Bord Gais Éireann on reasonable terms.  The section also provides that any gas which is so offered to and purchased by BGE shall be disposed of by the board for consumption in the State unless the Minister for Public Enterprise gives consent for the export of the gas.</P>
      <P>The need for the Bill arises from advice received from the Attorney General that section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976, is anti-competitive and in conflict with the competition provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty which Ireland signed in December 1994.  In order to ratify this treaty, all contracting parties to it must ensure their domestic laws and regulations are compatible with its provisions.  Section 37 would have to be repealed in any case to bring the Act into line with national and EU competition rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I will outline the background.  In 1971 Marathon International Petroleum Ireland Limited announced the discovery of deposits of natural gas off Kinsale Head which in 1973 were declared to be commercially exploitable.  Following this first discovery of indigenous natural gas <Col N="441" /> reserves, the Gas Act, 1976, was enacted to establish Bord Gais Éireann as the statutory body with responsibility to purchase, transmit, distribute, sell and supply natural gas.</P>
    <P>When the Kinsale Head gas field was discovered by Marathon it was a time of great volatility in the energy market.  The advent of natural gas to our energy mix was very timely and helped to reduce our exposure to the uncertainties of that market, particularly for oil supplies.  At the time, however, there did not exist an established natural gas industry with the potential to absorb the flow of gas from the Kinsale Head field in sufficient quantity to remunerate the huge capital investment involved.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the Government decided to allocate a significant amount of the gas for a new plant to be built by Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marina Point in Cork for the production of ammonia and urea for the fertiliser industry and for additional ESB generating capacity in a new power station at Aghada and the conversion of an existing plant at Marina, both plants being located in Cork.  In addition, an allocation of gas was made available to Cork Gas Company to meet the requirements of their consumers.  It was decided also that NET and the ESB should jointly negotiate the price of the gas with Marathon.  When BGE was subsequently set up it took over responsibility for gas purchasing arrangements with Marathon, resulting in an agreement governing the arrangements and prices for the sale and supply of natural gas from Kinsale Head.</P>
    <P>Marathon discovered further natural gas in the nearby Ballycotton field in 1987 which was the subject of a separate agreement with BGE.  In 1995 a new Marathon/BGE agreement was signed to replace the earlier agreements which would have expired in 1999 and to deal with the sale and purchase of gas produced at Kinsale Head/ allycotton post-1996.</P>
    <P>The ESB and NET are still the main natural gas consumers, consuming about 50 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, of total gas sales.  The Kinsale Head/Ballycotton reserves are in decline and are expected to be exhausted for commercial purposes by about 2003.  As a consequence BGE now also purchases gas from other suppliers and is importing 50 per cent of its gas requirements through the interconnector pipeline with Scotland resulting in indigenous reserves playing a decreasing role.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for gas, reflecting the accelerated growth in the economy. Because of the high growth in demand I recently launched a major study into future gas needs to the year 2025 to ensure that any necessary infrastructural enhancements are identified and put in place in good time.  The study is a joint project between my Department and BGE and should be completed by the autumn.</P>
    <P>A joint North/South study of the feasibility of providing a natural gas interconnector between Dublin and Belfast was completed last year.  The study report concluded that such an interconnector <Col N="442" /> is technically possible and represents the most cost effective potential solution considered in relation to gas supply issues on both sides of the Border.  The report is a valuable contribution towards policy making in relation to gas infrastructure requirements.  It represents an excellent example of cross-Border co-operation in the energy sector in that officials from my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, Bord Gais Éireann and Phoenix Natural Gas Limited participated in the study.  The findings of the report are now being considered as part of the 2025 gas demand study.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty require that all contracting parties work to alleviate market distortions and barriers to competition in the energy sector.  The main objective of the treaty is to stimulate investment by the West in the energy sector in eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union in an effort to aid their transition to market economies.  It is expected also to provide for long-term co-operation between western and eastern Europe in the energy field and by so doing improve security of supply, maximise the efficiency of production, conversion, transport, distribution and use of energy, enhance safety and minimise environmental problems for their mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>Over 50 countries have signed the treaty and 34 have ratified it to date.  The treaty entered into force on 16 April this year and from that date became a binding instrument of international law. All member states of the European Union have signed the treaty and all but two, including Ireland, have ratified it to date.  While the idea for the energy charter, which eventually led to the negotiation of the treaty, was first mooted in the European Union, other countries of western and eastern Europe, the states of the former Soviet Union and many of the non-European members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development supported the idea and entered into the negotiations.  Ireland has participated in the negotiations on the treaty at EU level and in the wider negotiations.  We have always enthusiastically supported the aims of the treaty and I am anxious that we ratify it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 37 of the 1976 Act will not cause a problem for the purchase of natural gas supplies by BGE.  The board will still be able to bid for the purchase of natural gas whether discovered within the jurisdiction or otherwise and continue to transmit, distribute and sell gas for industrial, commercial and residential purposes. In the event of an energy crisis affecting the State and where there would be a need to control the use of energy sources, there is provision in the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts to enable the making of orders governing the acquisition, supply, distribution and marketing of natural gas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the widespread demand for health care and personal social services, the fact that in many areas this demand is not being met and the certainty that demand will increase in the future, as also will the costs associated with providing those services, noting, in particular, the urgent need&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to provide more hospital beds and to attack hospital waiting lists,</P>
      <P>&mdash;to make further and more effective provision in the areas of care for children, the elderly and persons with mental disability, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to develop a comprehensive system of care in the community,</P>
      <P>bearing in mind that Irish <i>per capita</i> spending is among the lowest in the European Union, and believing that the present period of economic expansion should return a dividend to the people by way of a major and sustained increase in funds committed to the public health system, calls on the Government&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to declare a target figure for public health expenditure, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and</P>
      <P>(2) to commit itself to a programme of spending increases until that figure is achieved and to the maintenance of spending at that level.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is threefold.  We want to highlight the major inadequacies in our health services, prioritise the areas which are in need of substantial funding and establish a resource framework to develop our health care services over the next decade in order to bring them up to an acceptable level which is, in some way, commensurate with our growing economic wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our motion is informed by one principle; economic growth is not an end in itself but must lead on to improved living standards and a better quality <Col N="444" /> of life for our citizens.  If it is to be a source of social solidarity and inclusion, its effects must be evident in all sectors of society.  It must be used to address the deficiencies of the past, of which there are many, and it must evolve to tackle the reasonable, growing demands which progress creates.  That has clearly not yet happened.  In spite of the existence of social partnership, the feeling remains that the main beneficiaries of recent economic progress have been the well off.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains a very divided society.  The decisions taken in the area of taxation in this Government's first budget clearly exacerbated tensions in this area.  The division in Irish society is nowhere more apparent than within our health system.  In recent years, much effort has been put into the development of our economy.  Thankfully, this has resulted in unprecedented economic growth.  We now need to put the same kind of concerted effort into developing our society so that it can accommodate the needs of all our citizens. That means putting community at the top of the political agenda and spending money where it is needed most.  What is the point, one might ask, of having an extra few pounds in one's pocket if one is going to be turned away from a casualty department because of a shortage of beds?  What is the point if an elderly parent cannot get into a nursing home?  What is the point if child care services remain over-stretched leaving many children at risk?  How can we feel good about our booming economy when elderly parents must struggle with a mentally handicapped son or daughter because there are insufficient places for them in care?  How can we feel good about our society when vital home help workers are being paid less that £2 per hour?</P>
    <P>The motion sets out some of the challenges which face our public health system and with which Members will be familiar.  We have debated these on many pervious occasions.  They include the provision of services for the elderly, the young &mdash; particularly children at risk &mdash; those in need of acute services and those with particular disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has published two significant documents in recent times.  The first strategy document, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, appeared in 1994.  More recently, the Department published its own strategy statement for 1998 to 2001.  Both documents are a welcome contribution to the debate on this issue but until funding is addressed these documents remain largely aspirational.</P>
    <P>The existence of long hospital waiting lists is a major source of public concern.  The latest available figures reveal that more than 32,000 people are currently on hospital waiting lists.  While this figure represents a fall from the 1993 high of 40,000, it also represents a significant increase of more than 6,000 from the 26,000 mark achieved by the previous Government.  Up to 25 per cent of operations are being cancelled in some hospitals because of the shortage of hospital beds.  Almost 1,000 adults have been waiting more than 12 <Col N="445" /> months for cardiac surgery and a similar number await plastic surgery.  The vast majority of children on hospital waiting lists have been on the lists for more than 12 months.  In Ireland, it remains true that if one needs an operation and can afford to pay for it, it is available but if one is dependent on public care, one faces long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Although this Government set out its intention to tackle these lists, it has clearly failed to do so. The Minister established a review group to examine hospital waiting lists and it is due to report by the end of June.  I welcomed the Minister's initiative but did so on the condition that resources would be put in place to tackle the immediate crisis.  Unfortunately, no such move has been made and we now face the prospect of a further crisis in our hospitals next winter.</P>
    <P>I guarantee that one of the group's main findings will be that a large number of acute hospital beds are being blocked.  In the Eastern Health Board area alone it is accepted that there are approximately 300 patients in acute hospital beds who should not be there.  This figure comprises elderly people who are unable to gain access to nursing homes, chronically sick people in need of long-term care and many other patients in need of rehabilitation who simply have nowhere else to go.  For these beds to be freed up for those awaiting operations, funding must be provided to accommodate those who are currently inappropriately placed.</P>
    <P>Much of the progress in the hospital waiting list initiative over the past five years has been based on a quicker turnover of patients.  Since 1980, there has been a reduction of 3,500 in the number of hospital beds.  This is an area of growing concern to the public who are increasingly uneasy with the hospital as a conveyor belt syndrome. While the reduction in the length of time spent in hospital has been welcomed by many working in the area of hospital economics, the public tends to take a different view which is that the conveyor belt approach is not necessarily in patients' best interests.</P>
    <P>Equally immediate is the crisis in child care.  A plethora of commitments currently await implementation; these include the establishment of a child care authority, an ombudsman for children, a social services inspectorate and an increased number of foster places for children who are currently awaiting placement.  The renaming of the Department of Health as the Department of Health and Children helped to create the impression that this was an area the Government would take seriously.  However, as in many other areas, this proved to be yet another exercise in window dressing.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Irish Government was severely criticised by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child for its failure to address adequately the needs of children.  The UN report expressed serious concern about inadequacies in our child care services.  These services are crisis driven at all levels.  The lack of availability of suitable <Col N="446" /> places for children often leads to them being housed in hospitals because there is nowhere else for them to go.  Large numbers of other children are left in situations where they are seriously at risk.</P>
    <P>We should be deeply ashamed that this situation is allowed to persist.  Piecemeal attempts to tackle the problem have failed.  What is needed is an overall assessment of the scale of the problem, a strategic plan to tackle it over a defined period and a Government commitment to fund that plan. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, indicated that the financial requirements in this area alone are in excess of £100 million.  I believe this is an accurate assessment.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons Ireland has been able to maintain a reasonable standard of care, despite its low <i>per capita</i> spending, has been the relative youth of its population.  An OECD report last year indicated that while the health of our younger people is as good as that of younger people in other OECD countries, the health of our elderly compares unfavourably.  The health disadvantage in Ireland is primarily based in this sector.  There have been welcome improvements in recent years but the challenges ahead are immense.</P>
    <P>Over the next decade, our population will age considerably.  Projected estimates indicate there will be an additional 100,000 people over the age of 65 years by 2010.  There is already massive pressure on existing services, such as nursing homes.  The current rates of subvention from the health boards for nursing home care are hopelessly inadequate to meet the expenses involved. Many families are put under severe pressure because of this and there is an urgent need to update the rates.  Equally, health board nursing homes cannot cope with the growing demands on them.</P>
    <P>There is huge under-provision of day care services for the elderly.  The existing situation puts enormous strain on older people and on their families, both financially and emotionally.  These problems are likely to increase substantially and will require additional investment by the State. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is aware of this.  He has met a number of groups who are working to improve the lot of older people.  In the Dublin area where there is a major concentration of this age group, there are no day care services. People are marooned in their homes, isolated and lonely, and we have not put in place the type of services these people require and deserve.</P>
    <P>The situation in many other areas of health service is equally appalling.  Ireland is enjoying the most prosperous period in its history, yet over 3,000 people with mental handicap are being denied services.  There is an urgent need for day services for 1,200 people who currently have no such service.  A further 1,300 people who urgently require residential services do not have them and an additional 1,200 people are currently inappropriately placed in various large old institutions throughout the country.  The fact that these placements <Col N="447" /> are allowed to continue is a disgrace.  The conditions in some of those old institutions are shameful but there appears to be no political will to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the need with regard to mental handicap.  Over the past few years there have been small incremental improvements in this area.  Little by little, the allocation to mental handicap services has grown and that has been welcomed by parents and agencies working in the area.  However, much of the pressure for services was staved off while the database was being compiled by the health boards.  I told a public meeting on this issue last year that as soon as the database was completed, the exact need would be known and, because we would know how many people were in dire need of services, there would be no running away from it.</P>
    <P>I could not believe that this Government would run away from the stark figure of over 3,000 people in urgent need of services.  In the last budget, a capital allocation of a mere £7 million was made for mental handicap services.  This allocation was made at a time when it was known that £63 million was needed to deal with the problem.  The allocation of £7 million was the smallest capital allocation made to mental handicap services in the last five years.</P>
    <P>If we continue to proceed through small incremental improvements, we will alienate many people.  Large numbers of people are currently being denied their basic human rights because the State has denied them the resources to live a life of dignity.  Since 1980, expenditure on health as a percentage of our GDP has fallen considerably. This fall has been influenced by a number of factors.  The difficult economic situation in the 1980s necessitated a considerable reappraisal of existing services and although the figure climbed somewhat during the early to mid 1990s, the recent spectacular economic growth has not been matched by a commensurate increase in health spending.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes it is time to take a fresh look at this situation.  Many of our services are hopelessly inadequate.  They reflect to a great extent where we have come from as a society rather than where we are now.  Ireland continues to record lower health status indicators than other European countries.  The main focus of attention is on acute services but if one looks at what is happening at community level, and there is general agreement that we must concentrate our services there, one can see that only lip service is being paid to the many people who work in community care services.</P>
    <P>All Members are aware of the huge shortages in community care services.  There are waiting lists of between 18 months and two years for occupational therapy services.  There are inadequate chiropody services.  Day care services are hopelessly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Much lip service is paid to the vital role of home help workers in our community services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The move from institutional to community care in recent years has necessitated the involvement of large numbers of people providing home help. However, we do not appear to be prepared to put our money where our mouths are in this regard. It is shameful that large numbers of people who provide vital support services in terms of home help are being paid derisory amounts.  Over the years the State has saved significant amounts of money by moving people out of big institutions and into the community.  Yet all we can do is praise the good work of those who volunteer to become home helps.  We should be ashamed of the derisory rates of pay allocated to those people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that in order to address inadequacies in our health services considerable progress will have to be made in the years ahead.  To facilitate a proper and phased improvement in these services it is important for Government to set clear targets.  Such an approach to tackling a problem is not unprecedented. Clear targets were put in place for increasing aid to developing countries and to a large extent those targets have been met.  What is required is the political will to tackle a pressing problem.</P>
    <P>The motion cites increases in health spending as a percentage of GDP.  The Labour Party is not wedded in absolute terms to this measure.  It was chosen because it is the internationally accepted measurement.  The principle underpinning the motion is that as society becomes more affluent additional resources need to be committed to the health system.  Standing still is simply not acceptable. Improvements are urgently needed over a wide range of services.</P>
    <P>In its last budget the Government reduced capital gains taxation by 50 per cent.  The cost to the Exchequer of this move is estimated to be more than £40 million.  No doubt that cost has been added to by the inclusion in the second Finance Bill this year of provisions for land rezoning for residential development.  Those measures have brought no social benefit whatsoever.  Those two measures taken together would have been sufficient to pay for the needs of all our mentally handicapped people.  These are the choices a Government must make.  They are the options that are open to it at budget time, but the choices made in the last budget were seriously flawed and bad for society.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is intended as a constructive contribution towards general debate on this important issue.  It does not lambaste the Government for its failures, although failures in the health area have been considerable.  Rather it sets out a platform on which to build the progressive health care system for our people as we approach the end of this century.  For that reason it is worthy of serious consideration and, I hope, support.  I call on the Government to accept it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  A well managed, patient, focused public health service is a cornerstone of any civic society.  At this time of unprecedented economic growth it is imperative the Government takes action to tackle the serious crisis that afflicts our health service.  The Labour Party believes that economic growth is not an end in itself.  The benefits of economic growth must be used to enhance and improve the well being of citizens.  Investing in our health service is the most appropriate and important public investment the State can make and it should be a priority for all administrations.  Many areas of our health services do not have resources available to meet the demand.  For example, there are currently more than 32,000 people on hospital waiting lists.  Child care services are at breaking point with health boards struggling under a huge backlog. More than 3,000 people with a mental handicap require residential and day places.  Our elderly population is bereft of services.</P>
      <P>That is only a sample of the crises currently facing our health service and forms the background to the Labour Party's motion before the House.  The text of the motion is positive and constructive. We do not want to turn this issue into a political football.  The public who rely on our health services deserve better.  In the motion we wish to highlight problems facing our health service, encourage people to recognise that those problems can be overcome only through strategic planning and to urge the Government to establish a system of health funding that will harness the benefits of economic growth and invest them in our health system.  I hope the Government will appreciate the spirit in which this motion is moved and accept the logic behind our proposals. The course of action proposed will not only improve funding for our health service, it will produce a more transparent system of health funding upon which the public can judge the performance of a Government in improving our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in any debate such as this to recognise the enormous stress the current crisis in our health system places on health professionals. Nurses, doctors, social workers and auxiliary personnel are placed under extreme pressure by shortfalls in resources.  They are the people in the front line who have to deal with the understandable anger of patients who face cancellations and delays on a daily basis.  Health care professionals perform a heroic service under difficult conditions, but we cannot operate a system where every health care worker must possess the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon to tackle their day's work.  Instituting reform in our health service such as that proposed in this motion will relieve the pressure under which health care professionals work and dedicate their energies and <Col N="450" /> talents towards patient care rather than crisis management.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to outline some of the health service problems that occur in County Kildare.  The reason I do so is twofold.  First, as a representative for the people of south Kildare I am committed to bringing to the attention of the Minister at every opportunity the serious problems facing our health services.  Second, I want to reinforce the point that improvements in our health services on a national level must have a real and meaningful effect on services on the ground.  It is only when the problems faced on a day to day basis by public health service consumers and staff are removed that we can say we have made a real difference.</P>
    <P>Like many large general hospitals, Naas General Hospital has an ongoing bed shortage.  The total number of beds in the hospital consistently remains below the number of patients requiring care and accommodation.  On some occasions the hospital has had to accommodate more than 160 patients while it has capacity for only 129.  Every day in the months of January and February of the past year the number of patients in Naas General Hospital exceeded the number of beds, except on one day when the number of beds just satisfied the number of patients.  This has led to a position where for hours on end patients have had to sit in chairs and lie on trolleys in the hospital corridor while waiting for a bed to become free.  In addition to those intolerable circumstances, basic facilities such as toilets and showers are totally inappropriate and need to be improved radically to deal with the demand.</P>
    <P>Naas General Hospital is no different from dozens of hospitals throughout the country.  My colleague, Deputy Stagg, has consistently raised with the Minister the severe pressure faced by the accident and emergency unit in James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown.  The position in James Connolly Memorial Hospital and Naas General Hospital is indicative of that in hospitals where the population in the catchment area has outstripped the facilities offered by the hospital.  The problems faced by these hospitals can be resolved only by increased funding and better long-term management.  These are the core aims of this motion.  Increased funding is required to improve Naas General Hospital.  However, neither I nor my party believes that sinking money into health services will, on its own, produce the necessary resources.  The increased funding the motion would bring on stream must be targeted correctly to ensure that every hospital ward and patient benefits.  Proper targeting of the increased funding over a sustained period would enable health service managers to strategically plan the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>It is obvious the hospital bed crisis affecting every health board region relates to the lack of specialist care facilities in the State.  For example, many elderly people recuperating from serious surgery are currently accommodated in ordinary hospital wards.  This contributes to the hospital <Col N="451" /> bed crisis and is the result of the inability of health boards to strategically plan delivery of their services.  The matter must be addressed urgently, not only to relieve our current logjam, but to ensure a better standard of care for those currently in general hospitals who require more specialised care.</P>
    <P>In addition to conditions pertaining in our general hospitals, the health service is also failing to adequately support those members of the community who care for seriously ill and infirm relatives, often at great personal sacrifice to their own lives and that of their families.  Many relatives have had to leave the workforce to care for parents or grandparents who are seriously ill and the system has failed to provide a scheme to compensate those people for the losses they incur. Although the numbers of people involved are not great, the State would make a strong statement about the centrality of family life if people who must take this course of action were compensated for their loss.</P>
    <P>The home help and home attendant scheme is a major problem in our health system.  It is ironic that home helps employed by health boards are among the workers with most to gain from the introduction of a statutory minimum wage.  For too long people working in this sector have been taken for granted by the State and are not adequately rewarded for their wonderful work.  I urge the Minister to tackle this matter without delay.  There should be a common rate for home helps throughout health boards and, at the very least, it must be in the order of £4.40 an hour, the rate proposed as the introductory level for the minimum wage.  This basic wage must be granted to home help and home attendant workers as a matter of urgency.  They perform an invaluable service to the community and their work and dedication saves the State millions of pounds each year in reduced nursing home costs.  It is a national disgrace that their efforts have been ignored for many years.  Their pay and conditions must be improved immediately to the basic standard recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also examine the orthodontic service.  Many parents who attend my clinics have great difficult getting orthodontic treatment for their children at primary and post-primary level.  Also, incapacitated persons or people with serious health problems should not have to pay the maximum telephone charge for a call to a health board outside their district.  I urge the Minister to set up a free phone line for health boards.</P>
    <P>The concessionary grant which allowed an area administrator to sanction a DPG grant has been withdrawn.  Hundreds of applications have been submitted for DPG grants in Kildare but there is no funding.  Although the health board had funding available, the persons with a disability have to suffer because area administrators cannot draw down funding from the local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The crises facing the people of Kildare and the wider community served by the Eastern Health Board are not unique.  They exist in every health board area.  This motion proposes to increase the health budget to facilitate immediate improvements and proposes a system of funding that would be increased steadily over a number of years.  This would enable local health service managers to strategically plan for future developments as demographic changes and population shifts become apparent.  This is a constructive motion.  It does not seek to make political capital out of the pain and suffering endured by patients waiting for treatment.  It maps out a new future for health service funding whereby the needs of our health service would be a national priority and funding could be utilised in a strategic manner. More importantly, it is a system of funding that focuses on the standard of care delivered to patients and their families.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity for this important debate on the financing and provision <Col N="453" /> of health services.  I apologise that the Minister for Health and Children is unable to attend this evening's debate.  Unfortunately, he was called away urgently, but he will contribute to the debate tomorrow evening.</P>
      <P>A number of basic facts confront anyone examining the provision of health services.  There is a deeply held belief that there should be proper public funding of our health services to ensure quality care is available to those who need it. Despite substantial investment in these services by successive Governments, there remains a significant amount of unmet need and health care is by its nature expensive to provide.  Those three essential facts add up to the realisation that there is unlikely ever to be sufficient resources to do all that is required.  Faced with this reality there must be planning for the necessary improvement of services within the parameters of what is achievable.</P>
      <P>The motion from the Labour Party proposes fixing health expenditure at a particular percentage of gross domestic product.  There is no easy answer to what is the appropriate level of health spending for any one country.  If we look to other countries for guidance we find that within the OECD there is substantial variation in the <i>per capita</i> spend on health.  One reason for this variation may be the underlying differences in health care needs attributable to population structures or patterns of disease.</P>
      <P>In addition, real differences in the cost of providing health care exist between countries due to factors such as population density and the relative earnings of health professionals.  The level of health care provided will also, quite properly, be influenced by the values of a society and the priority attached to health care over other services. It is important also to note that when comparing expenditure on health in a number of countries, measurement differences are likely to arise.  The OECD when compiling such figures strives to standardise the comparative data for each country but some distortion is likely to arise where activities which fall within the health domain in one country are recorded by other countries under different expenditure headings.</P>
      <P>International comparison, while useful, cannot yield a sole objective measure of the amount of resources a nation should devote to health services. International comparison shows, however, that the level of total resources available within an economy influences the amount spent on health.  It would be expected that richer countries would spend more on health in absolute terms and Ireland's low ranking in terms of <i>per capita</i> spend within both the European Union and the OECD reflects the fact that our income <i>per capita</i> has historically been below that of our EU and OECD partners.  Our recent economic success means that our standard of living is beginning to converge towards these international averages; the judgment to be made is the rate at which we should increase our health expenditure in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> This Government has already provided a 10 per cent increase in non-capital funding in the current year and I will take the opportunity later to provide an update on these issues which will be considered by the House.  Increases for health must be compatible with the overall macro-economic framework adopted by this Government.</P>
    <P>As a Government we are determined to carefully manage the economy and our success in this area should allow us to plan for increased resources being available to Health.  Continued economic success is the key to improving our social services since this will supply the base on which progress can be sustained over the medium term.  It is important to remember that every new development in health services must be supported in the long-term, even in times of relative scarcity.</P>
    <P>More than £3 billion in non-capital funding will be spent on the public health services in 1998. This represents about £8.2 million for every day of the year.  In seeking further support from the Exchequer it is incumbent on all of us in the health services to ensure that the most cost effective use is being made of our current resources. There is always room for progress and recent reforms within the health services have focused on improving organisational and funding relationships to target resources at areas of greatest need and to bring about a greater ethos of customer service.</P>
    <P>While continuing effort is required we should not dismiss our current level of achievement. There are pressures within our services but we are not unique in this.  Shortages and deficiencies exist in most health services many of which absorb much greater amounts of money than our own.</P>
    <P>The OECD with its international experience is ideally placed to comment on the relative position of our services.  In its recent review of the health services the OECD concluded that:</P>
    <P>The Irish health system.  .. has resulted in a good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Examining some of the detail of this report it can be seen, for example, that substantial increases in the productivity of Irish hospitals were identified. The average length of stay in hospitals was seen to have reduced by 29 per cent since 1980, while better management of hospitals also delivered an increase in the bed occupancy rate to 85 per cent over this period.  Since 1987 there has been a 3 per cent annual increase in the number of cases treated in our hospitals with a quadrupling of the number of patients treated on a day case basis. Day cases now represent about 40 per cent of all throughput.</P>
    <P>While the overall assessment of our services is positive, it is the case that significant further progress is required.  Nineteen ninety eight is the first full year in which this Government has been able to address the necessary improvements in our health services.  The net non-capital provision for <Col N="455" /> health in 1998 shows a 10 per cent increase over and above the 1997 outturn.</P>
    <P>Further progress has also been made in the capital programme which shows a 12 per cent increase over the 1997 outturn.  These increases will allow significant progress to be made during the current year in implementing the Government commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion seeks an increase in the number of hospital beds.  However the evolution of hospital medicine means that bed numbers are a crude measure of the productive capacity of a hospital.  What is much more significant is the ability of a modern hospital to respond to the demand for day care treatment which can be less costly than overnight treatment and care. Also, many more patients can be treated in day care units.</P>
    <P>The proper use of outpatient departments is also vital in ensuring that hospitals respond effectively to genuine demand.  Therefore, the simple counting of hospital beds is not valid.  It is true there has been a decrease in the number of overnight hospital beds compared to ten years ago. However, there has been a significant growth in productivity in that period essentially in day care and outpatient treatment.</P>
    <P>While people speak frequently of bed shortages the real issue is that our hospitals, due to the pressure on them, at times may not be able to treat sufficient numbers of elective surgical cases while also managing emergency admissions. Therefore, we must plan to ensure that all general hospital beds are used for those who require appropriate treatment and those patients who are in need of more long-stay care should be cared for in a more appropriate environment.</P>
    <P>All of this means there must be a package of initiatives which are directed towards lessening the pressure on acute hospital beds.  The package must involve: setting up new facilities for the elderly and chronically sick following appropriate acute hospital stay; developments to relieve pressure on the accident and emergency departments of our general hospitals; co-operation between local general practitioners and general hospitals in the continuing care of patients; focused waiting list initiatives; and, in general, an unceasing concentration on efforts to ensure that the general hospital programme, which consumes almost 50 per cent of total health expenditure, delivers a cost effective service.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, very simplistic for the crude counting of bed numbers to be used as a meaningful measure to determine whether our hospital bed stock is sufficient.  The issues are too complex for that simple analysis to have any validity.  If one looks at the OECD report on the health services, it can be seen that the services here are delivering a significant growth in productivity. The challenge must be for all of us involved in health services to maintain the increase in productivity <Col N="456" /> so that the taxpayer receives value for money.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on developments in relation to services for the elderly which, as Minister of State, is one of my key areas of responsibility. The increase in the population of older people, particularly the elderly population, and the care needs of this group will be one of the key issues to be addressed by the health services in the coming years.  It is estimated that the older population will grow by almost 108,000 in the period 1996 to 2011, bringing the overall percentage to 14.1 per cent.  Significantly, there will proportionately be a bigger increase in the numbers aged 80 years or more who are the most dependent category and the biggest users of long stay nursing home care.  The number of over 80 year olds will rise from 21.9 per cent of the over 65 population in 1996 to 24.9 per cent in 2011.</P>
    <P>The challenge to the health services is to reorganise existing services and develop new strategies and services to ensure that ill and dependent older people get the most effective care.  It is widely recognised that there is a need for improvements in the social, economic and physical well being of our older citizens.  We will endeavour to do this during the lifetime of this Government.  The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, which was published in 1988, provides a framework for the development of health, personal social services and housing to assist older people.  The cornerstone of policy towards older people recommended in the report is to support older people at home in dignity and independence and, when this is no longer possible, to ensure that ill and dependent older people have access to the highest quality hospital and residential care when they require it.  The report outlined what needed to be done to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People recently published a review of &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo;.  This review provides us with a comprehensive evaluation of the extent to which the recommendations of &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; have been implemented and points to areas where a reorientation of policy may be required.  This valuable document will help us in shaping future policy on services for older people.  With my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, I will endeavour to deal with some of the service shortcomings for older people identified in the national council's report over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In the current year we have put over £7 million additional revenue funding into health services for older people.  This will provide, among other things, staffing for new and existing community nursing units and expansion of community services to improve support for older people in their homes.  Funding has also been provided for the establishment of specialist services for older people with mental health problems.  In addition, a capital programme for older people is close to completion.  The programme will involve a significant <Col N="457" /> increase in the level of resources previously made available.  It is the intention that this investment will accelerate the provision of extended care facilities, including community nursing units and day care facilities for older people throughout the country, as well as enhancing existing services. A separate non-capital sum of £4 million was provided in 1998 specifically for the cost of subventions towards the cost of care of older people in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Food safety is one of my areas of particular responsibility and substantial progress has been made during 1998.  Funding was provided in the 1998 Vote to allow for setting up the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The authority has been established on an interim basis by way of statutory instrument under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, with effect from 1 January 1998.  This arrangement will allow the authority to recruit staff and put in place the necessary structures in advance of the Bill being enacted. The Bill has now been published and Second Stage will be taken in the Dáil on 3 or 4 June.</P>
    <P>The authority will carry out inspections, approvals, licensing and registration of food premises and equipment through the contracts negotiated with the agencies.  Where circumstances warrant, the authority's remit shall extend to farms, other places of primary production, water treatment plants and any other source of materials used in food production.  It will be responsible for the inspection, sampling and analysis of food and inspection of labelling.  In the area of food safety assurance schemes, it will be responsible for the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation, storage and handling.  In the formulation of national food policy, the authority will have an advisory role in areas such as food-borne disease and nutrition.</P>
    <P>The board of the authority will consist of ten members, including a chairman, appointed by the Minister for Health and Children.  The Bill also provides for a scientific committee which will have 15 members appointed by the Minister in consultation with the board.  The chairman of the scientific committee will also be a member of the board.  The Minister, in appointing members, will have regard to relevant scientific qualifications and experience.  The scientific committee will advise on matters referred by the board pertaining to scientific or technical questions, food inspection and nutrition.  The board will await the scientific committee's response before deciding any matter referred.  This provision is to guarantee the science based nature of the authority.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the authority has access to a broad base of views, it will also have a consultative council representative of the wide range of food safety interests.  The Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the board of the authority will nominate the membership of this council.  The overall thrust of the Bill is to provide the reassurance <Col N="458" /> that consumers seek in the important area of food safety.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children will speak tomorrow night on the developments he has put in place in 1998 and his plans for the future.  In addition to my ministerial responsibilities, as a local Deputy I have a keen interest in the provision of services in the Western Health Board area.  I was happy with the significant provisions made in 1998 for the development of services in the region.  Some £7 million was provided specifically for the development of services.  This is over and above general increases for pay, inflation and other increases not related directly to service provision.  For example, over £1 million has been provided for the development of cancer services, £500,000 million for the commissioning of new acute units in University College Hospital Galway and Roscommon hospital, £630,000 for the ambulance services, £650,000 for physical disability services, £742,000 for child care services, £900,000 for services for the elderly, £500,000 for the development of dental services and £867,000 in respect of the waiting list initiative.  These sums are reflective of the general development of services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards capital developments initiated in the Western Health Board region, the development at University College Hospital, Galway, is under way, while other hospital schemes are at various stages of planning, including Mayo General Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>This Government recognises the pressing needs within the health services and the 1998 Vote provision makes a significant start in addressing them.  Specifically, the funding provided allows us to begin to meet the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium and to achieve the objectives set out in my Department's strategy statement, &ldquo;Working for Health and Well-Being&rdquo;. The Minister for Health and Children will seek increased funding for the health services in the context of the multi-annual budget exercise covering the years 1999-2001 to deal with the increased cost of the core service provision.  These costs arise due to pressures caused by new technology, demographic factors, legislative obligations and other factors.  The second area for which funding is required is to continue progress already under way in meeting the capital and revenue commitments in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>It will not be easy to secure the necessary increased funding, given the genuine demands for increases from other Departments and the requirement on the Government to balance the overall picture in order that the nation's current economic performance can be sustained.</P>
    <P>I share the views of our Labour colleagues that additional resources should be devoted to the health services.  I am equally sure the House will agree this must be achieved in a balanced and <Col N="459" /> equitable manner having regard to the overall viability of our economy.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The health service has an insatiable appetite and no matter what amount is allocated to it, it is difficult to satisfy all demands. This motion which has come from the Labour Party smacks of opportunism and leaves that party open to a left upper cut.  That party has a short memory.  In Government it was tight fisted and uncaring and did not show a great deal of concern for health issues.  In Opposition it has become irresponsible once more and claims more and more money is the panacea for everything. The Labour Party was in Government with Fine Gael for two and a half years.

      <P>Deputy Bradford will agree the southern health board hospitals in Cork were totally ignored by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan.  He starved Cork University Hospital of funds.  He did not recognise the difficulties in that hospital.  The greatest insult was that the Minister did not visit the main hospital in the Southern Health Board area to view the difficulties which we outlined here on many occasions.  He forgot to give it money for equipment.  In an independent report he forgot there was a shortage of the order of 90 consultants, yet none were appointed during his term of office.  He forgot that a building programme had to be carried out.  He forgot that major waiting list strategies had to be attended to.  In contrast &mdash; and within weeks of being in Government &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Cowen, visited Cork University Hospital, met staff, students and management and saw at first hand the difficulties in the Southern Health Board area. Immediately he made money available: £2 million for equipment and for consultancy appointments whether cancer, oncology or accident and emergency. As a member of the Southern Health Board this was the first time I saw a direct interest being taken in Cork by the Minister.  An additional £2 million has been provided for nursing and consultancy services.  Money has been provided for community services, physical disability, <Col N="460" /> the elderly and child care services.  The funding provided for cardiac services and cardiology in Cork has been doubled in those two areas and the number of procedures has doubled from 265 to well over 500 per annum as a result of the Minister's intervention.  While there are still problems there has been a major increase in the funding provided.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to undertake a nationwide survey.  I am concerned at the number of people who turn up at accident and emergency departments.  What percentage of those people should be in accident and emergency departments?  On one day in Cork University Hospital 78 people went through the accident and emergency department.  Some 17 of those people should not have been in the accident and emergency department.  How widespread is that practice?</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that one-third of those entering the accident and emergency departments should not be there.  Should more people be treated in GP surgeries?  Are more people by-passing GP surgeries?  Is there a difficulty in answering call-outs at night?  Are people going directly to the accident and emergency departments? For the benefit of those who are to be processed in accident and emergency departments in the future such a review is necessary. The difficulties for staff and consultants in accident and emergency departments include the number of beds occupied, the amount of time wasted when needy patients could receive treatment earlier, the number of hours people have to wait which could be reduced.  In that area alone significant adjustments could be made.  For that reason it is important that that matter be examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister has placed great emphasis on examining waiting lists and waiting times.  It is not right that children and elderly people should have to wait for treatment for six or 12 months.  In the short time since the Minister came into office he has increased the level of funding to reduce waiting lists from £8 million in 1997 to £12 million. Also an independent review body is examining the waiting list initiative and hoping to report back to him at the end of June.  This will avoid simplistic solutions and allow us to analyse the causes of the problem and ensure we have identified the best way of dealing with those problems.</P>
      <P>Last year this Minister was happy to provide £16 million for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This is made up of additional funding of £10.75 million for revenue and capital funding of £5.25 million in 1998 to continue the process of delivering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Our objective should be to ensure we do not develop a two-tier health service which is structurally put in place and which results in immediate health care being available to those who can afford it and those who have access to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, BUPA and, in particular, the higher cost insurance schemes, and have in place a secondary service which results in people who require vital surgery and medical care being left endlessly on hospital waiting lists.  We should have an inclusive and not an exclusive health service.</P>
      <P>I commend the motion from Deputy Shortall which the Fine Gael Party will support.  It is appropriate to examine where we stand with the health service, the promises made by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil at the last general election with regard to what they would do to improve the health service, and the programme for Government they put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment to the Labour Party's motion tabled by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, does not bear any credibility.  He asked the Dáil <Col N="462" /> to note with approval the range of commitments contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and the determination to implement these developments within the life of the Government.  For a determined group of people they have achieved very little because in the proposals contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium &mdash; a rather inappropriately named document which should be called the inaction programme &mdash; a number of key priorities are listed.  Not one of these priorities has been fully implemented or addressed in a manner that would have been expected by the electorate that supported these two parties.  I do not have the time to go through each of the items listed but suffice to say that the Government has abysmally failed to implement any of its designated priorities in its health programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the Minister constantly looking at the hospital waiting lists.  My image of the Minister and the hospital waiting lists is that when he is looking at them he is doing so with a bemused expression on his face because under this Government the hospital waiting lists, which had started to shrink during the lifetime of the previous Government, have continued to grow.  Hospital waiting list figures of 26,000 up to the end of December, inherited by this Government, have now grown to almost 32,500.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the hospital waiting lists and the manner in which the Government is dealing with statistics.  This Government is seeking to suppress the true nature of the hospital waiting lists to ensure that when statistical information becomes available, it is so outdated as to fail to give us a clear indicator of where we stand with our hospital services.  It is my understanding that quarterly figures are prepared by the health boards and submitted to the Department to indicate the state of hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that when I, in a Dáil question today, sought the up to date figures as at 31 March 1998 I am told, possibly because of this debate, that the only figures available are those to the end of December 1997.  It should have been possible to have the up-to-date figures available for this debate indicating the state of hospital waiting lists at the end of the first quarter of 1998. This is from a Government which produced Working for Health and Wellbeing and talks about improving and facilitating the availability of information.  It is not good enough that we do not have those figures and I challenge the Minister for Health and Children, who will address this debate tomorrow, to produce the up-to-date hospital waiting list figures.  If he cannot do so he should tell the House the reason.</P>
    <P>The waiting list figures have continued to grow at an unacceptable rate placing the lives of those in need of essential surgery at risk.  The accident and emergency departments of hospitals throughout the State too frequently resemble a chaotic war zone with patients left unattended and in pain.  There has been a collapse in public confidence in the ability of some health boards to provide <Col N="463" /> essential protection for children at risk, and totally unacceptable delays in the commencement of investigations into allegations of child abuse. To date, the Minister has totally failed to bring into operation the breast cancer and cervical cancer screening programmes.  He has failed to address the need for a prostate cancer screening programme.</P>
    <P>The new Tallaght hospital has difficulties that I have regularly raised both inside and outside the House.  This hospital, which should be a starship within our medical system with a trust of a unique nature set up to run it, has been starved of essential resources by the Minister.  On opening day, more than half the operating theatres in the hospital will remain closed.  Seven dialysis stations will remain closed.  Physiotherapy and hydrotherapy facilities will remain closed.  Major hydrotherapy facilities built to benefit physiotherapy patients are being covered by a temporary flooring and a huge facility, paid for by the taxpayer to provide enhanced services, is being turned into a storage facility for hospital records. That is an extraordinary way to deal with a new hospital.</P>
    <P>Amidst all this chaos, the Minister for Health and Children seems to be in a condition of political paralysis as he views the possibility of industrial action by eight doctors serving the BTSB which creates the risk of the entire blood service closing down within days.  I have publicly called on the doctors involved and the BTSB to use the industrial relations mechanisms that are available to resolve that dispute.  Apparently the BTSB is refusing to talk to the IMO which represents the doctors.  An utter scandal is taking place at a time when the BTSB is trying to restore public confidence in its operation.  The BTSB should actively seek to use the industrial dispute mechanisms available, not deal with this issue in a head-on confrontation with medical officers on whom it is dependent to provide a service.</P>
    <P>The first 11 months of this Government in office have been a health service disaster for patients who are our primary concern as health service consumers.  Sadly, to date, the two Government parties have betrayed the many promises made by them to the electorate at the last election.  I could detail those to a greater degree than I have time for this evening.  I am merely touching on areas that deserve to be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall correctly referred to failures in the area of mental handicap.  The Government's record in that area is a national disgrace.</P>

      <P>The Government is not coming to terms with the need not only for day care and residential care but the need to provide proper respite care for elderly parents who are at the end of their tether looking after mentally handicapped adult children.  There is a broad spectrum <Col N="464" /> of issues with which this Government is not coming to terms.</P>
      <P>We hear much about the Celtic tiger.  As this country advances economically, those who are less economically fortunate are entitled to look to Government to provide for them a full and comprehensive health service so that they know that if they need health care, it is available to them.  It is unacceptable that there are waiting lists of this order.  According to the waiting lists of last December, there are 1,370 people awaiting cardiac surgery.  In the cardiology area, there are 1,299 awaiting services and in gynaecology, there are 2,216.  These lists are growing steadily.  We do not know their levels today.  It is simply not good enough from the European country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share the remaining time with my colleague, Deputy Ring.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Labour Party in bringing forward this motion.  It allows us the opportunity to give an early progress report on the state of the Government's health policy.  I concede that, with the Government not even 12 months in power, it would be unfair to condemn it too strongly.  However, I concur with what Deputy Shatter said about many of the promises made and many of the promises in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  We have yet to see the commencement of many of those proposals.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State Deputy Moffatt has responsibility with regard to health care for the elderly, I will briefly refer to some of the problems in that area and some of the issues which need to be addressed.  On the lack of beds, both at nursing home and geriatric levels, in almost every health board region even with the relative success of the nursing home subvention scheme, people are finding it impossible to find approved nursing home beds.  There is a need for an initiative at State level by way of investment in geriatric and district hospitals.  We also need an initiative to ensure that further private beds are available.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the nursing home subvention scheme is made more attractive.  The present maximum rate of subvention of £120 per week is the rate allowed when the scheme was introduced. Nursing home costs and the weekly cost to the patient have increased substantially since and the rate of subvention must be increased accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advance of next year's budget the Minister should discuss the carer's allowance scheme with his colleague in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It is a valuable <Col N="465" /> scheme.  It has resulted in many people, who otherwise would have to seek permanent hospital care, being able to remain in the comfort of their homes.  The means testing and the methodology used to determine a person's eligibility or otherwise must be reviewed.  It would be an economically sound Government policy to redefine the scheme and make it more possible for people to claim that allowance.</P>
    <P>The two health insurance companies recently indicated that they may seek a redefinition of community rating to allow an extra charge to be levied on elderly people who wish to join health insurance for the first time.  I am disappointed the Minister did not indicate immediately that the Government would not concede to such a proposal. The Government, and the Minister of State Deputy Moffatt, as the Minister with responsibility for care for the elderly, needs to say publicly, clearly and quickly that community rating in its broadest sense will be retained and that no elderly people who wish to join health insurance companies for the first time will be penalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the 1988 document The Years Ahead.  That document has not been implemented to any great extent.  It needs to be updated and put into operation.  I hope we will have further opportunities, both at the Select Committee on Health and Children and at Question Time, to address that.  That document was meant to give hope and confidence to the rapidly growing population of elderly.  We need to see action stemming from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with my colleague Deputy Shatter when he said we could create a two-tier system.  We have a two-tier system.  With this system, money speaks all languages.  If a person has the money, he or she can have a hip, eye or heart operation done in the next three weeks.  If a person has a medical card and is waiting for health services, he or she could wait up to a couple of years.  I can prove that.  A constituent of mine was waiting for an MRI scan which was to be done in October.  I wrote to Beaumont Hospital to see when he could be taken as a private patient and received a letter in reply stating he could be dealt with in April.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, is present.  I am sorry that Deputy Fahey is not here because he is the man who has responsibility for children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to a health board official about a constituent and received a reply stating that the matter would take 22 months.  I wrote to him a month <Col N="466" /> later and the waiting time had increased to 24 months.  Then the smart Alec wrote to me to say that statistics have proven that one could receive orthodontic service up to the age of 85.  It is fine for him; he will have a pension when he retires and his salary on a Friday evening.  It was a disgraceful remark from a health board official.  He forgot that the people might be dead before they reached 85.  He is used to sending out appointments to people who are dead and has caused great upset and distress to families as a result.  If he wants a job with RTE, I am sure they will fix him up with one because there is a shortage of comics.  He is not doing too well in the health board with the waiting list.</P>

If they have a few pounds saved, the health board will not allow them home help.  That is the case since the Minister came into office.  I want him to deal with that problem.

The biggest outcry in my constituency and in the Western Health Board area generally is in relation to the orthodontic service.  Children are having their teeth examined and told that they will be sent for in three or four years' time.  That is not good enough.  Families cannot afford to get private treatment.  That is what the Minister wants them to do, but they cannot do that because they do not have the money.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Army Short-Term Contracts.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this very important and urgent matter.  It has emerged from recent newspaper reports that regulations to allow for the recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces of FCA personnel on short-term contracts has been drafted.  This initiative has been undertaken without consultation with PDFORRA or RACO and has caused a large degree of concern among members of the Permanent Defence Forces and the FCA.  The proposal as outlined in media reports is that FCA personnel would be recruited into the Defence Forces on a short-term 18-months contract, that FCA members would have to resign from the reserve force to avail of this option, and that the intention is to use these personnel to fulfil specialist positions overseas as drivers, engineers and medical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal raises two very important issues. First, there is the nature of the proposal itself and its implications for the Defence Forces.  Second, there is the wider question of a partnership approach to change within the Defence Forces and the manner in which this proposal has ignored that approach.  There are many operational and contractual problems associated with this plan.  If the Minister considers it a quick-fix <Col N="468" /> solution to the staffing problems of units serving overseas, he is sadly mistaken.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to recruit FCA members on 18-month contracts.  An overseas trip involves a six-months tour of duty and a one-month leave period. That leaves a maximum of nine months for training recruits.  Many Army personnel do not believe this to be adequate to prepare a recruit for service overseas.  As it stands, it takes five and a half months to train a recruit to basic threestar private standard.  It is desirable that overseas personnel undertake additional training courses such as weapons courses and have between six and 12 months operational experience before they serve overseas.  This is not possible in the timeframe proposed, and is a serious flaw.</P>
    <P>Maturity, experience and a cool head are essential for personnel serving overseas.  Our Defence Forces personnel have to fit into a totally foreign political, cultural, military and social system such as exists in the Lebanon.  It is totally inappropriate to expect new Permanent Defence Forces recruits with a minimum level of training to assimilate into this scenario.  It is not in the best interests of the Army or of the communities we serve overseas to pursue this course of action.  It is not acceptable to use sticking plaster measures in such sensitive environments where the safety and well-being of our troops must be a priority.</P>
    <P>This proposal also has serious implications for the terms of employment under which our Defence Forces operate.  Effectively, we are introducing short-term contracts into the service and providing no career structure for those members of the FCA who may want to apply for the posts.  Under the proposal, FCA members must also resign from the reserve force to take up these posts.  Has any thought been given to the effect it would have on a reserve force if a large number of key personnel were to leave it within a short period?</P>
    <P>There is also a large degree of concern among ordinary rank and file Army personnel that this plan, rather than attempting to overcome personnel shortages, is actually designed to introduce short-term contracts by the back door.  Many members of the Defence Forces are concerned that if this measure is introduced, the principle of short-term contracts will be established within the Army and will be employed to a greater extent in the future.  I wish to stress the concerns expressed to me by Army personnel about this, going beyond their own personal situation.  There is a serious concern about the overall effect of such a policy on the Defence Forces, and members of the Defence Forces want this matter clarified as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>As well as these serious contractual and logistical matters, this whole plan and the manner in which it has been handled by the Department gives serious cause for concern.  The concept of partnership and consultation, which forms the backbone of a recent employment relations policy, has been ignored in this case and this is a serious error.  It has increased the amount of suspicion <Col N="469" /> regarding the real motives behind this proposal and has had an effect on morale in both the reserve force, who argue for the extension of overseas experience for the FCA proper, and in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister outlines Government policy on this matter.  He must explain where he, as Minister for Defence, stands on the issue and why this proposal proceeded without consultation.  He must outline the effects the implementation of this proposal will have on both the FCA and the Permanent Defence Forces. He must outline his recruitment plans for the Permanent Defence Forces that will remove the need to recruit personnel on short-term contracts to fill key posts overseas.  Our Defence Forces personnel at all levels deserve this degree of accountability from the Minister.  He must put all the facts on the table and tell this House where the proposal now stands.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, and to clarify in precise terms the position regarding the possibility of FCA personnel serving overseas, in particular with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>This issue is in the very early stages of consideration. No firm proposals have been finalised and detailed consideration has only begun. However, because of one public comment by an unnamed source, various groups feel obliged to attack or defend a policy which has not yet been formulated even in the broadest terms.  As of now, there is no official position on the issue, it is simply being examined.</P>
      <P>Preliminary consideration is being given to allowing members of the second line reserve to serve overseas with units of the Permanent Defence Forces.  These considerations are at a very early stage and what is being examined are the advantages and disadvantages of such a scheme, the mechanisms by how it might work, and the difficulties that may arise from an organisational or an individual point of view.  In particular what is being discussed is the use of FCA personnel with certain skills, such as paramedics or cooks, to fill certain appointments overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision has been taken as to whether these personnel should remain members of the FCA or enlist in the Permanent Defence Forces.  No view has been taken as to the length of time they would serve overseas.  However, when proposals have been formulated I will give them serious consideration.  Any decision will be made in the best interests of the Defence Forces and the State.  When the review of the proposal has been completed, all interested parties, including representative associations, will be consulted should any change in the present situation be recommended. <Col N="470" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious situation has arisen in nurseries in the Eastern Health Board region which has led to all parents of children attending them receiving a letter annoucing a nursery school strike on 20 May.  This strike is threatening 20 day nurseries in the greater Dublin area funded by the Eastern Health Board which provide day care for many children.  I will quote from a parent's letter to me:</P>
      <P>The nursery teachers have provided a vital service to me and my child and have shown themselves to be extremely dedicated.  I could never have gone back to study or work and become independent of the social welfare system without the help of a nursery.</P>
      <P>Many parents have echoed these thoughts.</P>
      <P>The staff and their unions have had long negotiations with the health board.  They also had an independent inquiry and a Labour Court recommendation in October 1997.  Can the Minister give a reason for such a long delay and lengthy negotiations?  The health board refused to accede to the Labour Court recommendation, hence the threatened strike in the last few weeks.  This has led to distress among parents and staff and has meant that a huge amount of attention has been taken from other tasks because so much energy has been spent on this issue.</P>
      <P>It appears that at the 11th hour a commitment was given to IMPACT to resolve the situation.  I am raising this issue as, although providing high quality care to pre-school children receives a great deal of lip service, the reality is that staff in the sector have been underpaid for many years. The efforts which IMPACT and these workers had to make to get a Labour Court recommendation accepted by the statutory body proves the point and this is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Pay rates for nursery staff start at £8,500 per annum and rise to a maximum of £10,300 after ten years' service.  That is for people with a two year diploma.  The recent report of the Commission on the Family highlighted the urgent need for high quality, pre-school care, particularly for more disadvantaged children.  If this report is to mean anything lessons must be learned from the situation I have highlighted.  The Government must give a new commitment that nursery care will be available and affordable and that staff will be properly paid.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I understand that the board is making arrangements to provide the necessary funding to the management committee of the relevant day nurseries in the region to enable them to implement in full Labour Court recommendation No. 15671.  I am pleased that on foot of this, IMPACT has advised the board that the industrial action scheduled for Wednesday, 27 May will <Col N="471" /> be deferred and the offer will be put to members with a recommendation for acceptance.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House I would like to take the opportunity to explain the background to the situation.  Under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, health boards make financial contributions to a wide variety of organisations. Examples of the type of organisation supported in this way would include bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the meals on wheels service and a range of other bodies in the general welfare area including organisations staffed by volunteers.</P>
      <P>Under this Act health boards make contributions to certain pre-school services which cater for children regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Specifically, the Eastern Health Board as part of its child care services makes a contribution via the section 65 mechanism to day care nurseries in the region.</P>
      <P>These nurseries operate autonomously and are independent of the board in their day-to-day operation.  The employees of organisations in receipt of section 65 grants from health boards are not employees of the boards and, accordingly, the health boards do not directly determine their rates of pay and conditions.  In matters of recruitment, pay rates and conditions of employment, the arrangements agreed between the employer and employee are not subject to control by the local health board or the Department.</P>
      <P>Labour Court recommendation No. 15671 refers to the pay of 20 day nursery managers and 100 other staff employed in approximately 100 day care centres in the greater Dublin area and, therefore, relates to the Eastern Health Board area specifically.  The recommendation makes provision for the revision of salary for these staff in line with the Department of Education and Science's &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the award is a matter for the management of the day nurseries as the direct employer in consultation with the health board about funding and service levels.  The Eastern Health Board has to consider the implications of claims such as this in the context of its overall funding of child care services within the board. Because of the nature of the service and the demand for such a service in the Dublin area the board decided to protect the existing level of services by increasing the grant aid to cover the increased cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 May the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> declared that the debate on this issue was only warming up.  The experience in my constituency, Dublin North, shows the devastation which threatens Irish horticulture.  Other communities <Col N="472" /> in which transnational retail giants have taken hold report the death of city and town centre trade, the strangulation of indigenous suppliers, the creation of unemployment and throwing off kilter of sensitive urban development.  They also encourage the greater use of chemicals in agriculture to prolong the shelf life of products at the expense of the health of farm workers and customers. Why?</P>
      <P>The answer is that transnational retail giants are, by and large, plcs and their aim is to maximise shareholder value.  This requires them to put the squeeze on supplier margins, staff pay and conditions and, ultimately, consumer costs.  Plcs operate in local economies to extract wealth.  The purpose of the small trader or family grocer is to maintain a livelihood as an integral, endogenous part of the community.</P>
      <P>Multinational retailers compartmentalise expertise.  Local traders are all rounders and are more tuned in to the needs of the community. When a multinational superstore opens small traders are affected through moving from self-employment, through the squeeze on their margins as a result of economies of scale, into the employment of the superstore.  The local economy loses diversity, flexibility and durability and the fruits of that person's efforts are extracted as plc shareholder value rather than being available for reinvestment locally.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention a couple of organisations which are trying to upset this trend.  The SEDA Ireland initiative promotes sustainable enterprise through providing mutual guarantee facilities to members.  This should be encouraged and I would like to praise its efforts in the face of huge odds.  The MARC action research project in the Roscommon-Mayo area is an alliance of small business interests at community level and it needs to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand plcs tend to externalise or export the collateral damage.  Their means of operating rely upon child labour, environmental despoliation, and, in some cases, collusion with despots.  This is done out of sight in another jurisdiction and often in another hemisphere.  The Government needs to take action.  Even some of the most committed free market economies in Europe have taken decisive action in the face of this growing trend.  Britain has planning restrictions favouring city centre development.  Spain and Portugal have capped the maximum size of new shopping centres.  In France, which used to be synonymous with hypermarkets, supermarket developments over 3,000 square feet require the approval of the regional government.  Larger stores require the approval of the national Government.  A public inquiry has be held to determine what impact they will have on the local economy and environment and to prove that they will not destroy more jobs than they will create. I could cite many towns throughout the country as examples.  Where there were once five or six butchers now there is none following the opening of a large supermarket which may employ one or <Col N="473" /> two butchers.  Because the conditions of employment will not be to their liking, having run a family business for generations, these people will leave and look for alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot sit back and act as an observer.  Even in the most committed free market economies in Europe a hands on and proactive approach is adopted to ensure businesses which have been sustained for generations continue to operate and local communities remain vibrant.  I ask the Minister of State to adopt a similar approach here.</P>

      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Teachta as ucht an cheist thábhachtach seo a tharraingt anuas.  Is féidir liom a chur in iúl don Teach go ndéanfear cinneadh ar an gceist seo go luath.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, regrets that, due to other official business, he is unable to be present.  He has asked me to thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and to explain the position on retail shopping development under the planning system.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, planning law provides that decisions to grant or refuse planning permission are made by the relevant planning authority and An Bord Pleanála as an independent body in the event of an appeal.  In making its decision on a planning application, a planning authority must take into consideration several factors.  It must have regard to the proper planning and development of the area in question, the development plan and any submissions or observations made on the application for permission. In the exercise of their planning function the authority and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to any general directives in relation to planning and development issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) General Policy Directive, 1982, sets out considerations which should guide planning authorities in connection with the consideration of applications for planning permission for the establishment of retail shopping development which would represent a large scale addition to existing retail shopping capacity in a locality.  The directive provides that consideration should be given to the adequacy of existing retail shopping outlets; the size and location of existing retail shopping outlets; the quality and convenience of existing retail shopping outlets; the effect on existing communities, including in particular the effect on established retail shopping outlets and employment; the needs of elderly, infirm or disabled persons and other persons who may be dependent on the availability of local retail shopping outlets and the need to counter urban decline and to promote urban renewal and the <Col N="474" /> utilisation of unused infrastructure facilities in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently received representations from a number of sources expressing concern about the possible impacts of the growing trend towards large scale retail developments on the outskirts of towns and cities and the adequacy of the existing policy directive to deal with the planning and development aspects of this trend. He is considering all aspects of the matter in some detail and will bear in mind the Deputy's views in deciding what the best course of action might be.  He hopes to be in a position to give a decision in the matter shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf and that of my constituents of Sligo-Leitrim, I extend my deepest sympathy to the bereaved families of Tommy Coyle, Michael Higgins and Bobby Taylor.  It is a terrible cross to bear to lose a child in such tragic circumstances.  The entire community is in a state of shock and grief and our hearts go out to the families involved.  I am pleased to say that Laurence Cook will make a full recovery.  We must consider what lessons can be learned from this terrible tragedy to ensure there is no repeat.</P>
      <P>There is no information available on dangerous beaches.  A detailed register should be available and circulated widely in all tourism areas, particularly through schools highlighting the dangers of the coastline.  The National Safety Council only responds when a local authority requests a safety survey of a beach, the report on which is classified as confidential.  This is wrong.  Reports should be published and surveys conducted frequently and independently.</P>
      <P>What is required at Strandhill beach where it is not safe to swim but which has been used by the people of south Sligo for the past 70 years is a beach patrol.  The necessary resources should be made available to fund the provision of coastline patrol and lifeboat services.  This is essential.</P>
      <P>A national policy on the management of dangerous beaches has to be established with consistent guidelines.  It is my information that the guidelines vary throughout the country.  Each local authority has its own policy.  When it comes to safety and the protection of life there should be a consistent policy throughout the country.  On average, 195 people lose their lives each year in drowning tragedies.</P>
      <P>We must highlight the dangers of the coastline, regardless of cost.  I call for an independent survey of Strandhill beach.  When a beach is declared unsafe by the National Safety Council relevant safety procedures should be implemented immediately.  When lifeguards were removed at Strandhill they should have been replaced by a beach patrol.  It is neither moral nor appropriate to declare a beach unsafe and then remove all safety services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities need help.  The necessary resources should be made available to Sligo <Col N="475" /> County Council to fund the immediate appointment of beachguards.  Is it appropriate that lifeguards are only appointed in certain areas in July?  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>For County Sligo 17 May was a black day.  The greatest tribute we can pay to the memory of Tommy Coyle, Michael Higgins and Bobby Taylor is to ensure no more lives are lost.  They were three outstanding teenagers who were due to sit the leaving certificate in a few weeks time. The community, but more particularly their families, will never forget this tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy Perry said and join in the vote of sympathy to the Coyle, Higgins and Taylor families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputies' interest in this very important matter and I thank them for this opportunity to set out the position.  I convey my condolences to the families, relatives and friends of the three young men who lost their lives in the tragic accident at Strandhill.  Their loss will be felt for a long time by their communities in which they played such an active part.</P>
      <P>In the context of examining any measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of future similar accidents, a comprehensive report was sought from Sligo County Council.  Preliminary information has been received and a full report is to be submitted within the next week or so, as information becomes available to the local authority.  The National Safety Council will be asked to examine this report and, in its advisory capacity, to provide its observations.  The Department has also arranged an urgent meeting with the National Safety Council for later this week to discuss more general issues which have been highlighted by the tragedy, such as lifeguarding and the availability to the public of information on unsafe beaches, including the location of adequate warning signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of water safety is a matter for the local authorities and the National Safety Council.  The role of the local authorities includes <Col N="476" /> making by-laws for the regulation of bathing places, the employment of life guards, the provision of equipment and appliances for life saving and arranging for instruction in swimming and life saving.  The National Safety Council actively promotes the dissemination of information on water safety, liaises with the Department of Education and Science on water safety matters for school children, issues guidelines for local authorities on water safety matters and, through local committees, organises and supports swimming, life saving and resuscitation courses.  Some idea of the scale of their activity in this area can be got from the fact that more than 80,000 certificates were awarded to people who attended such courses in 1996.  Water safety classes and courses are organised by the water safety committees around the country in response to local interest and demand.  The numbers participating grow each year which is a clear indication of increasing interest and involvement.</P>
    <P>Marine and water based leisure activities are on the increase which can mean there is a greater risk of drowning tragedies.  It may not be possible to prevent all accidents, but we must do everything we can to reduce the number to the absolute minimum.  The inter-relationships between people and water is a complex and varied one.  It can be recreational or occupational.  It can take place on rivers, lakes, on the beach or further out at sea.  There are many people and organisations, some full-time and others voluntary, who are dedicated to saving lives and promoting greater awareness of the dangers of water.  The review process, which is being initiated, will aim to make the optimum arrangements for using all the resources that are available to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of what happened at Strandhill.  The major review of water safety matters is being carried out with a view to strengthening and reorganising existing structures and I expect to make decisions regarding these matters in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 28, 44, 49, 83, 95, 99 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputies' attention to my reply to the question from Deputy Broughan in which I outlined the overall strategic approach to be pursued by Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should stress again that Enterprise Ireland will be a new organisation with a new mission and culture and not a simple amalgamation of its component <Col N="478" /> parts.  I have already outlined the implications of this approach for the schemes and operations of Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and FÁS in my reply to Deputy Broughan's question. I am anxious that the agency should commence operations as soon as possible and I therefore propose to introduce the necessary enabling legislation during the month of June.</P>
    <P>As regards Forbairt's scientific and research facilities, my overriding concern is to ensure that Enterprise Ireland is in a position to play a strong development role in research and development. Enterprise Ireland will draw on both the existing resources within Forbairt itself and linkages with the third level colleges to achieve this.</P>
    <P>In a similar vein, Enterprise Ireland will have strong function in regard to exports, and growth in sales and exports among client firms will be a central performance criterion for the new agency. Enterprise Ireland will continue to provide market information and other relevant services on a demand-led basis to firms which need and are prepared to avail of them.</P>
    <P>My objective is to ensure that the board of the new agency will provide the strategic direction required to ensure that the agency fulfills its mission of assisting client firms to develop a sustainable competitive advantage and thus expand profitable sales, boost exports and excrease employment.  I am currently considering the composition of the board in that regard.</P>
    <P>The agency's role in relation to small business will align with its overall mission, that is, the agency will assist firms to become more competitive and ensure that small businesses become bigger businesses.  Enterprise Ireland will avoid unnecessary duplication and overlaps with the county enterprise boards and other agencies in dealing with very small companies by focusing on those start-up and small companies which have high growth potential.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 35, 124 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in replies to earlier parliamentary questions on the matter, the difficulties on the employment front associated with the growing practice of Sunday trading have been the subject of a discussion process between IBEC and trade union interests, including the unions primarily concerned, SIPTU and MANDATE, under an agreed independent chairman.  This process was set in motion in January last by me in the hope and belief that a partnership approach would succeed in resolving the difficulties to the mutual satisfaction of both sides without the need for recourse to legislation.</P>
      <P>Last week I received a report from the independent chairman on the outcome of the discussion process.  This report indicates that the parties involved accepted that a code of practice along lines proposed by the chairman could, without prejudicing the fundamental position of either side, form the basis of a common and voluntary approach to practice in relation to retail sector Sunday working.</P>
      <P>I am disposed to accepting the report and propose to request the Labour Relations Commission, pursuant to section 35(2) of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, to prepare a code of practice on Sunday working in the retail trade.  I have now written to ICTU and IBEC advising them of my intention and seeking confirmation of their acceptance that this approach is the best way forward in seeking a solution to this problem.</P>

      <P>The total number of workers in employment is 1.338 million.  My Department has no statistics on the number of contract workers as distinct from permanent full-time employees.  The term contract worker may be interpreted as referring to a number of different categories of workers, some of which are employees and some of which are self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, employees, that is persons who are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, <Col N="480" /> including persons employed on fixed-term or fixed-purpose contracts come within the scope of employment protection legislation.  The self-employed, that is persons working under a contract for services do not come within the scope of employment legislation as they are not employees.</P>
    <P>Contract workers, whether self-employed or employed on fixed-term or fixed-purpose contracts, are a valuable asset to the economy where such work fulfils the wishes of both employers and employees to have flexible working arrangements. I am also aware, however, that a small minority of employers resort to such forms of working arrangements as a deliberate means of depriving their workers of their entitlement to certain protections under employment legislation and I would condemn this practice.</P>
    <P>I understand, that, in the context of the Agreement on Social Policy annexed to the Treaty on European Union, consultations between the social partners at European level commenced in March last with a view to negotiating an agreement on fixed-term employment contracts.  In the event of these negotiations leading to an agreement, such agreement may be implemented at Community level by a collective agreement, or, at the joint request of the signatory parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission. The possible introduction of legislation in this country on this issue will be considered in the light of developments at that stage.</P>

My Department continues to collaborate with the Department of Public Enterprise, other relevant <Col N="481" /> Departments and the industrial development agencies in an ongoing effort to enhance the contribution of telecommunications services to the competitiveness of Ireland and Irish business.</P>
    <P>Of course, the announcement by the Government of the decision to end Telecom Éireann's monopoly on voice telephony by the end of this year or one year ahead of schedule will contribute significantly to the development of a fully competitive telecommunications market in this country and will lead to benefits in terms of quality of service and reduced costs.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for bank charges under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, that he has had discussions with the representative bodies of the financial services industry regarding their changeover plans for the euro.  These bodies have made the case that there will be residual costs for financial institutions when the euro is being introduced despite the elimination of the exchange rate risk.</P>
      <P>The director has indicated that it will be a matter for individual institutions to make their case to him under section 149 of the Act.  He has received assurances, however, that the benefits of the single currency will be passed on to consunmers, including businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date no applications pertaining to the euro have been submitted to the Director for his consideration. <Col N="482" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 77, 100, and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that this Government is fully committed to continue funding for research activities.</P>
      <P>In relation to the funding position for the National Research Support Fund Board which is attached to my responsibilities in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the position is that the allocation to this board has increased from £7.5 million to £8.5 million over the period 1996 to 1998, which represents an increase of 17 per cent.  Out of this amount, an allocation of around £2 million per annum has been allocated for basic research, over the same period.</P>
      <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that in 1998, for the first time, this Government has provided substantial dedicated funding for research and development, through the Department of Education and Science.  This new allocation of £5 million has been included in the 1998 Estimate, for the Department of Education and Science for recurrent funding of research and development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My appointment in the two Departments ensures that there is effective co-ordination of science and technology issues and there is also ongoing contact at official level.  In addition the inter-departmental committee on science, technology <Col N="483" /> and innovation, chaired by me, which was established pursuant to the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation, provides an effective mechanism for consideration of science and technology priorities, between all of the Departments, involved in funding science and technology.  A permanent independent advisory body, The Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, which was also recommended in the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation has been set up and this has proved to be a very valuable source of advice, on a range of issues.  In addition Forfás has played a major role in the provision of policy advice and co-ordination, as well as promoting science and technology, for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>These co-ordination mechanisms are designed to ensure, that we continue to strengthen our research base, both to promote the development of indigenous industry and to help increase the level of R&amp;D activity in foreign owned firms located here.</P>
    <P>This allocation, is additional to previous research and development allocations and does not imply any reduction in existing expenditure. It is envisaged that the funding will be available for research and development in science and technology, the humanities and the social sciences.  The Higher Education Authority has been asked to develop proposals for this expenditure and building on this process, I will shortly make a detailed announcement, on the mechanisms, that have been put in place, for the expenditure on science and technology.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the demand for further funding for new projects, in the basic research area and have received a number of representations on this issue.  In this regard, therefore, I will allocate £0.5 million this year, from this sum of £5 million for new basic research projects.  The mechanism for this extra funding will be through the Higher Education Authority process.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of overall co-ordination regarding the allocation of research funds, I am satisfied with the mechanisms in place to ensure that funds are disbursed effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise. Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 36, 46, 56, 57, 60, 64, 86, 97 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's Employment Action Plan which we submitted to the European Commission in April of this year sets out the policy measures and steps being taken at national level to give effect to the objectives of the four pillars and the 19 guidelines in the Council Resolution of <Col N="485" /> December 1997.  Many of the policy prescriptions proposed under the EU guidelines are already in place here so to that extent the guidelines will serve to reinforce national effort.</P>
    <P>The guidelines call for the adoption of a preventative strategy whereby there will be early intervention with all young and adult unemployed, within six and 12 months respectively of their becoming unemployed with a view to offering them a job or other employability support.</P>
    <P>We propose to meet this commitment by focusing initially on the under 25's who cross the six month unemployment threshold, and providing support for them to enter or re-enter the jobs market, as called for under the guidelines.</P>
    <P>This will be done by means of co-operation beween the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, the FÁS employment services, and utilising also the services available from the local employment service.</P>
    <P>The process will be modelled generally, on the youth progression programme introduced for 18 and 19 year olds in October 1996.  A first evaluation of that programme is that it increased the rate of exit of 18 and 19 year olds from the live register by some 20 percentage points, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The specific costs of the proposals in relation to young long-term unemployed is not readily identifiable.  However, the overall financial provision available for the employablility pillar of the guidelines, under which this particular initiative falls is just under £900 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of specific new job creation initiatives, I would point out that the plan is primarily an articulation of labour market policy which is concerned with mobilising labour supply and creating the conditions in which people can get back into work.  The entrepreneurship pillar is however specifically concerned with creating the conditions in which new jobs, particularly in the SME domain, can emerge.  The range of measures proposed relate areas of administrative burdens, addressing tax obstacles to self-employment and the setting up of small businesses, reducing the overall tax burden including that impacting on direct and indirect labour costs, and assessing the potential of the social economy to generate new jobs.  The plan embodies a comprehensive set of measures to deal with long-term unemployment.  I would refer, in particular, to the key initiative to be launched by FÁS later this year in the form of an action programme for the long-term unemployed in which it will commit itself publicly to specific targets of increasing the proportion of long-term unemployed persons accessing training programmes.</P>
    <P>As regards second level students who exit early from the school system and programmes, the action plan provides for £26 million for measures aimed at capacity expansion of at least 1,000 extra places in Youthreach and traveller training centres, an increase of progression places in FÁS to a total of 2,200, and an investment in preventive, <Col N="486" /> counselling, guidance and psychological services for persons at risk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 55 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Financial provision for the local employment service, including its special education and training fund, is made in my Department's Estimate which I am satisfied will be adequate to meet any expansion needs this year.  Such provision does not arise in connection with the Finance Bill which is primarily concerned with the implementation of various tax changes.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for my Department for 1998 provide for the expansion of the local employment service to a number of new areas this year and my officials are currently assessing which areas could be included in this year's expansion phase.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness contains a commitment to the phased expansion of the LES initially to areas of concentrated unemployment, such that the LES will have commenced in all designated partneship areas during the period of this Partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's recent Employment Action Plan includes a commitment to strengthen the employment services function and states that organisational issues relating to the roles of the various strands of the employment service currently operating, particularly the FÁS employment service and the local employment service, as well as the inter-relationship between the employment service and the welfare support administration are to be resolved during 1998. <Col N="487" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 38, 139 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed to hear, earlier this year that despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland and Telecom Éireann, Microsoft had decided not to relocate their European Internet &ldquo;Mirror Site&rdquo; in Ireland.  Forfás, the IDA and my Department have made soundings of major users of advanced telecoms services, including Microsoft and other e-comerce or Internet related services, to establish their concerns and perceptions of Ireland.  It emerged that there were perceptions that real competitive conditions were not seen to exist in the Irish telecommunications market.  These perceptions, notwithstanding the fact that the derogation that has now been rescinded, only applied to voice telephony.  It did not apply to data.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, major operators did not perceive the Irish market as being a modern regulatory and friendly environment for telecommunications investment.  There was a concern that Ireland did not offer all the necessary peering arrangements for business operators.  Peering is the complex software and contractual arrangement whereby Internet service provider companies inter-relate to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement by the Government this week of the decision to end Telecom Éireann's monopoly on voice telephony by the end of this year or one year ahead of schedule will go a long way towards removing any negative perception of Ireland from a regulatory standpoint.  The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland will have open competitive conditions in all aspects of the telecommunications business in order to attract the variety of international players so vital for future success in the age of rapidly increasing electronic commerce.  My Department continues to collaborate with the Department of Public Enterprise, other relevant Departments <Col N="488" /> and the industrial development agencies in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last January I authorised Mr. Gerard Ryan, an officer of my Department, to exmine the books and documents of four companies under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.  The companies involved are Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd, Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Ltd, Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd.  and Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd.  His investigations are making significant progress.  A significant amount of new and relevant documentation received from Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Ltd.  and Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd.  is being examined, together with a smaller amount of Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd.  material.</P>
      <P>While Mr. Ryan has been denied the books and documents of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., the papers of Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Ltd.  and Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd.  contain correspondence and other information relating to the business of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd.  in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that Mr. Ryan is seeking to uncover clandestine activity in the State spanning a period in some cases of more than 20 years, the Deputy will appreciate that this task will take time.  I expect that it will be a number of months before Mr. Ryan can substantially complete his inquiries.</P>
      <P>On 27 April last, Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd initiated legal proceedings in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands against Mr. Ryan and me. Although I am precluded by Order of the Grand Court from disclosing the content of the proceedings or of any affidavits lodged in the court, I am pleased that the court decided that it did not have the jurisdiction to grant the order sought by Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd.  which would have prohibited the disclosure of Ansbacher books and documents to Mr. Ryan.  I will be happy to forward to any Deputy, on request, a copy of the lengthy reasoned decision of the court, which is not covered by the terms of the Grand Court Order.  I have no information at this stage as to whether or not Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd.  will be appealing this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am absolutely determined that Mr. Ryan should complete his inquiries, and I will assist him in doing so by seeking, through all available legal means, retrieval of the Ansbacher documents <Col N="489" /> which should continue to be available to him here for examination.  I am at a loss to understand how Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., which is owned by reputable banking concerns, can continue to stand over the banking and corporate practices revealed in the McCracken tribunal report.  Its attempt in recent weeks to get the Grand Court in the Cayman Islands to give its previous actions legal protection and a veneer of respectability has rightly been thrown out.  Even at this late stage, I would urge Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd.  and its parent banks to reconsider their stance of non co-operation with Mr. Ryan's legitimate inquiries into Ansbacher's past activity in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 87 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The electronics sector represents the most important growth sector for industrial development in Ireland and has strong potential for the future as technological developments continue and electronic products become even more pervasive. Our policy objective is to harness this growth potential for Ireland in high skilled and high value added segments of the business.</P>
      <P>However, in the electronics industry change is constant, therefore all segments of the industry are kept under continuous review by my Department, the industrial development agencies and Forfás in conjunction with outside analysts.</P>
      <P>The perspectives gained from these ongoing reviews and also the contact with independent industry analysts and leading industrialists make an important contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the strategy for the development <Col N="490" /> of the electronics sector is built around targeting particular niches that provide the best potential for Ireland.  We aim to maintain a competitive operating environment and to compete for investments across a broad range of selected key segments. We are also focusing on increasing the embeddedness of companies in Ireland against a background of continuous change in technology and customer requirements.</P>
    <P>The increased availability of a well educated workforce with relevant skills is fundamental to the development of the sector and significant steps have been taken by the Government to address the skills needs of the sector.</P>
    <P>The development of our indigenous electronics industry is key policy objective.  The sector is experiencing dynamic growth in a wide range of segments.  Many of these companies are successfully becoming niche players and are at the leading edge developing the very latest state-of-the-art technologies.</P>
    <P>Given the constant change and volatility of the electronics sector, I am satisfied the strategy of a systematic and continuous assessment for the development of the sector is the correct approach.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 68 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently approved EU Biotechnology Inventions Directive aims to clarify and harmonise biotechnology patent practice in Europe by establishing clear parameters defining which biotechnological inventions are, and are not, patentable.  The directive seeks to encourage more European companies to invest strategically in their patent portfolios thereby creating a more <Col N="492" /> solid basis on which companies employing biotechnology can flourish.  Patent protection is fundamental to the growth of R&amp;D based bioindustries. They provide essential protection for new innovative biotech products and processes which in turn encourage entrepreneurship and generate new commercial opportunities as well as jobs.  The EU directive will allow Europe compete more favorably with USA and Japan in global markets in the development and exploitation of biotechnology.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by Bio Research Ireland, which was established in 1988 as part of Forbairt and has a major role in the development and commercialisation of biotechnology inventions, that the effect of the biotechnology inventions directive on the Irish biotechnology industry will in the short-term be modest.  The directive clarifies the scope of patentability of certain biotechnology based inventions and as yet Ireland's biotechnology industry is not a major player in originating new patentable technologies in these areas.  However, Irish biotechnology companies which do have such patents or who are working towards developing patent portfolios will benefit from the EU directive in that the directive will result in a significant easing of the administrative burden attaching to the protection of their patents within Europe.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is independent in the performance of his statutory duties, that he has met with the Irish Bankers Federation and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association concerning the changeover to the euro.  These associations have made the point to him that there will be residual costs in their foreign exchange departments despite the elimination of the exchange rate risk as a result of the introduction of the euro.  From January 1999, European currencies will have to be exchanged at the official exchange rate, which means that no spread will be allowed.  Individual institutions will have to make a case justifying any residual costs which remain and these will be considered by the director.  To date he has received no such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The director is anxious to ensure that the benefits of the euro will be passed on to consumers by way of reduced costs in terms of foreign exchange transactions within those states who will have joined the euro club.  In this connection, there will be some savings and these will be passed on.  The extent of these savings will be somewhat curtailed <Col N="493" /> by the lack of harmonisation in the clearing systems throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Any proposals submitted by the financial institutions will be dealt with by the director in accordance with his independent statutory functions under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>Developments in the retail sector arising from the entry of British multiples into the Irish retail market are being closely monitored by my Department.  As I explained in my reply to Deputy Owen's parliamentary question on 26 March last, I have no power to prevent these developments and we must recall that Irish companies have as much right to open business in other member states of the Community as companies from other member states have to open here.  Indeed, this is a right which many Irish firms have exploited very successfully.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive legal framework exists through which anti-competitive behaviour and abuses of dominant position can be challenged. This framework is enforced by the Competition Authority and by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If this legislation is at any time seen as deficient in terms of responding to developments on the retail trade, it can be reviewed to make it more effective.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not believe that any purpose would be served in producing a White Paper at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>On 23 March 1998, Mr. Martin Cosgrove was appointed authorised officer under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, to establish the extent to which the operations of National Irish Bank Ltd. and its associated companies complied with the provisions of the Insurance Acts and associated regulations.  Mr. Cosgrave will submit an interim report within the next ten days.  I will consider this report in conjunction with my legal advisers. Mr. Cosgrove is an officer of my Department and there are no costs associated with his inquiry other than normal departmental salary and overhead costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 March 1998 at my request, Mr. John Blayney and Mr. Tom Grace were appointed by the High Court as inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd.  under secton 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.  The court ordered the inspectors to produce an interim report to it by 22 June next.  I understand <Col N="495" /> that shortly after the appointment, they sought the co-operation of National Irish Bank Ltd., and I am aware that the inspectors have since advertised in the media seeking information from the public which might be of assistance to their inquiries.  As the reporting relationship of the inspectors is to the High Court, I have no other information on the progress of their investigation or on the length of time which it might take.  I expect, however, that the inspectors' interim report will deal with these issues, and it is my intention to be represented at the High Court hearing on 29 June which will consider their report.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990, the cost of a section 8 investigation is borne initially by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, my Department is aware that the inspectors' fees for their first month of work amounted to £54,102.15. There are provisions in section 13 for the court to direct that body corporates dealt with in section 8 reports repay the Minister.</P>

      <P>Fixed-term employment contracts, that is, contracts which either specify a date on which the contract will terminate, or name an event which, when it occurs, will terminate the contract, are normally regarded as an aspect of temporary rather than part-time employment.  Such contracts are not addressed specifically in the EU directive on part-time workers.</P>
      <P>However, in March last consultations between the social partners at European level, in the context of the agreement on social policy annexed to the Treaty on European Union, commenced with a view to negotiating an agreement on fixed-term employment contracts.  Discussions on this issue are continuing.</P>
      <P>In the event of these negotiations being successful, such an agreement may be implemented at Community level by a collective agreement or, at the joint request of the signatory parties, by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission. The possible introduction of legislation in this country on this matter will be considered in the light of developments at that stage.</P>

      <P>Under the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs monitors the display of diesel and petrol price notices, which must provide certain information in a specified manner.  There are no procedures or regulations in force governing the retail price of petrol.  I have not received any allegations of anti-competitive behaviour that might suggest price fixing arrangements in the area of petrol prices.  Any such allegations should be brought to the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement with a request that he investigate the alleged breach or breaches.  The Director of Competition Enforcement can be contacted at the offices of the Competition Authority, Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1. Alternatively, a civil action can be taken under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputies that I gave a very detailed reply to this House on these matters on the 18 February and 26 March last.  The draft life assurance transparency regulations are still under ongoing discussion and development.  Special industry guidance notes are also in the process of being drafted in order to ensure that prospective <Col N="497" /> policyholders are not misled or provided with distorted projections on returns.  It is our intention to ensure that all inclusive and comprehensive disclosure requirements are in operation that will enable insurance policyholders and those proposing to buy life assurance investment products to make an investment decision with full knowledge of all charges, including insurance commissions and comparable salespersons' remuneration, deducted from premium payments.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposed disclosure regime will lead to a re-think by insurers on the traditional practice of upfront loading of life assurance investment policies whereby the bulk of the policyholder's premium payments in the early years is absorbed in commissions and management charges.  I understand that some companies, in anticipating the imposition of increased disclosure requirements, are already beginning to spread such charges over the lifetime of the policy.  Ultimately, increased competition as a consequence of the implementation of the transparency regulations and heightened consumer awareness should lead to a better value for money product. The Competition Authority, which has ruled on the insurance industry's previous maximum commissions agreement as uncompetitive, is of the view that competition between life assurance companies for increased market share will lead to companies offering reduced premiums to the consumer and that this will, in effect, put downward pressure on both distribution and management charges.  The emergence of new products and new methods of distribution for those products will also increase competition in the insurance market.  For all of these reasons, I intend to proceed as quickly as is practicable to have comprehensive transparency regulations put in place in the interests of the consumer and in providing the necessary impetus for increased competition in this very important savings and investment area.</P>

I informed the House on 6 November 1997 that I had asked the review group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry in relation to the regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership.  The work of the review group is, I understand, complex and wideranging and is making steady progress.  I am hopeful that it will report to me later this year.</P>

I would remind the House that the voluntarist approach to industrial relations serves this country well in terms of national and social partnership, industrial relations at workplace level and investment in enterprise and jobs.  Therefore, we must, where necessary and possible, encourage the social partners to continue the development of co-operative industrial relations by dialogue and by the pursuit of a problem-solving approach where this is appropriate.</P>

This draft standard is likely to be adopted as a harmonised European standard in about two years time.  In practice, the Irish Agreement Board certify such pipes as fit for purpose within buildings where they are suitable for both hot and cold services, including hot water radiators.

      <P>Earlier this year I requested IDA Ireland to submit proposals to me for encouraging the employment of greater numbers of disabled people in companies locating in this country.  I understand that IDA Ireland already operates a voluntary code among its overseas sponsored companies by the inclusion of an exhortatory clause in a formal letter which accompanies letter of grant offers to companies. This clause requests companies to give consideration where possible and appropriate to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is currently having in-depth discussions with a small number of overseas client companies with a view to introducing a pilot programme to bring people with disabilities into the workplace.  These discussions are ongoing and involve the co-operation and support of educational and training institutions.</P>
      <P>My Department is in the process of assuming overall policy responsibility for the vocational training and employment of persons with disabilities and will carry out its responsibilities in this area with vigour.  Each year approximately 200 persons with disabilities complete training in FÁS mainstream training programmes and 1,500 are in community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>Later this year FÁS will develop and implement an action programme for people with disabilities.  Targets will be set each year and the implementation of the programme monitored. The programme will be supported by a pilot project &mdash; Action for Disability.  The aim of this project is to test and develop mechanisms to ensure that greater numbers of people with disabilities enter into FÁS programmes.</P>

Equality and Law Reform and the relevant legislation to give legal protection against discrimination has nearly completed its passage through the Oireachtas.

When adopted, it will allow for rapid intervention by the European Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a member state, in disputes or protests which block access to the EU Internal Market.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined, in replies to previous parliamentary questions, the action I have taken where obstacles have been placed in the way of the free movement of Irish goods in other member states.  I will have no hesitation in taking similar action in future, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the financial package being promoted by the Industrial Development Authority to industrialists to locate in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the west region, IDA Ireland created 1,428 new jobs in 1997, a growth of 9.5 per cent for the region from the 944 new jobs created in 1996. There were also nine projects announcements for the west region during 1997.  The impact of these announcements will result in additional employment in the area during 1998 and in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is extremely conscious of its responsibility to promote and bring new investors to regional locations.  The companies supported by IDA are encouraged to look at many locations across the country during the process of their decision making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, IDA is: favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including the higher grant levels as appropriate; with the involvement of private sector investors, <Col N="503" /> stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations and working closely and in partnership with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to pursue a policy of encouraging and facilitating the most equitable regional distribution of jobs throughout the country, including the west.  The result of this proactive approach was reflected in 1997 in several project announcements for areas outside the larger urban centres.  Since this Government came into office, I announced industrial investments outside Dublin which will lead to the creation of some 14,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to attracting more investments to all regions and I can assure you that the west will continue to be extensively promoted during 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that Ireland can retain its position as an attractive investment base in the run up <Col N="504" /> to, and following, European Union enlargement. Ireland is presently competing satisfactory with its fellow European Union members for industrial investment.</P>
    <P>According to the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, Ireland has moved up to 11th position in the league table of most competitive countries &mdash; up from 22nd position in 1996 and 15th position in 1997.  Four main factors account for this: successive social partnerships; a young educated workforce; foreign direct investment and infrastructural investment in training, education, industry and transport.</P>
    <P>The ESRI Medium Term Review 1997-2003, commenting on the recent Irish growth experience, pointed to the very important role of foreign direct investment in transforming the economy. With less than 1 per cent of Europe's population and GDP, Ireland wins substantially higher levels of FDI than our natural share would warrant.  The part played by the IDA in achieving this success has been widely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the work of Forfás, the policy and advisory board for industrial development in Ireland, and the National Competitiveness Council established in 1997 under Partnership 2000 that IDA Ireland is pursuing its objectives within a global context which is increasingly competitive, complex and unpredictable.  We must successfully navigate our way through the strategic competitive issues and continue to adopt a prudent stance in regard to public expenditure, wages rates and the management of the economy if we are to improve on our economic performance in recent years and maintain our position as a competitive, attractive place for investment.  In this context the work of the National Competitiveness Council will be of vital strategic importance.  Ireland's confirmed participation in the single European currency should enhance our attractiveness as a location for internationally mobile investment.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Questions Nos. 61 and 64 on the 26 March 1998, I gave details of the two working groups to which the Deputy's question refers, the proposals which both groups were examining to address the IRNR problem and the recommendations which the interagency-departmental working <Col N="505" /> group made to me in relation to these proposals.</P>
      <P>I have accepted that the IRNR issue should be tackled on the three fronts recommended by the interagency-departmental group namely: in the taxation area, by equating registration with residency for tax purposes, subject to the grant of exemptions for certain companies, such as multinational companies; in the company law area through the introduction of requirements in relation to directorships and better enforcementstrike-off procedures and in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, area, through the application of the money laundering provisions of this Act to company formation agents.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is currently considering what will be done in the taxation area.</P>
      <P>In the company law area our Department has drawn up specific proposals in the areas in question in the form of draft heads for inclusion in the forthcoming Companies (Amendment) Bill.  In addition, to the measures mentioned in my reply of 26 March 1998, these proposals also include a provision to amend section 12 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, to enable the Registrar of Companies to move to strike companies from the register in a more timely and efficient manner where companies do not comply with their filing requirements.  The current position is that the draft heads have been circulated to interested parties for comments.</P>
      <P>The question of whether company formation agents can be brought within the scope of the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, is being considered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The IFSC group continues to operate and is currently monitoring progress in relation to the three proposals referred to.  As indicated in my reply of the 26 March 1998, there are no written terms of reference set out for the IFSC group and my understanding is that they will not be drawing up or publishing any formal report.  This group is a subgroup of the IFSC banking and treasury group which would of course report regularly on its activities to the clearing house group of the IFSC, the overseer of all IFSC working groups.</P>

      <P>On the first matter raised by the Deputy, the forthcoming Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1998, which is currently at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department, will comprehensively update copyright law in relation to films, sound recordings, broadcasts and cable programme services, and provide for a comprehensive scheme for protection for performers' rights and rights in performances, in line with international standards of protection in this area of intellectual property rights.  This scheme will, of course, include the rights of Irish performing artists in the music industry within its scope.</P>
      <P>As to the second matter raised by the Deputy, the framework of European Union law governing copyright and related rights and trade matters in general would effectively preclude any measure aimed at partitioning the Irish market in intellectual products from that of any other country within the European Single Market, including the United Kingdom.  Nor, in any case, would such a course seem realistic or desirable in the context of a music industry characterised by increasing integration and interdependence not only across the European Union, but across the world as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Multilateral Agreement on Investment, <Col N="507" /> known as the MAI, is being negotiated under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development &mdash; the OECD &mdash; in Paris.  It is intended to be a free-standing international treaty open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations.</P>
      <P>The state of play in the MAI negotiations and the Government's general approach and position on specific issues, including those raised by the Deputy in his question, were set out in the replies to parliamentary questions on 21 April 1998 and 12 May 1998.</P>
      <P>In short, based on the negotiations to date, the Government supports the conclusion of the MAI and expects that this country would in due course become a party to it.  As a small country with a high dependence on trade and foreign investment, we tend to favour a multilateral approach to dealing with regulatory issues that involve government.  A rule-bound system, such as the World Trade Organisation, WTO, offers in the case of trade, is, therefore, something we welcome. As the OECD is the only active forum for the negotiation of international investment rules, it is natural for us to support the MAI negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Government would have preferred if these negotiations could have been conducted in the WTO with the active participation of developing countries who form the majority in that organisation. As developing countries are not at present willing to engage in multilateral investment negotiations, this option was not available.  The Government fully respects the right of each developing country to choose what it considers best for itself in this area, although Ireland's own experience demonstrates how an open foreign investment regime can be a key factor in economic development.</P>
      <P>In relation to human rights and the environment, including the protection of natural resources, Ireland has argued in favour of a binding obligation not to lower labour or environment standards in order to attract or retain a particular investment.  There is a growing consensus in the negotiations for the inclusion of such provisions. The right of contracting parties to take action against companies which fail to comply with nondiscriminatory national laws in these areas is not affected by the provisions of the draft MAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All countries willing and able to meet the obligations of the MAI will be welcome to sign the agreement.  But no one will be obliged to do so. If a particular country, be it in the OECD or not, chooses to sign the MAI, it will provide a signal to foreign investors that they can expect to compete for investment opportunities in that country on a level playing field.  The extent of the welcome for investors will be qualified by the country &mdash; specific exceptions whereby each country can indicate the specific sectors or issues in respect of which it cannot meet the obligations of the MAI.  In negotiating lists of exceptions, I would expect that the special needs of acceding <Col N="508" /> developing countries would be given sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their particular systems and to determine the solution.  There is no way of preventing or avoiding the costs associated with solving this serious problem.  The level of cost and the economic impact in any particular case will totally depend, on the extent of the problem within each business.  It is important however, that Irish businesses urgently address this complex issue, as the cost of ignoring this problem could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem immediately.</P>
      <P>Government can only help in raising awareness of this issue and by providing guidelines to businesses to assist them in tackling the problem.</P>
      <P>Over 100,000 copies of an awareness leaflet on the year 2000 computer problem, prepared by our Department in June 1997, with the assistance of Forfás and IBEC, have been distributed to industry, chambers of commerce, professional bodies, State agencies and county and city enterprise boards, throughout the country.  This leaflet suggests initial steps to be taken to enable industry's IT systems deal with the date change.</P>
      <P>Some recent research on the year 2000 problem has indicated that while there is a high level of awareness of the problem the level of action to deal with the problem, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is urgently required.  Accordingly, on 6 May last, I launched a further awareness campaign, with which I am personally constantly involved. A further and more comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it has been circulated to businesses, both directly and indirectly, through industrial development agencies, county and city enterprise boards, chambers of commerce and other professional bodies.  I arranged to have copies of this brouchure circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  In addition, a series of regional public meetings are being held, to highlight awareness of the problem and, in particular, the urgency of the need to address the issue immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Department and myself have also had discussions with representatives of the financial sector, the insurance industry, the accountancy bodies and various other professionals, both national <Col N="509" /> and international, including the IT sector, to seek their assistance in highlighting the need for Irish businesses to take immediate action.  These interests have agreed to support the Government's campaign and I have established a national steering committee representing a range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to oversee the campaign and implement it at the level of their constituent membership.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to the House on 18 February 1998 on the subject of the relatively high motor insurance costs borne by young drivers.</P>
      <P>There is no simple solution to this complex problem presented by young or inexperienced drivers as a high risk insurance category.  The adverse statistics relating to high claims frequency and cost of claims by young drivers have been referred to on numerous occasions in this House and elsewhere.  The key to reducing insurance costs for young drivers resides in reducing claims by improving both safety standards and safety awareness and creating incentives for careful and claims free driving.</P>
      <P>As a result of our efforts, a number of initiatives have been taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers. These include: the introduction of a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, on completion of a required number of driving lessons; the introduction of road safety educational programmes for students and advertising campaigns by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding and the ongoing examination by the Department of Environment and Local Government of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers.  Such a system would assist insurers in refining and segmenting the young driver market in a more scientific manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concessions to young drivers have been introduced by some motor insurers, albeit against the background of increasing underwriting losses in the motor insurance sector.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government has also co-operated with the AA in the launch of an AA drink driving video aimed at young drivers.  The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety to fit in with the new primary school curriculum and have recently adopted a five year road safety programme <Col N="510" /> which includes the development of educational material in 1998 for transition year students in secondary schools, of whom some schools are also offering driver training courses on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>I am re-establishing the Motor Insurance Advisory Board to provide a mechanism for monitoring developments in motor insurance costs and to advise me on the factors influencing changes in motor insurance premium rates throughout Ireland.</P>

      <P>Since the advent of national economic and social partnership agreements in 1987, the industrial relations climate has maintained a marked improvement.

      <P>In the wake of the closure of Ballinamore Textiles Ltd. which exacerbated the unemployment situation in County Leitrim, I asked the Leitrim County Manager to convene a special enterprise project group to address the employment needs of the county.

    <P>Ms Dorothy Clarke, Chief Executive Leitrim, County Enterprise Board</P>
    <P>Ms Statia Carr, NT</P>
    <P>The group will concentrate on the following issues:</P>
    <P>assessment of the skills of the labour force in County Leitrim; provision of training and retraining opportunities of the labour force; marketing of County Leitrim for direct foreign investment; encouraging indigenous business opportunities in the county; highlighting the availability of the industrial development sites throughout County Leitrim; providing encouragement to those who wish to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in their own right; maximising the potential to the county of the urban renewal scheme and the new pilot rural renewal scheme and assessing the local infrastructural needs and liaising with the relevant State authorities.</P>
    <P>No time limit has been placed on the work of the group, which is expected to prepare its own programme of work and to establish the timescale in which it can expect to make progress.</P>

    <P>(9) Steering Group on the Review of the Air Corps and Naval Service:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Terms of Reference:</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the light of the Government decisions of 3 July 1995 and 5 March 1996 to review the existing operations of the Navy and Air Corps and to make recommendations to ensure the optimum use of resources in order to fulfil the roles set by Government.</P>
    <P>These were extended in September 1997 to include the following:</P>
    <P>(a) To determine, through consultation with the various interests involved including the Department of Finance, the current and the likely medium/longer-term extent of the State's requirements for sea and/or air support in the areas of:</P>
    <P>(i) fishery protection;</P>
    <P>(ii) search and rescue;</P>
    <P>(iii) drug interdiction;</P>
    <P>(iv) other aid to the civil power; and</P>
    <P>(v) other aid to the civil community.</P>
    <P>To the extent possible, to quantify such requirements by reference to historic tasking levels and/or, as appropriate, known or likely future needs and in so doing to develop minimum and maximum parameters for such requirements.</P>
    <P>(b) To recommend the most appropriate model for the provision of such services, taking account of models for the provision of such services in comparable jurisdictions/ environments, with particular emphasis on the key taskings of fishery protection, search and rescue and drug interdiction, for the purpose of developing a framework for decision-making on the State's current sea and air support requirements which will enable the following options to be meaningfully considered:</P>
    <P>(i) to have all the State's future sea and air support requirements discharged on a multitasked, multicapability basis by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, having particular regard to the implications for future staffing requirements and equipment purchase/replacement;</P>
    <P>(ii) to contract some of the State's sea and air support requirements from the private sector and/or to resource other State agencies to discharge some of the taskings involved.  The taskings to be considered <Col N="520" /> under this option would be taskings in excess of those currently discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps with current levels of manpower and equipment (including decisions already taken);</P>
    <P>(iii) to have any additional sea and air requirements over the above current tasking and capability levels provided by the Naval Service and the Air Corps on a dedicated basis, i.e. on the basis that the additional manpower and/or equipment assets provided will be used by the Naval Service and/or the Air Corps exclusively for the specific purposes provided; and</P>
    <P>(iv) whether the structure and equipment of the Naval Service and Air Corps in particular are appropriate to the taskings that the services currently carry out and if so whether these structures and types of equipment should be expanded/replicated in the event of additional tasks being imposed on either service.</P>
    <P>(c) In developing the above framework for decision-making, to construct a matrix which will allow all relevant factors to be taken into account, including the likely extent of future requirements by tasking, the implications for the State of the dedicated and multicapability approaches, the factors impacting on cost and value for money, the trade-offs between costs and different modes of operation and the benefits of different approaches.  The development of the matrix should also indicate the factors involved in and advice on how to treat the State's requirements for a contingent defence capability at sea and in the air as part of the total decision-making process.</P>
    <P>(d) To carry out the foregoing work in a manner which will enable the output to be incorporated into a consolidated report which also include the outcome of the current review of the Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>

      <P>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, requires that an employer must provide an employee with a written statement of the particulars of the employee's terms of employment.  It also provides that an employer must notify the employee of any changes in the particulars as given in the statement.</P>
      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, entitles all employees, other than those in parttime/casual employment, to have an immediate entitlement to public holiday benefits.  Part-time/casual employees must have worked at least 40 hours in the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday to qualify for public holiday benefit.</P>
      <P>An employee is entitled to whichever of the following his-her employer determines: (a) a paid day off on that day; (b) a paid day off within a month of that day; (c) an additional day of annual leave; (d) an additional day's pay.</P>
      <P>In the event that nurses employed in private nursing homes do not receive their entitlements under either of the Acts referred to above, it is open to them to pursue complaints to a Rights Commissioner.  The Rights Commissioner Service may be contacted at Tom Johnson House, Had-dington Road, Dublin 4.</P>

      <P>In principle community employment is a temporary employment scheme developed to provide unemployed <Col N="524" /> people with opportunities to update skills adversely affected by prolonged unemployment, to develop some new skills and also build up a recent track record of work experience which is most important when trying to convince employers of their ability-experience.  The objective is to progress CE participants into jobs in the open economy or into mainstream training if they are not job ready.</P>
      <P>Participants are generally engaged for a 12 month period.  However, a small proportion of participants may be re-engaged for further periods with the agreement of FÁS.  This would be so, where such participants are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available or where the participant would benefit from additional training-development.  In particular, participants on the part-time job option, who have an annual contract of engagement for 12 months, can have their contract renewed for up to a total of three years.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, my Department commissioned Deloitte and Touche to carry out an evaluation of the programme in terms of meeting its objective, to consider its efficacy in the light of current and evolving labour market conditions and to make proposals to improve the programme within existing resources.  That review should be completed by June of this year and its conclusions will inform future policy development in regard to community employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The initial findings by the EU Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE) on the impact on children's health from the use of soft PVC toys containing phthalates in child care articles and toys was presented to a meeting of the EU Committee on Product Safety Emergencies on 3 March 1998. Ireland is represented on this committee by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The member states agreed at this meeting that there was a need to find a European solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>Since that meeting the SCTEE has confirmed in a second opinion that the presence of phthalates in the products referred to gives cause for concern.  I understand that this second opinion has prompted the EU Commission to draft the proposal referred to by the Deputies.  In this regard, a draft decision adopting measures concerning the placing on the market of certain phthalate-containing toys and childcare articles is currently being considered by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The findings of the SCTEE do raise concerns and are valuable in heightening awareness of the potential dangers of phthalate leaching from soft PVC toys.  However, I can assure the Deputies that if a decision is taken by the Commission to restrict the placing on the market of the above products and this decision is in turn endorsed by the EU Committee on Product Safety Emergencies, the Director of Consumer Affairs will take whatever measures are necessary to comply with this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year reports were received from Denmark about babies teething rings and pacifiers which contained phthalates and had failed the appropriate <Col N="527" /> tests in Denmark.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has already carried out an investigation in Ireland on foot of these reports and was not able to detect any of the models which had failed those tests.  I am satisfied that appropriate vigilance is being maintained by the Director of Consumer Affairs in this regard and I have requested him to monitor developments closely.</P>

      <P>The practice known as &ldquo;car clocking&rdquo;, that is, mileage adjusting, to which the Deputy refers, is a criminal offence by virtue of section 2 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  The enforcement of this provision rests with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>An independent Client Services Commissioner has been appointed by FÁS to investigate unresolved disputes between FÁS and its clients.  The Client <Col N="530" /> Services Commissioner operates within the terms of a special scheme, details of which I am circulating separately, with complete independence from FÁS and, accordingly, the investigations and recommendations of the commissioner are completely impartial.</P>
      <P>The commissioner has power to investigate and make recommendations to resolve matters in dispute subject to the conditions of the scheme.  If, after investigation, it is found that the client's complaint is justified, the commissioner has power to recommend corrective action by FÁS and or compensation of up to £5,000 in a particular case.  This service is available free of charge to FÁS clients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to protecting the general health and safety of all workers does not lie in changing or amending what is fundamentally strong legislation &mdash; it lies in changing attitudes and particularly those of a certain minority of employers to health and safety management and in ensuring that they meet all their obligations, both legal and moral.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety and it sets out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities which employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment.  Under this legislation, it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.  The 1989 Act is supplemented by a series of regulations, in particular the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, and the <Col N="531" /> Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 1995.  The former extend the requirements of the Act and lay down provisions for health and safety in specific aspects of working activity such as the workplace, the use by workers of work equipment and personal protective equipment, manual handling of loads and work with display screen equipment.  The latter is one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one industry.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. This ongoing enforcement is carried out in an active manner.  The authority works to a targeted annual work programme, as approved by its tripartite management board, as well as regularly reviewing and focusing on sectors with high accident rates.</P>
      <P>There has been a steady increase in the funding and staff allocated to the authority since its inception. In 1990 Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million.  With regard to staffing, the authority currently has Government sanction for 119 people. However, a further comprehensive submission has been submitted by the authority to my Department in relation to future staffing needs, and this is currently being discussed between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current primary health and safety legislation is sufficient.  However, the 1989 Act is kept under constant review both by my Department and by the authority as regards its applicability and effectiveness, and should it be concluded from such reviews that regulation in this area would benefit from an amendment of or addition to existing legislation, I can assure the Deputy that the necessary steps will be taken accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully aware of the importance of each sector of the economy having available to it an adequate pool of personnel, equipped with the appropriate skills, if it is to develop to its full potential and contribute to our overall economic growth.  Since taking up office, the Government has taken a broad range of relevant initiatives. These include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a new business, education and training partnership, embodying an expert group on future skills needs, to develop strategies, at the highest levels, to tackle the <Col N="532" /> issues of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education for industry and business and to identify the practical steps required to secure and maintain a competitive advantage in the area of skills.</P>
    <P>The development of a skills awareness programme the activities of which, since May 1997, has undertaken the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the production and distribution to schools of a skills brochure and videos on software and technicians for school leavers,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a series of media background briefings,</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing an <i>Irish Times</i> supplement on technicians,</P>
    <P>&mdash;organising information briefings and a stand for the FÁS Opportunities 1998 exhibition.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a video on the teleservices industry for launch shortly and distribution to schools.</P>
    <P>The allocation, shortly after entering office, of an extra £5 million to commence the expansion of student intake in computing and technician courses, with a view to achieving an increased annual output of 1,000 computer graduates and 750 technicians.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a £250 million education technology investment fund.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £1.2 million to FÁS to expand its provision in the software and electronics areas.</P>
    <P>Extra provision for FÁS to meet increasing apprenticeship numbers &mdash; numbers have increased from some 3,000 three years ago to a record 5,500 in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, FÁS has undertaken an extensive promotional campaign to encourage Irish-born craftspersons, currently working in the United Kingdom, to consider returning to work in Ireland.  This campaign has been very successful, with an estimated 5,000 returning home in 1997 and a further 3,000 projected to return in 1998.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives aimed at encouraging labour supply and meeting skills needs include:</P>
    <P>Increasing the threshold for the payment of PRSI from £80 to £100, in order to make it more attractive for people to take up lower paid jobs.</P>
    <P>Introducing a tax initiative for the long-term unemployed, which benefits both the employee and the employer.</P>
    <P>Introducing a scheme of tax relief for fees paid in respect of certain approved courses in information technology and certain foreign languages where the cost of these fees is a minimum <Col N="533" /> of £250 and subject to a maximum qualifying level of £1,000.</P>
    <P>I would point out that my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recretion, Dr. McDaid, has responsibility for employment in the tourism industry.</P>

      <P>The planning and preparation process for the introduction of the euro is extensive with an intent in particular to assist the business community to be ready for the changeover.  In this context, the key to a successful transition to the euro is early preparation by the business sector.  This is a central message of the EMU business awareness campaign which is managed by Forfás on behalf of my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The issue of preparation for the euro among the small business sector has been a particular focus of the business awareness campaign over recent months.  A number of initiatives designed to specifically target smaller businesses have been initiated in this regard.  Features of the campaign include:</P>
      <P>&mdash; A consultative committee has been formed comprising representatives from employer organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and state agencies to act as a forum for co-ordination, co-operation and informaton exchange.  In addition working groups for the retail sector, for information technology, and for training have been formed whose remit is to address and make recommendations on specific issues relating to EMU.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Detailed information has been prepared in the form of an information pack, of which over 35,000 copies have been distributed.  It includes a planning framework and tools for business impact and analysis and functional checklists.  The information pack is regularly updated.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Preparation of a short user friendly brochure summarising the key issues for small business in relation to the changeover to the euro.  Over 82,000 copies of this brochure have been distributed to businesses through their representative organisations, state agencies etc.  and through special distribution with, and advertising in, magazines targeted at small firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" />&mdash; Relevant EMU material outlining how EMU issues should be dealt with has been distributed to over 140,000 businesses as part of a mailing with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An advertising campaign on the radio has alerted businesses to the advent of the euro and the need for preparations and offered businesses the opportunity to phone a dedicated euro line for information.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An inter-agency co-ordination group has been formed in order to ensure that support to enterprises from the state agencies is fully mobilized to assist them as far as possible in their preparations for EMU.  A programme of staff briefings has been completed and detailed targeting of companies is under way at the regional level.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government has published its own national changeover plan outlining the arrangements that will be made by Government Departments, the Central Bank, the NTMA and the Revenue Commissioners as well as banks, building societies and the Stock Exchange.  This will serve as a useful guide for businesses of all sizes and in all sectors as they prepare for the changeover.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore that Government plans are sufficiently advanced to facilitate the business community in its preparation for the changeover to the euro.  Continued co-operation with and preparation by the business community will, I am sure, result in the transition to the euro proceeding successfully.</P>

      <P>Both the Government of which I am a member and the previous Government have undertaken assessment of the impact for Irish trade and industry of the UK remaining outside of EMU.</P>
      <P>The previous Government authorised the then Minister for Finance to have an in-depth study undertaken of the likely economic implications of EMU for Ireland with particular reference to employment, including at sectoral level, in the context of various membership scenarios for relevant member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This study reached an overall conclusion that, assuming prudent policies, EMU membership would be favourable for Ireland that this conclusion held whether or not the UK also joined. Of course, the most favourable scenario would be if the UK did join.  Nonetheless it was found that <Col N="535" /> the balance of quantified effects was still favourable to Ireland even if the UK remained outside.</P>
    <P>As part of the EMU business awareness campaign, which Forfás is managing on behalf of the Government, Forfás is preparing a report to identify actions that companies could take to counter possible variations in the sterling-euro rate after EMU begins.  The focus of the report is therefore very much on contingency planning at company level.  In carrying out this work, analysis was made of which sectors were likely to be most affected by such possible currency variations.  This study will be available later this week.</P>

      <P>A framework is being put in place at EU level to facilitate the smooth transition to the euro.  This framework, which has a strong emphasis on consumer protection, contains both regulations which have direct effect in Ireland, as well as European Commission recommendations on the practical aspects of the changeover to the euro. These recommendations, which have been endorsed by the European Council, put in place standard codes of practice for retailers, banks, other service providers and public authorities in the areas of dual display of prices, bank charges and monitoring of prices.</P>
      <P>The recommendations are broadly aimed at facilitating a smooth changover to the euro while at the same time providing consumers with clarity and certainty over the transitional period.  The recommendation on dual pricing also covers existing euro regulations on the use of conversion rates and rounding rules.  In addition they address the main issues identified during a process of consultation by the Commission with the private sector and consumer groups.</P>
      <P>I fully support the voluntary approach put forward in these recommendations and consider that they provide a reasonable basis on which to agree voluntary codes.  My Department is responsible for policy in this area and my officials and the Director of Consumer Affairs will be fully involved in the development and monitoring of the voluntary codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, on dual pricing the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has already been involved with the food, drink and tobacco federation of IBEC which has drawn up a code of practice for its grocery trade members.  The Director's office is also involved with the Forfás retail group which consists of representatives from a large number of retailers' bodies, as regards codes of <Col N="536" /> practice for the changeover including the area of dual pricing.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs will also take the lead role in relation to monitoring of prices throughout the period of transition from the Irish pound to the euro.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures now in place at European level, backed up by action at national level, provide an adequate framework for a smooth transition to the euro and also provide clarity and protection to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The total number of apprentices in training for craft trades at present is 15,406.  This population has been growing from a low of just under 11,000 in 1995, with the highest growth rate being in the course of the last two years.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the growth has occurred in the construction trades which, taken together account for some 65 per cent of the current apprentice population. Employment in the construction industry generally is expected to continue to rise in the next five years by approximately 10 per cent and then to stabilise.  This, together with the general buoyancy of the economy, would suggest that the apprentice numbers will continue to grow over the next five years to between 17,000 and 18,000 for all trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This estimated growth will, however, depend very much on the recruitment policy of employers who will need to recruit apprentices in sufficient <Col N="539" /> numbers to meet future demands.  In view of the four year lead time for apprentice training, from commencement to final qualification, I would encourage employers to plan well in advance when considering apprentice recruitment to ensure that adequate numbers of apprentices will be available to meet the predicted skill needs of the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to examine the future role and structure of FÁS.  Arising from this examination and other developments within my Department, the Deputy will be aware of a recent Government decision to establish a new client-centred support structure for indigenous enterprise, involving the creation of a new enterprise support agency.  It is intended, in this connection, that certain elements of FÁS will be incorporated into this new agency.</P>
      <P>The strategic framework for developing our training system and programmes and ensuring that they are responsive to labour market needs was set out in the White Paper on Human Resource Development published last year. Many of the initatives proposed therein are into implementation phase.  Elements which are particularly relevant include:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the development of traineeships for which a target of some 5,000 places has been set by the year 2000</P>
      <P>&mdash; greater access by long-term unemployed to training programmes; in this regard FÁS will be adopting an action programme for the long-term unemployed later this year &mdash; enhanced provision for early school leavers; a £26 million suite of programmes has been developed to meet their needs</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; a more focused approach within their mainstream specific skills programmes to better respond to the needs of employers. A specific provision of £1.2 million has <Col N="540" /> been made for FÁS to respond to needs in the IT and electronics sector</P>
    <P>&mdash; on-going responsiveness to meeting demand for skilled craftspersons; apprenticeship numbers have increased from around 3,000 three years ago up to in excess of 5,000 currently.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, FÁS continually reviews the relevance and effectiveness of its training courses and course contents are upgraded to take account of industrial and technological developments.  Reviews are undertaken with the assistance of various interested parties which include education providers, employers, trade unions and representatives of the unemployed.</P>

      <P>Medium density fibreboard (MDF) is composed largely of softwood bound with a urea formaldehyde resin.  I am advised by the Health and Safety Authority that while concerns have been raised about the health effects of MDF, and in particular the possibility that it may be carcinogenic, the current position is that while hardwood dust can very rarely cause nasal cancer, the evidence that softwood dust can cause cancer is less conclusive.</P>
      <P>Formaldehyde vapour may be given off during the storage and machining of particle board and this can act as an irritant to eyes, nose and throat. However, studies to date indicate that persons machining MDF are not exposed to formaldehyde vapour at levels that affect health.  MDF does not come within the scope of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Carcinogens) Regulations, 1993 but is covered by the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, and the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (Chemical Agents) Regulations, 1994.  Neither does formaldehyde come within the scope of the carcinogens regulations &mdash; they only apply to category 1 and 2 carcinogens and formaldehyde is classified as a category 3 carcinogen.  Substances classified as category 1 carcinogens are known human carcinogens; substances classified as category 2 carcinogens are suspect human carcinogens; and substances classified as category 3 carcinogens are substances with a possible risk of irreversible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 58 of the Factories Act, 1955, as amended by section 20 of the Safety in Industry <Col N="541" /> Act, 1980, requires that all practicable measures be taken to protect persons against inhalation of dust and where practicable to provide exhaust applicances as near as practicable to the point of origin of the dust.  Regulation 3 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Chemical Agents) Regulations, 1994, requires that exposure to chemical agents be prevented or, where exposure cannot be avoided, be adequately controlled by various means such as replacement of agent, engineering controls etc., or personal protective measures where exposure cannot be reasonably avoided by other means.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has advised employers and employees that when MDF is machined, dust is generated which must be controlled. The finest dust and the greatest quantity is produced at sanding operations, whereas coarser dust is generated in operations such as sawing.  In practice, efficient, properly-maintained, local exhaust ventilation systems are the usual recommended means of control.  Where this is not practicable, for example, in some circumstances where portable or hand-held tools are used, protection can be achieved using a suitable dust mask.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority will consider the outcome of further research which is being undertaken abroad in relation to concerns about MDF dust and ill health, when it becomes available, with a view to developing further guidance in the matter if necessary.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent reports, particularly the study commissioned by the Business Software Alliance on the software industry in Europe, which outline the levels of business software piracy in Ireland.  If the figures suggested by the BSA are accurate, then it is an indictment of business practice in Ireland and must be condemned. Any significant level of copyright piracy must have a negative impact on the economy, both directly in revenues to the Exchequer and on employment figures and indirectly, but very importantly, in the perception of Ireland in the eyes of potential business software investors.  The BSA study will be examined in detail by my Department.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/250/EEC on the legal protection of computer programs was implemented in Ireland by S.I. 26 of 1993.  This provides a basis upon which to build strong penalties and remedies for copyright offences in the software field. Since coming into office, this Government has focused on the future enhancement of copyright and related rights legislation.  The first results of this were recently produced with the publication of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which proposes significant increases in penalties for copyright offences and strong presumptions on ownership of copyright.  I hope to have this Bill enacted shortly.  A more comprehensive copyright and related rights Bill will be published later this year.  That Bill, when enacted, will introduce into Ireland a system of copyright protection which will be in line with best international standards and will reflect the priority which this Government gives to reducing copyright piracy in all its forms.</P>
      <P>The practical application, especially via civil remedies, of the provisions of the new legislation should, as demonstrated in the BSA study, have a substantial impact on piracy levels in this country.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is funded almost entirely from the Exchequer rather than from EU Structural Funds.  In 1997, out of the total cost of £300 million support from the European Social Fund was £10.4 million and the quantum of support is likely to be similar this year.  A reduction in Structural Funds support post-1999 thus does not, in itself, imply a diminution in the size of the community employment programme.</P>
      <P>The number of places on the community employment programme was increased by 1,000 this year to 41,000.  The number of places on the jobs initiative was also increased by 1,000 to 2,000.  Any future targeting of community employment or increase in the number of active labour market places will take place in the light of wider developments in the labour market and having regard to the objectives set out in the employment action plan, which we submitted to the European Commission in April this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 151, 152, 153 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently 33 head office insurers authorised to underwrite motor insurance business in Ireland.  There are also 15 branches of insurers authorised in other EU member states and one branch of a non-EU authorised insurer entitled to underwrite such business in Ireland. There are also three non-established insurers who have notified us of their intention to underwrite motor insurance risks in the State.</P>
      <P>Insurance undertakings are not obliged to furnish information on the extent to which they have issued policies in classes for which they are authorised to do business or on the terms and conditions of the policies issued.  In these circumstances, it is not possible to provide data on the number of insurance companies actually offering motor insurance including data on policies for young drivers.</P>
      <P>With regard to young drivers, I can say that most insurers are reluctant to quote for drivers under 25.  In analysing young motorists' risk profile, the Deloitte and Touche consultancy report on insurance costs confirmed that, in a global context, young drivers as a group and individuals with poor safety records will have limited choice of insurers and face high premium rates throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>The report's own survey of motor insurance premiums indicated that there was no uniform &ldquo;market price&rdquo; for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market. Their survey showed that the key factors affecting the premium rates applied to the Irish motorists were the individual driver's maturity and safety record.  Within these parameters motor insurers quote a range of premium levels or decline to quote depending on their own underwriting criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to loading in relation to the area of residence of a driver, motor insurers are not obliged to submit data to us.  Segmentation of motor insurance markets operates, however, on a worldwide basis.  Premium levels are based on a variety of underwriting factors including location, the premise being that the heavier the traffic the greater the risk, resulting in higher premiums overall.  Traditionally, in Ireland, motorists residing in densely populated urban areas with large vehicle numbers such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick are charged proportionately higher motor insurance rates.  The Guardian Group announced sometime ago, a restructuring of its pricing policy in which motorists situated in County Louth and those parts of Counties Wicklow, Kildare and Meath within a 25 mile radius of Dublin are to be charged &ldquo;Dublin rates&rdquo; from the 1st December, last.  For PMPA customers, the group has indicated that this rating change is not to apply to male policyholders of ten years plus <Col N="545" /> standing with the company.  The company has stated that these increases are mainly due to rising claims costs and will be under continuous review, particularly as regards the ongoing affects of Operation Lifesaver.</P>

      <P>I have announced a further phase of grant-aid for this project under the tourism angling measure (TAM).  The grant-aid will extend the employment of the Boyne fisheries manager for a further year, and brings the total funding for this project to £98,000.</P>
      <P>The fisheries manager post is a component project of the Boyne Valley integrated development plan.  The task of the manager is to develop the potential of a pilot stretch of the river for tourist anglers.  His particular responsibilities are to identify the fisheries product in the Boyne catchment, to produce information material on the fishery and to work closely with the other agencies and individuals involved in achieving the objectives of the integrated development plan.</P>

      <P>Mediation in incidents such as this, and the handling of related compensation claims, is the responsibility of a sea fisheries officer of my Department within the framework of the code of practice for inshore fishermen and trawlermen. This code of practice was introduced to minimise the risk to local fishing gear from trawling activities and to facilitate compensation in cases of verifiable gear losses.</P>

      <P>The British Government announced on 1 March 1996 that it would be making changes to the Civil Service nationality rules from 1 June 1996.  The changes removed the &ldquo;Irish and Commonwealth preference&rdquo; and placed Irish, Commonwealth and other European Economic Area (EEA) nationals on an equal footing with regard to future recruitment to the UK Civil Service.  The changes did not affect the position of Irish and Commonwealth citizens already in post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was raised with the British Government at that time, through our Embassy in London and through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  The British side indicated that they had introduced these changes to guard against challenges in the European Court by nationals from other EEA contries, who might claim that the provision for Irish and Commonwealth citizens discriminated <Col N="550" /> against them.  They also stated that the effect of the changes was to restrict access by Irish citizens to some posts but that they would continue to be eligible for some 75 per cent of total Civil Service posts.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern which has been expressed about this change, including by the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain, and this concern has been conveyed to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the British Government may be considering the introduction of new legislative arrangements in the future regarding Civil Service nationality rules.  In this context, and in consultation with the Department of Finance which is the responsible Department in this jurisdiction, we will continue our consultations on the issue with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>The Department has drawn up a plan to ensure that it is year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999. This plan covers all IT hardware and software along with other office equipment and plant.  The plan includes the following: an inventory of all hardware and software in the Department, close contact with suppliers, on-site testing and replacement/upgrading of any non compliant hardware or software.  Work on implementation of the plan is currently under way.  Within the Department two committees have been set up to monitor and oversee progress &mdash; one relating to the Department itself and the other to the agencies under the aegis of the Department, such as National Committee for Development Education, Refugee Agency, Agency for Personal Service Overseas and Irish Aid Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>The plan was submitted to the Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee in December 1997 and a quarterly report was made in April 1998.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate the full cost of compliance given that most of the Department's systems/hardware would have been due for upgrade in any event.  Excluding any such upgrades/replacements, which will, of course, be year 2000 compliant, the estimated cost of specific year 2000 related activity is £195,000.</P>

      <P>I understand that this question is prompted by the case of a Paraguayan national whom the Virginia State authorities had neglected to inform of his rights under the Vienna Convention to a visit by his consular representative.  The individual concerned was subsequently sentenced to death and was executed on 14 April last.  It is my understanding that he did receive a visit by his consular representative prior to his execution.</P>
      <P>As I said on 29 April in my reply to a previous question related to this case, I share the Deputy's concern that in some cases State authorities in the United States are not informing foreign nationals of their right under the Vienna Convention to a visit by their consular representative, nor informing foreign consular representatives when one of their nationals is in custody.  I have no reason to believe that this is a result of a deliberate policy by State authorities but rather the result of a lack of awareness of their obligations. However, the United States federal authorities are aware of the breach of their obligations under the Vienna Convention.  In fact I understand that, in the case of the Paraguayan national, the Secretary of State, Ms Albright wrote to the Governor of Virginia requesting him to delay the execution.  The Secretary of State pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> the possible negative consequences for the many US citizens living and travelling abroad if some countries were to draw the conclusion that the US did not take it obligations under the Vienna Convention seriously.  Despite this, the State authorities proceeded with the execution.  In a second case, that of a Honduran national sentenced to death in Arizona, the US State Department requested the relevant authorities to consider the fact that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated, although it did not, I understand, ask for the execution to be postponed.  Once again this was to no avail as the execution took place on 22 April.</P>
      <P>I understand that the State Department is taking steps to ensure that State authorities in the US will be informed of their obligations.  I have instructed the Embassy in Washington and Consulates General in the US to monitor the situation and, if further cases arise, I will make appropriate representations.</P>

      <P>Since the development and maintenance of bilateral cultural relations with other countries is a primary function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the cultural relations committee operates to policy guidelines of an administrative nature laid down by the Department.  The Department of Finance stipulates the conditions and accounting systems under which the allocation for cultural relations may be spent.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the allocation is to enable the Department to carry out, or to give financial support to, Irish cultural projects of a high artistic standard with a view to enhancing Ireland's image and reputation abroad, and the promotion of friendly relations and mutual knowledge and understanding with other countries.  It is expended at the decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, guided to a large extent by the recommendations of the CRC.</P>
      <P>The committee assesses eligible applications on their merits, follows its established guidelines and makes independent recommendations as regards the artistic and cultural projects to be assisted. The Embassy of Ireland to the country for which an event is proposed is asked for its observations. The committee takes these into account in its recommendations.  Decision on the making of a grant rests with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The CRC operates in a way which complements the work of the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands and specifically the work of An Chomhairle Ealaíon/Arts Council.  In this connection it should be noted that the director of the Arts Council is by practice appointed to serve on the CRC.  The Department of Foreign Affairs through its cultural section is also responsible for cultural agreements with other countries and, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, draws up work programmes for their implementation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grants recommended by the CRC is to give support in other countries to Irish cultural activities of excellence.  In deciding on the activities to be assisted, attention is also given to their potential to promote tourism and investment from abroad.  This is a primary reason all applications are circulated to the Irish mission in the relevant country, so as &mdash; among other things &mdash; to assess the potential which the project might have to influence foreign earnings whether from tourism, trade or inward investment.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of the opening of an Ireland House is the ease of access by the Embassy to the views of the other State offices in the country concerned, including Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Discussions have been taking place on a joint British and French proposal for a European Union code of conduct based on the eight agreed common criteria for some months now.  Political agreement was reached on the text of the code at the General Affairs Council yesterday.</P>
      <P>Ireland has long advocated the adoption of measures to ensure the effective implementation of the EU common criteria in line with our objective of the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and technologies for military use.  Under the Irish Presidency in 1996 some initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for internal use by arms export licensing authorities was agreed.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations for the EU code of conduct, our primary objective was to ensure the code's credibility as a promoter of restraint and responsibility.  To be credible, the code needed to contain clear unequivocal language on human rights.  Throughout the process, Ireland advocated the strongest possible language on human rights consistent with the importance we place on human rights in our foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I am disappointed therefore at the outcome in respect of the human rights criterion.  I had wanted to see a provision envisaging complete abstention from arms exports to countries where there have been serious violations of human rights but certain partners were not even able to accept the possibility of restraint in respect of such arms exports.</P>
    <P>While Ireland could have blocked adoption of the code on the grounds of this inadequacy, I took the view that even a limited step by the EU in this area is preferable to no step at all.  We will use the opportunities presented by the annual review mechanism in the code to continue our efforts to ensure that responsible export control policies are put in place by all our partners in the EU and to press for the clearest possible language on human rights.</P>

      <P>Customer services by the State bodies under the aegis of my Department, including complaints procedures, are day-to-day operational issues in which I have no statutory function. However, the commercial State bodies under the aegis of my Department have committed themselves to the code of practice for the delivery of services to customers of commercial State bodies published in January 1997.  This code of practice involved establishing a well publicised and readily available complaints procedure and a satisfactory system of redress as well as making <Col N="556" /> every effort to resolve problems-complaints to customers' satisfaction.  All the State bodies under the aegis of my Department have systems in place to deal with customers' complaints.  Some of these have already been formalised into customers' chapters or are in the process of being formalised.  In addition, a new customer complaints commissioner has recently been appointed by ESB.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, statutory responsibility for dealing with all complaints from the public including complaints against State bodies rests with either or both the Ombudsman and the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Moreover, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has certain powers to investigate disputes regarding the provision of voice telephony services, provided such a complaint is not the subject of an investigation under the Ombudsman Act, 1980. The question of whether State bodies should continue to be within the remit of the Ombudsman if and when their sectors are liberalised requires to be addressed in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the investment requirements on the Maynooth line.  These have been examined by CIE and by my Department in the context of EU funding.  From work done to date it is clear that there are three principal components to the upgrading of this service. The first and most important is an upgrading of signalling in the city centre area to facilitate increased levels of service.  The other elements are an upgrading of trackwork, including the doubling of the line from Clonsilla to Maynooth, and the provision of additional rolling stock.</P>
      <P>Consultations have begun on the reallocation of the EU funds decommitted from the light rail project.  As I have previously indicated in this House, my Department has been working with CIE for some time to identify potentially suitable projects on the Dublin suburban rail network, including the Maynooth line, which could avail of the decommitted EU assistance.</P>

      <P>In recent years, the Department and the Defence Forces have invested significant resources in upgrading computer systems in the main business areas such as payroll, financial management, inventory management and procurement.</P>
      <P>While this investment was largely driven by business needs, the opportunity was taken to identify and plan the replacement or upgrading of systems which were not year 2000 compliant. As a result many of the systems in use are now compliant.  A comprehensive plan aimed at ensuring the compliance of IT systems was drawn up in 1997.  In accordance with this plan, a compliance audit of all systems will be completed in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Defence Forces are confident that full compliance will be achieved in the lifetime of the current IT investment programme which runs to 1999.</P>
      <P>Given that the investment programme is largely driven by business, as distinct from year 2000 needs, the Department has not calculated compliance costs <i>per se.</i>  It might be of some assistance, however, to mention that total planned IT expenditure, capital and current, for the period 1997 to 1999, inclusive, is £9.3 million and this is expected to meet all IT needs, including year 2000 needs.</P>

      <P>I am of course well aware of the constraints placed on all farmers by the restrictions of the milk quota system.</P>
      <P>Significant measures have been taken over the years to ensure that development plan farmers were given priority access to additional milk quota on either a temporary or permanent basis under the schemes introduced as part of the implementation of the Community legislation in Ireland.  In the first instance, development plan farmers were granted priority access to unused quota (flexi-milk) temporarily allocated after the end of each milk quota year.  Furthermore, after 1988, development plan farmers were given priority access to additional quota under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes.  In addition, specific provisions were made for smaller scale development plan farmers under an EU 1 per cent reserve created in 1989.</P>
      <P>When priority access to flexi-milk was withdrawn from development plan farmers by the EU institutions on the adoption in 1992 of the EU regulations currently applicable, I set aside, out of the national reserve, a quarter of a million gallons which was permanently allocated in 1993-4 amongst such farmers <i>pro-rata</i> to their dependence on flexi-milk over the preceding years.</P>
      <P>Additional milk quota has also been allocated to several development plan farmers on the recommendation of the milk quota appeals tribunal.</P>
      <P>Within the constraints of the quota system, it is clear that considerable efforts have been made to improve the position of these producers and they continue to have priority access to additional quota under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes and they also have the possibility of applying to the milk quota appeals tribunal for additional allocations.</P>

    <P>All slaughterings at premises under the supervision of my Department took place in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995 (S.  I. No. 114 of 1995).  These regulations lay down standards for the protection of animals at the time of slaughter and give effect to Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993.</P>
    <P>Although there are no official statistics available relating to ritual slaughtering of animals, I can confirm that no ritual slaughterings of broiler chickens took place in premises supervised by my Department in either year.  In regard to the other livestock, ritual slaughterings are mainly in respect of exports of meat to Islamic countries. There were no exports of sheepmeat or pigmeat to such countries in either 1996 or 1997.</P>
    <P>In the case of beef exports to countries which traditionally request slaughtering by ritual methods, 97,000 tonnes were exported 1996 and 126,000 tonnes were exported in 1997.  These figures would equate to approximately 290,000 and 378,000 heads of cattle.</P>

On learning of it, I made clear my opposition to the race going ahead and initiated contacts with the Punchestown authorities in the matter.  As the Deputy will be aware, the race was cancelled by the Punchestown authorities on foot of their contacts with the Department and the Garda.  I believe that they acted responsibly in making this decision and commend them for so doing.  I am happy to note that my Department's role in helping to bring about this outcome has been recognised and welcomed by a number of animal welfare groups.</P>

      <P>The applicant declared 66.60 hectares on his 1997 area aid application form.  The maps which accompanied the application form have been digitised and validated against aerial photography. The digitised area found amounted to 45.08 hectares.  In an effort to reconcile this overclaim maps of the digitised area have been sent to the person concerned, who should clarify the position as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for grants under the 1997 suckler cow premium, special beef premium and ewe premium schemes.</P>
      <P>He holds no suckler cow quota rights therefore no suckler cow premium grants can be paid.</P>
      <P>His herd was inspected for special beef premium outside the retention period.  No animals were presented and he was requested to provide sales documentation to confirm that he held the animals for the retention period.  No documentation has been received to date.</P>
      <P>He applied for grants on 84 ewes under the 1997 ewe premium scheme.  There were eight of these ewes absent at inspection.  Under the relevant commission regulation the amount payable in this case must be reduced by 21.05 per cent.  This reduced ewe premium payment will issue to the person named within the next week.</P>

      <P>The person named applied in 1997 for arable aid under the simplified scheme on 15.09 hectares of cereals.  Payment has issued for this application in full.  The 1998 application for this person has been made under the simplified scheme for which no setaside land is required.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for 23 animals on the 22 month special beef permium in November 1997.  The date of birth declared for tagnumber YRA64096 was inconsistent with the age previously declared on the same tagnumber by the person named at the time of submission of his ten month application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Test reports held in my Department verify <Col N="567" /> the ten month declaration to be correct and therefore the animal concerned has been rejected with consequent reduction penalties on the remaining animals for the 22 month special beef premium.  A payable order for 90 per cent advance will issue for the reduced amount of £1,704.31 over the coming week.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven premium rights were required to use at least 70 per cent of those quotas in 1996, otherwise the parts not used would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>There is no record in my Department that one of the persons named ever held a suckler cow quota.</P>
      <P>The other person named held a suckler cow quota of 13 premium rights but it was not used in 1996.  That person was asked by my Department in February 1997 to give the reason for non use of the quota in 1996 but no reply was received from her.  My Department has no record of having received an application from her to lease out her quota in 1996.</P>
      <P>The quota was therefore returned to the national reserve and I regret to say that it cannot be restored at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>if the full application for special beef premium payments will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Wexford in view of the fact that he has the same land on which he was paid the full compliment of stock in 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has no record of having received a completed 1997 area aid application from the person concerned.  He is therefore entitled to be paid grants on up to 15 livestock units when account is taken of any milk quota held and any ewes applied on under the 1997 ewe premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named made an application for 30 ewes under the ewe premium scheme in January 1997, this application was processed and full payment issued in respect of 4.5 livestock units &mdash; 30 ewes × 0.15 LU &mdash; for £368.73. He also applied for 24 animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme in December 1997 all of which were under 24 months of age and as such were each classified as 0.6 of a livestock unit.  However the remaining livestock units payable were only 10.5 LU's &mdash; i.e. 15 - 4.5 = 10.5. Accordingly, he <Col N="568" /> was paid £1,420.17 &mdash; 17.5 × 90.17 × 90 per cent &mdash; under the 1997 special beef premium scheme. Any remaining entitlement cannot be paid until such time as a definitive position is known in relation to usage of Ireland's 1997 special beef premium quota.  Quota usage is determined by reference to the overall number of animals ultimately qualifying for payment under the ten months scheme.  It is expected that the position will become clear shortly.</P>
    <P>The same situation arose in 1996 as the person named did not submit an area aid application and was therefore restricted to a maximum of 15 livestock units under the schemes applied for. Accordingly, payment issued in full for the 30 ewes applied for under the ewe premium scheme and 17.5 animals under the special beef premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted two ten month special beef premium applications during 1997, one on 31 October 1997 in respect of four animals and one on 18 November 1997 in respect of one animal.  The October application was the subject of an on farm inspection following which one female animal was deleted without penalty leaving three eligible animals.</P>
      <P>Ninty per cent payments have issued in respect of both applications.

      <P>The person named applied on 15 beef cows under the 1997 beef cow headage scheme. All the animals on the application had declared calving dates in 1997.  Under condition 24 of the terms and conditions of the scheme, beef cows had to calve in 1997 to qualify for beef cow grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 July 1997 an inspection was carried out on the herd of the person named, and his application appeared to be in order at that time.  On 12 January 1998 a spot check was carried out, and <Col N="569" /> as a result of this inspection, six of the animals were rejected for beef cow grants as they had not calved in 1997.</P>
    <P>No grants were payable to the person named under condition 28 of the terms and conditions of the 1997 beef cow headage scheme, which states that no grants are payable where an application covers not more than 20 animals, and over four of these animals are rejected.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for ten animals on a ten month special beef premium application on 24 February 1997.  To date the applicant has received £468.91, which is 60 per cent of his entitlement on nine animals.  Initially there was a query in relation to one animal, which was registered by the applicant with a different date of birth to that declared on his application and cattle identity card.  The details have now been amended on the registration system.  Payment for this animal, along with the 30 per cent due on the remaining animals will issue within the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the full entitlement has yet to be determined as it depends on the usage of Ireland's special beef premium quota for 1997. Quota usage is determined by reference to the number of animals ultimately deemed eligible for the ten months premium.  It is expected that the <Col N="570" /> position regarding overall quota usage will become clear shortly.</P>
    <P>The second instalment of the suckler cow premium will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

The digitised area amounted only to 73.96 hectares.

There has been no reply to date from the person named.  Consequently the Department has no option but to apply a 100 per cent penalty on all area aid based payments.

      <P>Since 1992 the Revenue Commissioners have been collecting figures with a view to assessing the growth in employment in firms assisted by the BES. While the figures available so far do not, in themselves, provide reliable indicators of the total number of jobs saved or created solely because of the BES, they provide a basis for more detailed reviews of the economic efficiency of the BES.</P>
      <P>In late 1997 a general review of the business expansion scheme was undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This review showed that for the period from February 1996 to the end of September 1997, 151 companies certified by Forbairt, which intended to raise just over £86 million investment under the scheme, planned to create or maintain 5,004 jobs. It is estimated that, based on the level of tax relief available at the time, the tax foregone by the Exchequer on the amount raised would be in the region of £41 million.</P>

One of these conditions is that, in certain circumstances, the transferee must on that date be the holder of a certificate issued by Teagasc, certifying satisfactory attendance at a course of training in either or both agriculture and horticulture, the aggregate duration of which exceeded 180 hours.  There are no provisions whereby a person who has not completed the full 180 hours on the date of execution of the deed may benefit from the relief.</P>
      <P>As the transferee in this particular case had not completed the full 180 hours attendance on 1 June 1997 the date of execution of the deed, he is not entitled to the reduced rate of stamp duty and, accordingly, a refund does not arise.  The solicitors acting in this case were notified of the position on 16 March 1998.</P>

      <P>The question of ensuring year 2000 compliance is being actively pursued by my Department and those offices and agencies under its remit, in line with formal year 2000 plans which have all been put in place last year.  These plans quantified the effort involved in making computer hardware and software and office equipment fully compliant. The work identified is currently under way and measures have been put in place to monitor progress, both within my own Department and those Government offices and agencies under its aegis.</P>
      <P>Along with all Government Departments and offices, my Department now provides quarterly reports on such progress to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee which I established last year to oversee the achievement of the year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment in the Civil Service.  The committee, which is chaired by my Department, has already reported to Government and will be continuing to report on a two monthly basis from now on.</P>
      <P>With regard to costs, the plans drawn up last year by Government Departments and offices identified the extra costs which they expected to incur in achieving full compliance and these follow for those offices under my remit.  Specific costs are not available for the agencies, nor is it possible at this stage to identify accurate costs on the work carried out to date.</P>

      <P>The Border region is already receiving special financial assistance under various Programmes related to its situation.  These programmes include INTERREG, which provides for over £100 million for the region, in both EU and domestic funding over the six years from 1994 to 1999, the Peace Programme &mdash; this has provision for approximately £83 million in EU and domestic funds for the Border region for the years 1995 to 1998 &mdash; and the International Fund for Ireland, which has already provided around £90 million for projects in the Border counties in the past ten years.  All of these programmes are ongoing.  The EU Commission has also recently approved more funding under the Peace Programme, which should see a further £21 million in funds being available for the Border region in 1999.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that, in relation to the infrastructural needs of the Border region, and as part of the planning process for post-1999 Structural Funds, I have written to all regional authorities seeking their proposals for investment in their regions, including their proposals for cross-Border co-operation.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that this question refers to residential premises in rural areas which are let and the effect of the recent Finance Act &ldquo;brought in as a result of the Bacon report&rdquo; on the tax treatment of the rental income from such houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the tax law relating to rental income, a person may claim a deduction from gross rent in respect of such items as: ground rent, rates, the actual cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management fees, wear and tear on furniture and fittings, and the interest on borrowings used in the purchase, improvement or repair of the premises, in arriving at the taxable rent.  As regards the interest on borrowings, no distinction was made up to now between rented residential <Col N="581" /> premises and other rented premises.  However, under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, the interest on borrowings used to purchase, improve or repair premises will not in certain circumstances be allowed as a deduction in arriving at the taxable rent.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain transitional arrangements for pipeline cases, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 provides that interest on borrowed money used on or after 23 April 1998 &mdash; 7 May, 1998 in the case of foreign properties &mdash; in the purchase, improvement or repair of a residential premises cannot be offset against rental income in arriving at the taxable rent, or allowable loss, in respect of that premises.  The restriction covers individuals, companies, trusts and partnerships.</P>
    <P>A person who owned rented residential property on 23 April 1998 and had up to that date been entitled to offset loan interest against the rents from that property can continue to claim the loan interest as a rental deduction.  However, if the person used the rented house as his or her main residence after 23 April 1998 and subsequently lets it again, the loan interest would not thereafter be allowable as a rental deduction.</P>
    <P>The new restriction will not apply to residential premises in qualifying resorts under the seaside resort scheme.  Such premises include accommodation for letting to tourists and in respect of which capital allowances may be claimed, and other accommodation for renting to tourists in respect of which &ldquo;section 23 type&rdquo; relief is available; rented residential accommodation &mdash; both &ldquo;section 23 type&rdquo; and non-section 23 type premises &mdash; in areas to which the new rural renewal scheme applies.  These areas cover parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo as well as the entire counties of Leitrim and Longford; some holiday cottages and other self-catering accommodation outside of qualifying resort and rural renewal areas. The premises in question are those in respect of which an application for planning permission was received by a local authority before 23 April, 1998 and where the planning permission when received includes a condition that the premises cannot be let for more than two consecutive months to any one person-and such condition is still in force in the tax year in which rents are receivable.  As regards the condition that the premises cannot be let to the same person for two consecutive months, it is accepted that local authorities may use different wording in imposing what is essentially the same condition in planning permission.  The Revenue Commissioners will not be taking a literal interpretation of the twomonth rule and will allow exemption in any case where the premises is clearly confined, as part of the planning permission, to short-term lettings.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners have prepared an explanatory leaflet on the new changes regarding loan interest as a rental deduction and this will be available next week.  This leaflet will include details of the transitional arrangements for pipline cases.</P>
    <P>

      <P>Once the legislation dealing with vehicle registration tax (VRT) is enacted, its administration is a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. I am informed by that office that the vehicles referred to by the Deputy are illegally converted vehicles which have been encountered recently by the revenue mobile service.  An illegally converted vehicle is one which has been converted to a higher vehicle registration tax category and on which the additional VRT due has not been paid. It is an offence contrary to section 139 (3) (ee) of the Finance Act, 1992, as amended, for a person to be in possession of such a vehicle.  The penalty is forfeiture of the vehicle and the payment of a fine of £1,000, on conviction.  The most common form of conversion is where a goods-carrying category C vehicle, liable to VRT of £40, is converted to a category A passenger vehicle, liable to VRT of 22.5 per cent or 28 per cent of the open market selling price.  The fitting of seats and-or windows to the rear of such a vehicle constitutes conversion.</P>
      <P>The number of illegally converted vehicles seized in 1998 to date is 83.  To date, 81 of those vehicles have been released on payment of varying compromise settlements.  The amount of each compromise settlement depends on: the circumstance of each case, the type of conversion involved, the amount of VRT evaded, and whether, on release, the owner intended to retain the vehicle in its existing condition or reconvert it to its original state.</P>
      <P>A further 28 cases were reported with a view to the institution of legal proceedings.  Compromise sums <i>in lieu</i> of proceedings were accepted in these cases.</P>
      <P>The amount of tax being evaded on these illegal conversions is considerable.  In view of the potential loss to the Exchequer, I have no plans to make changes to the existing legislation.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="583" /> form RCT 1 is a declaration completed jointly by a principal contractor and a sub-contractor who are about to enter into a relevant contract, as defined in section 530 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  A relevant contract, in the case of the building industry, is a contract to perform certain construction operations, not being a contract of employment.</P>
      <P>The form was introduced in 1996, in accordance with a recommendation from the black economy monitoring group.  On the form, the principal and sub-contractor declare that, having regard to the guidelines which from time to time may be published by the Revenue Commissioners as to the distinctions between contracts of employment and relevant contracts, they have satisfied themselves that, in their opinion, the contract which they propose to enter into is not a contract of employment.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Revenue currently has 45 members of staff engaged in a nationwide campaign aimed at detecting cases in the building industry in which persons who are employees have been incorrectly classified as self-employed sub-contractors.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of forms RCT-DC issued in the year ended 30 April 1998 was 236,666 and the number of C2s issued in the same period was 30,380.  It should be noted that the number of forms RCT-DC issued represents the number of blank forms issued by Inspectors of Taxes to principal contractors. Revenue does not have a figure for the number of completed forms issued by principal contractors to subcontractors.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the form RCT 1 is a declaration completed jointly by a principal contractor and a sub-contractor who are about to enter into a relevant contract, as defined in section 530 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  A relevant contract, in the case of the building industry, is a contract to perform certain construction operations, not being a contract of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the form, the principal and sub-contractor <Col N="584" /> declare that, having regard to the guidelines which from time to time may be published by the Revenue Commissioners as to the distinctions between contracts of employment and relevant contracts, they have satisfied themselves that, in their opinion, the contract which they propose to enter into is not a contract of employment.</P>
    <P>The form was introduced in 1996, in accordance with a recommendation from the black economy monitoring group.  The black economy monitoring group operates under the aegis of Partnership 2000.  This group includes representatives from employers, from the unions, from Revenue and from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  There is a special subcommittee of the black economy monitoring group which deals with the construction industry. It was this subcommittee which originally recommended that the RCT 1 declaration be introduced. Members of the group are free to call for a meeting of this group, at which any difficulties can be brought to the notice of Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Revenue are currently undertaking a nationwide campaign aimed at detecting cases in the building industry in which persons who are employees have been incorrectly classified as self-employed sub-contractors.  It is expected that the first phase of the campaign will be completed shortly.  At that stage, the usefulness of the RCT 1 procedure will be reviewed.</P>

The net receipts of income tax paid under the PAYE system in the calender years 1996 and 1997 are estimated at £3,894.4 million and £4,356.4 million respectively. These figures include tax receipts attributable to company directors which cannot be distinguished in the overall totals.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The job assist scheme is a new initiative introduced recently to assist the long-term unemployed back to employment.  At my request the Revenue Commissioners undertook a nationwide advertising campaign on the scheme aimed at both the long-term unemployed and potential employers using national, regional and community radio stations.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the volume of inquiries at Revenue information offices suggests that the campaign has been very successful.</P>
      <P>In view of the different audiences involved in this scheme two separate information leaflets are available, one providing information on the scheme for employers and the other for potential employees.  The job assist scheme does not apply to jobs which are supported under existing labour market schemes such as the back to work allowance scheme administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or Jobstart which is administered by FÁS.  This information is highlighted in the leaflet prepared for prospective employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have direct responsibility for the job assist programme. Where customers have inquiries in relation to schemes and services for which the Revenue Commissioners do not have responsibility and in respect of which Revenue staff may not have the necessary expertise, they will generally be given advice as to where their inquiries can best be dealt with.  Revenue's forms and leaflets office also stocks the information leaflet produced by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the back to work allowance scheme and issues it to members of the public on request. One of Revenue's key objectives is to develop its customer service to make it as easy as possible for its customers to understand and deal with their tax affairs.  An important strategy in achieving this objective has been the establishment of Revenue information offices.  These offices provide a wide range of information on all areas of Revenue and they afford the public a ready access to Revenue's services.  The type of services provided by Revenue range from information on all taxes, registering new customers, amending tax free allowances, explaining legislation and aspects of Revenue policy, assisting customers with returns and generally providing a skilled service which has been acknowledged by tax practitioners and commentators alike.  Revenue staff are well trained and highly motivated and are equipped with all the necessary skills and knowledge and backup facilities to ensure they are conversant with all aspects of the information provided. This year it is expected that there will be <Col N="589" /> 650,000 personal callers to Revenue offices throughout the country.  In the two Dublin offices alone there will be an average of approximately 6,000 callers per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing a quality service for its customers in relation to taxation matters, Revenue staff have a basic knowledge of other schemes relating to the unemployed and will give any assistance they can to customers with inquiries about such schemes.  However, it is important to realise that they are not experts in all aspects of the schemes and services provided by other Government Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Finance my responsibility for the matters raised in the Deputy's question is confined to the Civil Service; it does not extend to the wider public service.</P>
      <P>Up until the early 1990s, the upper age limit for recruitment to many general service grades in the Civil Service ranged from 20 to 30 years.  This was raised to 50 years in 1991, arising from a commitment in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP.  At the same time, and again arising from the PESP commitment, age limits in many open competitions for professional and departmental grades in the Civil Service were also raised to 50 years.</P>
      <P>This 50 year limit has now itself lapsed, and in general, upper age limits will no longer apply to recruitment to the Civil Service.  This new departure reflects my determination to align policy in this area with the terms of the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, which is currently before the Oireachtas.  The Bill prohibits age discrimination in recruitment between the ages of 18 and 65, subject to certain limited exceptions.  These exceptions allow age limits to be set: where there is clear actuarial or other evidence that significantly increased costs would arise if the age limits were not imposed, to take account of any cost or period of time involved in training a recruit to a standard at which the recruit will be effective in the job, or to take account of the need for there to be a reasonable period of time prior to retirement age during which the recruit will be effective in the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All recruitment to general service grades will proceed without upper age limits.  However the Bill's exceptional provisions may have some relevance to the professional and departmental streams within the Civil Service, and my Department is currently consulting with line Departments so as to identify any departmental or professional recruitment grades in which an upper age limit <Col N="590" /> would be necessary in accordance with the terms of the Employment Equality Bill.</P>

In relation to the provision of such services for children of school going age, the report of the special education review group recommends that where speech therapists are working full time in schools, they should be funded by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

    <P>I intend to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, the needs of children of school going age in relation to both speech and language therapy and psychological services with a view to determining how best progress can be made in enhancing the level of both these services for this group in the light of the recommendations of the special education review group on the provision of these services. <Col N="591" /></P>

      <P>Ireland has long supported a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship at EU level and the decision of the European Parliament is therefore welcomed.  The measure now requires approval by the Council of Ministers.  Technically it is not possible therefore at this stage to give a timescale for implementation as the EU Directive on the matter has not yet issued.</P>
      <P>However, let me assure the Deputy that my Department is examining the matter with a view to having an effective implementation strategy as soon as is feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 283 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding waiting list statistics is set out in the following tables one and two.  December 1997 is the latest period for which figures are available. To date a sum of £9 million has already been allocated by my Department to the participating agencies as set out in table three.</P>
      <P>The remaining £3 million will be allocated towards cardiac surgery and other services in the near future.  The objective of the funding provided under the waiting list initiative is to reduce waiting times in target specialties to 12 months or less for adults and to six months or less in the case of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 December 1997 my Department wrote to the participating agencies setting out the revised arrangements for the operation of the waiting list initiative in 1998.  The following revised arrangements now apply in respect of agencies in receipt <Col N="592" /> of funding for work on waiting lists: agencies were notified in their determination of net expenditure of the level of funding available to them; this has given agencies early notice of the money available and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly; the service plans should specify targets for waiting lists actively during the year; it is the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary; there will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than twelve months in the specialties targeted for attention; and agencies have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with the funding agency.</P>

      <P>Waiting times for mammograms vary between hospitals depending on the urgency of cases. Urgent appointments are seen as quickly as possible and while the demand for mammograms is high, hospitals make every effort to cater for women seeking appointments as soon as possible. Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of mammography services and I am strongly committed to developing mammography services in the context of the national cancer strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from telecommunications masts associated with mobile phone systems.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with which my Department liaises on the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.  Research and studies in this area are carried out on an ongoing basis and medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications companies operating here are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association in co-operation with the World Health Organisation in 1988.  These levels were reviewed in 1996 by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, an independent scientific body, which endorsed the levels set. Measurements taken here show that emission levels are well below the recommended safety limits.</P>
      <P>The Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation established by the Minister for Public Enterprise monitors licensed operators of telecommunications systems to ensure compliance with all the conditions of their licence, including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.</P>

      <P>As explained to the Deputy in response to his previous question of 24 February, 1998, the officer concerned has exhausted her entitlements to sick pay.  My Department is not this officer's direct employer and for this reason no records regarding her entitlements under the relevant Superannuation Act are maintained by my <Col N="596" /> Department.  However, officers of my Department made inquiries on her behalf and have been informed that if this officer chooses to resign on the grounds of ill health, subject to the approval of the North-Western Health Board, she would receive an additional seven years 100 days' service which would bring her service up to twenty years.  Based on this, the officer concerned would receive a lump sum of £11,000 and an annual allowance of £3,750.50. However, the officer concerned should be advised to contact the North-Western Health Board for advice on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 292 together.  The current policy adopted by the health services in relation to the care of older people as outlined in the Department's 1988 publication, The Years Ahead, is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and when this is no longer possible, to ensure they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People, the statutory advisory group set up to advise the Government on all matters affecting older people, recently published a comprehensive review of how this policy is being implemented. The review identified a number of areas where the level of services currently being provided were less than adequate, including care in the home.</P>
      <P>There is clearly a need to improve the level of services provided to older people in the home by nurses, nursing attendants, home helps and by a range of paramedical staff such as physiotherapists and speech therapists.  In addition, carers of older people need to be better supported and respite and day care facilities need to be expanded. I am endeavouring to boost these services as resources permit and, in this regard, the financial allocations to health boards for 1998 made provision for the opening of additional respite and day care facilities and the employment of additional paramedical and nursing staff to support older people in their homes.</P>
      <P>The provision of respite beds is a vital part of the support services for carers.  Respite beds are now provided as an integral part of all new extended care facilities being constructed by health boards.  Priority has also been given in 1998 to develop specialist mental health services for older people, which was one of the short-comings identified by the council.</P>
      <P>I should also say that a full review of the home help scheme by a team of independent researchers will be completed this summer.  When I have received the report, I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help scheme.  In relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the overall thrust of policy is to provide the necessary supports to enable them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. This year, additional resources have been provided for the development of services such as respite care, day care and home supports, including personal assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a substantial investment in the development of services to persons with a mental handicap in recent years.  Particular attention has <Col N="598" /> been paid in developing services to the provision of support services for persons with a mental handicap living at home with their families so that individuals can continue to live in the community for as long as possible.  In addition to the provision of new day services, additional respite care facilities have been put in place and the home support services, which were initiated in 1992, have been enhanced and expanded.  The home support services are intended to provide assistance to persons with a mental handicap and their families in a flexible manner and are designed to meet their individual circumstances.  It is proposed to continue to expand and enhance both the respite care and the home support services for persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In planning the future development of services for older people, I will take into account the views expressed at the Crosscare conference and the suggestions of the similar groups which organise invaluable support for carers.</P>

However, the board has established multi-disciplinary admission committees and these committees meet weekly to facilitate admissions to health board extended care facilities. In this way, general practitioner referrals to the committee are dealt with speedily and in an equitable way.

      <P>These revisions appear to represent a significant departure from the proposals envisaged in the national cancer strategy, which have been generally welcomed and are being implemented in other health board areas.</P>

      <P>My Deparment's overall policy objective in relation to the year 2000 issue is that health agencies ensure that there are no adverse effects or interruption to services which are provided to health service clients with the advent of the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing the issue of year 2000 my Department has, to date, taken a range of measures.  As a first step the chief executive officers and management of all health agencies were fully advised of the issue and requested to nominate staff to liaise with the Department.  This advice was followed up with information seminars which considered the year 2000 problem for the health service in general, and in particular, its implications in relation to information technology and medical devices.  It is intended that further information seminars will be held.  My Department has instructed health agencies to accord high priority to the year 2000 problem and will shortly issue guidelines to each health agency which will provide a recommended approach to dealing with the problem.  Allied to the foregoing, my Department <Col N="602" /> monitors progress within the health agencies on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of the year 2000 problem, health agencies are not yet in a position to establish accurate estimates of the total cost of dealing with the problem.  To date, much of the work relating to year 2000 within agencies has been of an investigative and action planning nature undertaken by health agency staff as part of their normal duties.  However, I have allocated an additional £5 million to the 1998 capital programme to assist with the year 2000 problem. Funding requirements will be kept under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dangers of smoking and its detrimental effect on human health have been clearly established in numerous scientific studies carried out by reputable medical and scientific bodies, including the World Health Organisation, over the last thirty years.  Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and coronary heart disease.  In Ireland about 6,000 deaths a year are directly attributable to smoking.  Smoking is a major causative factor in almost 90 per cent of the 1,500 deaths from lung cancer which occur here annually and it increases the risk of other cancers such as those of the mouth and throat.  Smoking is also a major risk factor in cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland.  Stopping smoking is one of the most immediate and worthwhile contributions anyone can make to the improvement of health, both on an individual and on a collective level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Studies carried out internationally in recent years on the health risks from environmental tobacco smoke have confirmed that there is also a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker from passive smoking.  As more and more evidence emerges of the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke, including the increased <Col N="605" /> risk of lung cancer, there is growing public demand for a smoke-free environment.  Legislation was introduced in 1996 which extended the environmental controls on smoking to a wide range of public areas and facilities to help protect people from the dangers of passive smoking.</P>
    <P>I am currently conducting a general review of smoking and health policy and I have set up a group to advise and report to me.  I hope to be in a position to announce a number of initiatives in this area over the coming months.  The litigation issue is also being looked at by this advisory group and officials are monitoring the situation in the United States and other jurisdictions.  When I make a final determination on this matter I will issue a statement.</P>

      <P>Roaccutane &mdash; isotretinoin &mdash; is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne.  In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments.  Its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist.  The current data sheet on the product contains the warnings that mood swings may occur, including precipitation of depression.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has been actively monitoring data on roaccutane which it has reviewed both internally with experts and with the other European regulatory agencies.  In addition, it has also reviewed the matter with the company and has now finalised revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions.  The warnings will refer to possible side effects, including depression, psychotic symptoms and rarely suicide having been reported with roaccutane.  The revised warnings are currently being incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company will within the next week circularise all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of roaccutane.  As with all medicines, it is important that patients should read carefully any information and follow any instructions provided with the medication and consult with their physicians in relation to any problems, side effects or uncertainties they may encounter.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, stipulates that in order to effect a foreign adoption, prospective adopters must have a declaration from the Adoption Board that it is satisfied that they are eligible and suitable persons to adopt and, that in making such a declaration, the Adoption Board must have regard to an assessment report by the health board in which the prospective adopters are ordinarily resident or a registered adoption society.  While a domestic adoption assessment will obviously examine many of the matters pertinent to a foreign adoption assessment, there are, given the cultural issues involved, a number of additional matters which must be examined in assessing applicants for a foreign adoption and a health board would wish to assess applicants in respect of these matters even if they have already been approved for a domestic adoption by a registered adoption society or by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider that an essential component of a quality service to hospital patients would be the availability of systems at hospital level to investigate complaints in a courteous and speedy manner. A charter of rights for hospital patients was introduced in August 1992.  It provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis in law, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patients and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the charter makes specific reference to complaints, as follows:</P>
      <P>You have the right to complain about any aspect of hospital service, to have the complaint investigated, and to be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Your hospital has detailed procedures in place and should publicise these prominently throughout the hospital, together with the name and telephone number of the hospital's designated Complaint's Officer.  You have the right, where your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction, to have the matter referred to the hospital's Complaints Committee.</P>
      <P>The hospital's complaints procedures are without prejudice to your statutory rights to complain to the Ombudsman, the Medical Council, or An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also wish to know that my predecessor established a group for the purpose of drawing up guidelines, upon which hospitals-institutions can base protocols for dealing with allegations of abuse by staff in health care institutions. <Col N="608" /> The group included representatives of the clinical professions involved, the management of voluntary and health board hospitals and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Department has recently circulated these draft guidelines to interested parties for comment before 30 June 1998.  The guidelines will then be published and forwarded to all health-care institutions, which will then use the guidelines to draw up their own detailed protocols.  My Department is committed to the further development of patient advocacy systems throughout the acute sector.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the queues for services outside the registration offices located at Joyce House, 8-11 Lombard Street East, Dublin 2, have been considerable in recent times and I regret the inconvenience to the persons concerned.  The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir &mdash; Registrar-General &mdash; of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the Superintendent Registrar, Dublin &mdash; and Registrars &mdash; who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's Office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and &mdash; Roman Catholic &mdash; marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office in particular is currently experiencing a very high level of demand for certificates which is the primary cause of the long queues outside the building.</P>
      <P>Measures have been taken to improve the situation. The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the Superintendent Registrar's Office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street.  However, I understand that it will take some weeks to occupy and commission the new offices.  In the interim the board has taken steps to improve staffing levels in the Superintendent Registrar's Office in order to redress the problem. The additional staff has increased the rate of production of certificates and this has reduced the size of the queues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has made accommodation available in Joyce House to enable Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages to vacate Room 1.1 on the ground floor of that office with effect from 25 May 1998.  The registrars have moved to more <Col N="609" /> spacious accommodation which will ensure a greater level of privacy and comfort for persons registering births and deaths.  This move will facilitate the extension of the waiting area in the Superintendent Registrar's Office on the ground floor.  I understand that some minor structural alterations will be required and that these will be carried out as soon as possible.  These measures will considerably improve matters for the public attending at Joyce House.</P>

Four hundred and ninety-five residential places have been put in place since then.  It will not be possible to identify how many of these young people have received their residential placement until the national intellectual disability database is updated later this year.

    <P>The waiting time between date of application and commencement of works varies considerably between each application.

Non urgent cases are placed on a waiting list and are undertaken as resources allow.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of applicants in Mayo who have paid contributions and are awaiting the commencement of works is 53.  Contributions made by individuals are lodged to the board's account and are not, as such, accounted for separately within the board's banking system which operates within a sanctioned overdraft limit.  The money is credited against expenditure incurred on the scheme and an income-expenditure statement on this account is included with the board's annual financial statements.  The earning of interest by the board does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board has advised me that current funding available for special housing aid for the elderly will allow for completion of 344 jobs.  This will leave 1,610 on the waiting list until further funding becomes available.  The decision with regard to any such further funding is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>The criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements are specified in the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996.  Before granting an agreement the chief executive officer must be satisfied that there is a definite public health need, as defined in the regulations, for the supply of community pharmacy services in the particular catchment area.  Under the regulations, an assessment board is established by the chief executive officer to evaluate this matter and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>
      <P>I made inquiries with the Western Health Board and I understand that on foot of an application for a community pharmacy contractor agreement in Knock last year, the assessment board established to look at this matter recommended that there was not a definite public health need for a community pharmacy in Knock. The chief executive officer subsequently informed the applicants by letter on 19 February 1998 that, further to the assessment board's recommendation and examination of the applications, a pharmacy contract could not be granted.  I should add that where an application has been refused by a chief executive officer on grounds that a definite public health need has not been established, an applicant may appeal in writing to me, under article 10 of the regulations, within a period of twenty one days from the date of notification by the chief executive officer. However, I did not receive any appeal from the applicants following communication of the chief executive officer's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ventolin is the brand name for a range of medicinal products containing Salbutamol, all of which are intended for the treatment of the various forms of asthma, where the relief of bronchospasm is indicated.  Salbutamol, which is the active ingredient in all of these products, is a bronchodilator which must be used under medical supervision.  This supervision is particularly important for these products because of their propensity for use over prolonged periods and at higher dosage levels.  The classification assigned to this range of bronchodilator products in this country facilitates this essential supervision, which is in the interest of protecting public health.</P>
      <P>The legal classification of medicinal products on the market is the subject of ongoing review in consultation with the Irish Medicines Board.  In addition to their safety profile, consideration is also given to the legal classifications assigned to the various medicinal products in the other member states of the European Union.  While the position, where legal classification is concerned, has not yet been harmonised, the position in this country is not significantly different from that pertaining in other member states where the law is concerned.</P>
      <P>The position in Ireland in relation to products containing Salbutamol is that the prescription may be repeated by the pharmacist for up to six months after its date of issue.  In some member states, there is no such facility for a repeat supply. Ireland's position on the control of medicinal products containing Salbutamol is wholly consistent with Resolution AP (95) 1 of the Council of Europe, which recommends a prescription only classification with a facility that the supply may be repeated for up to six months.  Under this Resolution, the classifications shown are to be considered as minimum requirements.  Countries, therefore, may apply stricter rules in any given case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system governing the pricing of medicines differs from country to country.  As for any other commodity, the price of prescription medicines is influenced by a range of variables, including historical factors, social factors and the relative demand for the products in question. The system of pricing of medicines in this country has been determined by means of successive agreements between the Department of <Col N="614" /> Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.  The current agreement which covers the period 1 August 1997 to 31 July 2002 includes the following elements: provides that the price to the wholesaler of any new item of prescription medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted United Kingdom wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower; and provides for a price freeze for existing drugs and medicines for the duration of the agreement.  The arrangements in place under this agreement have resulted in a stabilisation of prices in Ireland as compared with the rest of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308, 315 and 317 together.  It is important to outline the change that has taken place in pre-registration nursing education and training.  The traditional apprenticeship model has been replaced by the nursing registration-diploma programme.  As a result, the concept of a student nurse as a salaried employee of a relevant health agency no longer applies in the case of students participating in the diploma based programme.  Such students are affiliated to a third level institute and have student status only.  Nursing students are, therefore, supernumerary and are not paid a salary, but receive a package of financial supports, including an annual maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>I recently approved a package of enhanced financial supports for students participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes, including a 20 per cent increase in their annual maintenance grant.  The total extra cost of these improved supports in 1998 alone is in the region of £1 million. I emphasise that students participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students.  Each student receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  The grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is £1,624 per annum.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the students' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf.  The average annual fee is about £1,300.  A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 are also provided for each student commencing the diploma programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.  In addition, a new allowance of £20 per week was recently introduced to assist students undertaking external placements.  This is payable where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement.  Students undertaking such placements who do not require accommodation receive a free weekly travel pass. The average annual total value of these supports is some £6,000 per student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume Deputy Shortall is referring to the one year full time degree course which University College Galway is offering to students who have successfully completed the first general nursing registration-diploma programme which was introduced in 1994.  The position is that successful completion by a student of the three year nursing registration-diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse.  Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification <Col N="616" /> would be an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees.  I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing in its interim report had identified a number of issues relating to pre-registration nursing education and training, which it is expected to address in its final report.  I consider that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the deliberations of the commission before contemplating any changes in the present arrangements, which are in compliance with the rules of An Bord Altranais and the relevant EU Directives.</P>

      <P>A sum £16 million additional revenue and capital funding was made available in 1998 for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Of this £742,000 additional revenue funding was allocated to the Western Health Board for the development of new services to persons with a mental handicap.  A sum of £5.25 million capital funding has been made available as part of the £30 million capital programme for services to persons with a mental handicap which I announced late last year.  The capital programme will run over four years in tandem with An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 and is essential to ensure that the necessary physical infrastructure is in place to enable the new residential, respite and day services to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards, in conjunction with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees, are currently finalising proposals for capital projects in the context of the capital programme. I understand the Western Health Board has included the refurbishment of Tig Ronan in its proposals for priority capital expenditure in 1998. As all the proposals from the health boards have not yet been submitted to my Department, decisions on the allocation of capital funding to the health boards in 1998 have not yet been taken.  The precise services to be put in place in each health board area from the additional revenue and capital funding is a matter for the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees. <Col N="617" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 319 and 320 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative recommended that, to maximise its effectiveness, implementation of the proposed Dublin port tunnel should be accompanied by traffic management measures, including tolling. The statutory power to levy tolls on the proposed route, to make toll by-laws, or to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the <Col N="619" /> Roads Act, 1993, and I understand that the NRA is at present considering a toll scheme on the lines recommended by the DTI.</P>
    <P>However, before a toll could be imposed, a number of procedures would have to be complied with.  These include formal consultation with the elected members of the local authority, the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Where objections are made to a toll scheme, a public inquiry must be held before a decision can be taken by the Minister. No toll scheme in respect of the route in question has yet been made and, accordingly, the question of an inquiry does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323, 324 and 325 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 519 of 21 April 1998 which gives details of rents payable under the rental subsidy scheme which is administered by local authorities in their areas.  Under the scheme, the rent payable to an approved body by a tenant of a house qualifying for subsidy is based on household and subsidiary income in the tax year preceding the subsidy year.  Household income for the purposes of the scheme is the total income of the tenant and his-her spouse &mdash; if any &mdash; or of joint tenants, as the case may be, and does not exclude bonus, overtime, shift rate and other lump sum payments.  There is no maximum on the rent payable on household income. However, the contribution to the rent by each subsidiary earner is subject to a maximum of £20 per week.  Approved voluntary bodies are responsible for the maintenance and management of their houses and the terms of the scheme do not preclude a separate administration charge by a body.</P>

      <P>Local authorities carry out assessments of homelessness alongside their periodic statutory assessments of housing need.  The next assessment is due in March 1999.  Before carrying out an assessment, local authorities liaise with the voluntary bodies providing accommodation and services for homeless people in their areas and with the health boards with a view to ensuring that the assessment is as complete and comprehensive as possible.  I am conscious of the need to <Col N="621" /> improve the reliability of these assessments and will be paying special attention to this in the preparation of the guidelines to be issued later this year to local authorities in regard to the assessment. In view of the greater scale of homelessness in the Dublin region, I am consulting the Dublin Homeless Initiative, which represents voluntary bodies and local authorities in the Dublin region, in relation to the guidelines for the assessment and the question of whether a separate assessment of homelessness is warranted in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>All development requires planning permission unless specifically exempted under the Planning Acts and regulations.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, both the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast and the replacement of an existing mast by licensed operators are, subject to certain criteria, restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antennae and compliance with certain emission standards, exempted development.</P>
      <P>Except in the case of exempted development, a person wishing to erect a new mast or attach antennae to an existing mast must obtain planning permission from the relevant planning authority and anyone may comment on that application. The decision of the planning authority may also be appealed to An Bord Pleanála either by the applicant or by a third party or both.  In considering appeals against decisions by planning authorities to grant or to refuse planning permission, An Bord Pleanála is restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority, including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof, regard being had to the provisions of the development plan and the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the said area.  While, the board may grant a planning permission for a development which would contravene materially a development plan, in practice such decisions are rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures in Part XIII of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, apply to development for the purposes of or in connection with the operations of An Garda Síochána.  This procedure provides for public consultation involving the publication of a newspaper notice, erection of a site notice and the making available for public inspection of a document describing the development, a location <Col N="624" /> map and plans or drawings describing the external appearance of the proposed development.  In deciding whether a proposed development is to be carried out, regard must be had to any submissions or observations made.</P>
    <P>My Department issued guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures in July 1996.  These are intended to assist both planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála as well as operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures within the planning system.  A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.  I have no proposals to issue additional guidelines to the board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of its application for funding under the remedial works scheme Meath County Council accorded the highest priority to Claremount Estate, Navan, which has been approved for funding under the scheme at an estimated cost of more than £5 million.  My Department is in communication with officials of the county council about design aspects of their proposals for the refurbishment of the houses at St. Mary's Villas, Donore, the estimated cost of which is some £700,000.</P>

      <P>The impact of the year 2000 issue on IT systems in my Department is being addressed under a specific plan, and work on implementing the plan is ongoing in the Department.  The estimated cost of necessary remedial measures is around £200,000, the greater part of which is as yet unexpended.  This amount does not include the cost of time spent on this work by departmental staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are by far the largest group of bodies under my Department's aegis, and the Local Government Computer Services Board &mdash; LGCSB &mdash; are playing a pro-active role in relation to year 2000 compliance in the local government sector.  The estimated cost of <Col N="627" /> remedial measures for IT systems in use by local authorities and developed and maintained by the LGCSB is about £350,000, of which some £200,000 has been expended to date.</P>
    <P>The other bodies under the aegis of my Department have been asked to report on the implications of the year 2000 issue for their IT systems and on the steps being taken to ensure compliance. The Department will be assessing their responses.  I do not at this stage have estimates of the costs to date or anticipated costs in these agencies.</P>

    <P>Considerable progress is being made in improving the quality and quantity of wheelchair accessible taxis.  It is a matter for the local authorities concerned, in the first instance, to monitor the adequacy of service to the disabled <Col N="628" /> community arising from the new arrangements now being operated, and if necessary to suggest regulatory changes to my Department.  At this stage, no such proposals have been made to my Department by any local authority or group representative of people with disabilities. However the Irish Council for People with Disabilities has recently made a submission to the Dublin Taxi Forum which is seeking to develop a shared vision for the improvement of taxi services in the area.  I will have regard to the recommendations of the forum when they become available.</P>

      <P>Section 20 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, requires planning authorities to review their development plans every five years.  Section 19(2) of the 1963 Act, as amended, sets out the objectives which must be addressed by a local authority in drawing up its development plan and the additional objectives, as set out in the Third Schedule to the Act, which may be addressed in the plan if the authority so wishes.  It is a matter for local authorities themselves, in addresing the objectives to be included in their development plan, to consider what would be the most appropriate planning time frame in relation to each objective, having regard to the proper planning and development of their area.  These objectives can then be reviewed as part of the ongoing five yearly review.</P>

      <P>Work is well under way on the Dublin water conservation project. The project consists of three elements, a leakage reduction programme, network rehabilitation works and the provision of water conservation infrastructure.  All three elements have started. The main element of the project deals with leakage reduction.  The initial phase of this element, consisting of preparatory work in relation to district metering, pressure control and water audit of leakage levels, has been completed together with the installation and replacement of bulk water meters.  Leakage control terms have been established and are carrying out work for first identify and then reduce water leakage throughout the region.</P>

      <P>Generally membership of an occupational pension scheme is linked to a person's employment.  Accordingly, if a person leaves his or her employment in Ireland to work in another European country he or she would not be entitled to pay into that scheme while working abroad.  However if the person is posted to work for that company in another European country he/she may be allowed to continue accuring benefits under the Irish scheme subject to the rules of the particular scheme and to satisfying the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, preservation of benefits related to service subsequent <Col N="635" /> to 1 January 1991 is compulsory, subject to the member having completed at least five years qualifying service, at least two of which fall after 1 January 1991.  Where there is mandatory preservation of benefits, refunds of contribution may only apply in respect of payments made prior to 1 January 1991.  Payment of such refunds would also be subject to the rules of the particular scheme.  Persons with personal pension policies, which relate to those in self employment or in non pensionable employment, are prohibited from paying premiums while abroad because they are obliged to have a source of income chargeable to Irish tax.  The only refunds that could be payable to those persons would be in respect of premiums mistakenly made when abroad.</P>
    <P>Generally, in relation to Irish people working both in Ireland itself and in Europe, I am in favour of maximum flexibility with regard to their occupational pensions, subject of course, to adequate safeguards being in place.  In that regard I would specifically draw the Deputy's attention to two ongoing initiatives.  First, there is a proposal at European Union level for a Council directive on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the European Union.  This would, <i>inter alia,</i> provide for preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another in relation to their occupational pension; it also provides for posted workers to be allowed stay in their occupational schemes at home and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
    <P>Second, there are the proposals in &lsquo;Securing Retirement Income&rsquo;.  The report relating to the National Pensions Policy Initiative recently presented to me by the Pensions Board.  Among the many recommendations the board makes is the introduction of a personal retirement savings account &mdash; PRSA &mdash; which they consider would facilitate a major simplification of the regulatory and legal structures that exist at present.  This PRSA would not be directly linked to employment either at home or abroad and could deal with the situation referred to by the Deputy.  The Government has accepted, in principle, the board's proposals regarding a PRSA and will give consideration to the proposals in this regard as part of its next legislative cycle.  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind I would be happy to have the matter investigated if he would forward me the details.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age; have at least 156 contributions paid; and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions &mdash; or 24 in the case of a retirement pension &mdash; registered since January 1953 &mdash; when the unified system of social insurance came into effect &mdash; or the time they started insurable employment, if later. The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into effect from 21 November 1997.  To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphans pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>The person concerned currently receives a reduced rate old age non-contributory pension of £65.50 per week, based on means of £13.50 primarily derived from share investments.  He is also in receipt of a living alone allowance of £6 per week and a fuel allowance of £5 per week from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>On 6 March 1998 the person concerned requested a review of his entitlement to pension on the grounds that his circumstances had changed.  Following this review, he was assessed with weekly means of £223.89, derived mainly from shares and some other savings.  As this calculated value exceeds the statutory limit of £70 per week for entitlement to pension, he is no longer entitled to an old age non-contributory pension.  The capital value of this shares and other capital held and increased from £6,785.64 in November 1996 to £89,600.76 by April 1998.  The method of assessment of means from capital is specified in the Social Welfare Acts.  Under the assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent in order to determine the yearly value of savings and investments, and hence the weekly means.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned is disputing the facts used as the basis of means assessment, the matter has been referred back to a local officer of my Department for clarification with him.  On receipt of the local officer's report a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome without delay.  However, even on the basis of the lower share amount claimed by the person concerned, his net weekly means are likely to remain over the statutory limit for pension entitlement.</P>

      <P>Since its establishment in 1975, the Coolock Community Law Centre &mdash; CCLC &mdash; has been funded from a variety of sources, including the Department of Justice, the Eastern Health Board and the Combat Poverty Agency.  This matter was taken over directly by my Department in 1994 and an annual grant of £100,000 was provided from 1994 to 1996 inclusive. Under new procedures introduced in 1997, applications for funding from a number of organisations providing, <i>inter alia,</i> welfare rights and information services are considered in consultation with the National Social Service Board &mdash; NSSB.  Grants of £136,000 and up to £160,000 have been approved for 1997 and 1998 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Coolock Communty Law Centre is one of many organisations funded through various grant schemes administered by my Department.

      <P>The main recommendations from the Crosscare carer's convention that falls within my direct area of responsibility relates to the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose income fall below certain limits.  At the end of last December 10,330 people were in <Col N="640" /> receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £37 million in 1997.  Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is being increased from next month by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50, for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66, from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
    <P>In addition, the budget also provided for three additional improvements for carers.  The first two of these are of a more technical nature and benefit a small number of people.  These improvements are a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the payment of carer's allowance for six weeks after death to carers whose spouses were not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The third improvement is the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right.</P>
    <P>As part of my commitment to improve the supports for carers, I have recently reviewed the operation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care-recipient with full-time care and attention and have decided to adopt a more flexible approach.  Carers may now attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities for around ten hours per week provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care-recipient in his or her absence.  Government policy has placed an increasing emphasis on the role of community care in supporting the vast majority of people who wish to remain in their own homes and in their own communities.  The informal caring which carers provide is crucial in this context.</P>
    <P>In its An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, an interdepartmental working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, has been set up to review the carer's allowance.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.</P>
    <P>As this review is still ongoing, it is not possible at this stage to outline any possible recommendations which might be made to develop the carer's allowance.  However, the issues raised at the Crosscare Carers Convention have been received by the working group and will be addressed as part of the review process.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year. Further developments will be considered, in a budgetary context, in the light of that review. <Col N="641" /></P>

In assessing means, account is taken of the parent's gross income less income tax, PRSI, superannuation, private health insurance, union fees, rent or mortgage payments and some travel costs. Those who establish a minimum entitlement to unemployment assistance are approved for the purposes of the scheme and are issued with the relevant job certificate.  I should mention that students in receipt of higher education maintenance grants or whose parent's sole source of income is a social welfare payment will automatically qualify under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The position is that the social welfare secondary benefits, which comprise the free fuel allowance and butter vouchers as well as the Christmas bonus, are payable only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments. Since former community employment, CE, workers who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit after their period of community employment finishes are in receipt of a short-term payment, they are accordingly ineligible for the social welfare secondary benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation arises as a consequence of the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment, workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  The purposes of this <Col N="643" /> measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to place them on a par with other insured workers in terms of both insurance benefits and liabilities.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension, treatment (dental and optical) benefits and occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements along the lines suggested by the Deputy without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would have cost implications and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The group referred to in the Deputy's question applied for a grant under my Department's 1997 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations.  This scheme is one of a number of schemes operated by my Department which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>The groups supported through these schemes are typically involved in a range of projects which may include home management programmes, advice services, self-development programmes, community education, leadership skills, etc. Under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, under which the group made their application, grants may be made to groups who fulfil the overall criteria, for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once off publications or research or other special projects.  The group in question submitted an application under this scheme in 1997 seeking funding of £4,000 towards the cost of various items.</P>
      <P>From the application the overall focus of the group appeared to be that of a tenant management group involved in environmental enhancement, lobbying on behalf of local residents, acting as an intermediary between tenants and Dublin Corporation and also as a sponsor for a community employment scheme through which local people were enhancing their office and environmental improvement skills.

They are also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions.  In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.  Widows and widowers may also be eligible for a fuel allowance subject to satisfying a means test.</P>
      <P>In addition, this year's budget has provided that people, who are in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension and who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions, for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions, will retain their entitlement to the free schemes.  This measure extends the arrangement whereby invalidity pensioners, who transfer either to retirement pension at age 65 or to widow's widower's contributory pension at age 60 or over, retain their free schemes.</P>

      <P>While I accept that some level of poaching takes place I have no evidence that there is a particularly high level of poaching of deer at the moment.  There have been some isolated reports of the hunting of deer with lurcher dogs.  Anit-poaching controls are operated by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and where evidence of illegal activity is established, prosecutions have been and will be brought against those involved.</P>
      <P>While precise figures are not available, best indications are that poaching has declined rather than increased in recent years and such illegal activity, while unwelcome, does not pose a threat to the conservation status of the deer population.</P>
      <P>I appeal to those with any evidence of deer poaching or other illegal activity involving deer to make such evidence available to Dúchas andor the Garda Síochána so that prosecutions can be brought against those involved in this type of activity.</P>

      <P>The proposed Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) were selected from the former areas of scientific interest (ASIs) following field surveys to ascertain which of these continued to have a special wildlife interest.  The lands in question were not included in the ASI inventory, and therefore were not looked at in the context of the NHA programme.  Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has no scientific information regarding these lands and if the Deputy can provide such details of the fauna and flora referred to in his question, Dúchas will assess the matter with a view to arranging a site visit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>There is a contractual agreement with Esat Digifone allowing it to install mobile telephony equipment at specified Garda stations subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include a requirement that Esat Digifone complies fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Should any doubt arise in this regard it would be a matter for the relevant planning authority to consider.  In this regard, I understand that the proposed developments at each of the Garda stations mentioned by the Deputy will require planning permission.  Residents in each of these areas will, therefore, have the opportunity to voice their objections to the relevant planning authorities at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The proposal by Esat Digifone to locate its equipment on Garda sites was approved by the previous Government, subject, <i>inter alia,</i> to the conditions outlined above being complied with. In return, Digifone is paying full commercial rent for access to the sites and providing certain services to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that, for the purpose of maintaining contact with operational gardaí on the beat or in patrol cars, a radio based communications system must be used.  Where radio signals have to be transmitted over a wide area, it is necessary to elevate the transmitter by using masts, hilltop sites or high buildings.  Satellite technology is not, and will not in the foreseeable future, be suitable for Garda communication requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has no function in relation to the activities of commercial operators such as Esat Digifone or Telecom Éireann.  This is a matter for the Department of Public Enterprise and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation which licenses them and has overall responsibility for the provision of mobile telephony services on a nationwide basis.  I would <Col N="654" /> also point out that An Garda Síochána has no arrangement with Telecom Éireann which allows them access to Garda masts or sites.  In so far as the erection of new masts is concerned, the decision of the previous Government to allow Esat Digifone access to Garda sites was borne out of a desire, among other things, to avoid a proliferation of such masts and to promote the sharing of masts by different operators, as recommended in the Department of the Environment and Local Government guidelines for planning authorities concerning telecommunications antennae and support structures.  In so far as future developments of this sort are concerned, any decision reached would take full account of public concern.</P>

      <P>As an extension of a fundamental review of the information technology requirements of my Department last year, a year 2000 impact and strategy study of the Department's IT systems was carried out earlier this year.  This report, which encompassed the Department's head office, prisons, courts and associated offices was completed at the end of March at a total cost of £19,200.  It examined all systems, hardware, software and environments in use in the Department.  The report confirms that the Department's systems are not at a high risk of substantial failure due to the Department's <Col N="657" /> policy of replacement of older legacy systems, which is being implemented at present.</P>
      <P>In relation to hardware components, an inventory of all equipment has been carried out and assessed.  The inventory identified a very small number of items which are not compliant. In addition the Department's replacement policy means that many items will be replaced before the end of 1999.  My Department will ensure that all new purchases are compliant. The report does identify some specific work to be carried out on systems and environments in order to make them year 2000 compliant.  The estimated incremental cost of this work is estimated at £65,000 and my Department is currently working on the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>The progress to date in relation to the other agencies under my aegis is given below.</P>
      <P>Garda</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that work in relation to making their systems year 2000 compliant is well advanced and the subject of ongoing analysis and review.  The estimated cost of making systems which fall outside the scope of the Police Using Leading Systems Effectively Project (PULSE) year 2000 compliant is £347,000, of which £5,000 has been expended to date.  The PULSE project will replace the existing Garda mainframe systems which have year 2000 difficulties associated with them.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Registrar of Titles that in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds initial assessment and remedial work in relation to year 2000 compliance commenced in February 1997. At this stage, a business impact assessment and full analysis of remedial requirements has been carried out in respect of each system and category of equipment.  This work has established that the bulk of office equipment is already compliant and that a simple upgrade will be required from manufacturers in respect of some other equipment. It will be necessary to replace a small number of older items of equipment.  It is intended that compliance will be achieved by the end of 1998 in respect of all IT systems which are being retained.</P>
      <P>All assessment and remedial work to date has been conducted by in-house personnel at an estimated cost of £31,000.  The costs directly attributable to the year 2000 compliance programme in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds have been estimated at £142,000.  This includes hardware and software elements, third party services and internal staff costs.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board</P>
      <P>To date £41,599 has been spent on upgrading computer hardware.  A further £144,983 will be spent on upgrading computer hardware and software to ensure year 2000 compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> The Forensic Science Laboratory</P>
    <P>To date £5,000 has been spent on upgrading computer hardware and software.  It is anticipated that a further £3,000 to £4,000 will be spent to ensure that all systems are year 2000 compliant.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while their computer data for 1990 indicate that no member was convicted of common assault that year, computer data relating to disciplinary matters prior to 1991 may not be fully complete.  To ensure the absolute accuracy of a definitive statement about cases in 1990, therefore, all discipline files for that year and some earlier years would have to be examined manually.  This would require a disproportionate <Col N="660" /> expenditure of Garda time and resources which could not be justified.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce an instalment payment procedure in the District Court offices in relation to outstanding fines where petitions for mitigation of penalties imposed by courts exercising criminal jurisdiction are no longer accepted by his Department following the High Court judgment in April 1995.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court judgment in April 1995 on petitions restricted significantly, but not entirely, the powers of clemency which I may exercise in relation to penalties imposed by courts exercising criminal jurisdiction.  The judgment requires that the power of clemency be used sparingly and only in special cases and in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>At present, neither District Court offices nor gardaí may accept payment of fines in criminal cases by instalment.  This bar is a legal one since the law provides only for payment of a fine to be made in full to the court clerk by the due date. As regards the gardaí, payment by instalment is not permitted because, where a defendant failed to pay a later instalment, the committal warrant would be invalid.  A sizeable number of fines are paid in cash and it is also necessary to adhere to strict accounting procedures in handling fines receipts.  Payments by instalment would tend to weaken such control procedures significantly. However, arrangements are in place under which a defendant may request a court to allow an extension of time in which to pay a penalty.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering various proposals in relation to the payment of fines including a system of attachment of earnings whereby the court could order that outstanding fines be deducted from a person's earnings.  This would represent a form of payment by instalment.  I cannot say when an attachment of earnings Bill will be published. This will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Jurisdiction in relation to divorce lies with the Circuit Court and the High Court.</P>
      <P>In the Circuit Court the requirements for responding to civil bills under rules of court relating to divorce are basically similar to those in existence for responding to ordinary civil bills &mdash; if a respondent intends contesting a civil bill he-she is obliged to inform the court accordingly within ten days.  In many instances an extension of time outside the ten days is granted.  Following this the respondent has a further period of ten days to lodge a defence and this period may be extended by agreement between the parties or as allowed by the court.</P>
      <P>The originating procedure is slightly different in the High Court where a special summons is issued with a return date to the Master's Court inserted in the body of the summons.  This date must be at least seven days from the date of issue and in general it is well in excess of the minimum seven days, unless the parties insist on urgency.</P>
      <P>I do not consider, if the law is to be effective, that the procedures concerning such response periods, and their application, can be regarded as being unreasonable, but if the Deputy has a situation in mind which is the source of particular difficulty, I would be glad if she would write to me about it.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have primary responsibility for the provision and maintenance of courthouses in their respective areas. In 1990, the Government decided to make this Department financially responsible for the refurbishment of courthouses and that local authorities should act as our agents in this regard.</P>
      <P>Court sittings in Castleblayney have recently been transferred from the courthouse to a nearby hotel due to the very poor condition of the courthouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The space available in the courthouse at <Col N="665" /> Castleblayney is more than sufficient to meet the needs of the courts.  My Department will be taking this matter up with Monaghan County Council with a view to refurbishing the courthouse in partnership with other agencies who may wish to be involved in the project.</P>
    <P>With regard to Monaghan Courthouse, I understand that this building was refurbished in 1986 by Monaghan County Council following a fire in 1981.  Monaghan Courthouse currently accommodates the District and Circuit Courts and their offices, as well as a number of other agencies including, county council and health board staff.  My Department recently asked Monaghan County Council to provide additional office space in the courthouse to meet the requirements of the courts given the increase in the volume of court business since 1986 and imminent technology developments.  My Department is awaiting proposals from Monaghan County Council in this regard as they have the statutory responsibility to provide courthouse accommodation under the Courthouse (Maintenance and Provision) Act, 1935.</P>

      <P>The letters enclosed with the Deputy's question are similar in content to many letters received by me over the past number of months.  Indeed many Deputies have received similar letters which they in turn have passed to me.  This has resulted in a situation where I have received two, three or even four copies of the same latter from the same letter writer.  Such letters would appear to form part of a write-in campaign. I have my doubts about the benefits of such a procedure when the end results is that I have to assign staff to replying to such correspondence when this very staff would be better employed in helping to process the very significant backlog of asylum applications that currently exists.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the Deputy and all other interested parties I will set out the general contents of my replies to such letters.</P>
      <P>There appears to be some misconception among groups and individuals about the asylum process in this State.  Ireland fully lives up to its international obligations in the asylum area. People entitled under international law to protection are given protection.  Despite views to the contrary, we have a long and honourable tradition in this regard.  A corollary to the granting of protection to those in need of it is the fact that those found not to require protection must return to their countries of origin.  The UNHCR recognise this and is on record as stating that such returns are necessary to protect the integrity of the asylum process.  It may well happen that, in certain cases, persons who do not qualify for protection as refugees may be allowed to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice, have exercised our discretion in this regard where it has been appropriate to so do.</P>
      <P>A popular misconception is that UNHCR dictates what a country's asylum policy should be. This is not the case, it is Ireland as a sovereign state which decides how it will process claims for refugee status in accordance with its international obligations.  This is not to say that we do not take account of the views of the UNHCR, we do and we place great value on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of asylum seekers is an issue which requires great sensitivity.  One of the tasks of the UNHCR and NGOs is to heighten our awareness of the issues facing asylum seekers.  As a Government we have an obligation to hear what such organisations are saying and why they are saying it.  Government is not of course obliged to assume that everything that may be said is to be taken on board and acted upon without question. There is also the duty on Government to hear other points of view and to assess fully and as best it can where the truth lies, where the <Col N="667" /> needs are greatest and how needs &mdash; which sometimes can be quite conflicting &mdash; can best be met.</P>
    <P>I have approached the implementation of the procedures for processing claims to refugee status in this spirit.  I have listened, I have heard the different points of view, I have carefully assessed the propositions put to me, tried to find the right balance and have made my decisions.  In reaching my decisions I was conscious of the fact that provisions of the Refugee Act were unworkable, that the 1985 &ldquo;Von Arnim&rdquo; arrangement was outdated, that the UNHCR was no longer able to assist in assessing cases on an ongoing basis and that the UNHCR stated that a new interim procedural arrangement was necessary.  The new arrangements of 10 December followed closely the procedural provisions of the Refugee Act. Indeed, the &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; criteria are taken directly from section 12 of the Act.  Many people who have been particularly critical of these provisions have chosen to overlook this fact: in many cases the self-same people who laud the Refugee Act and seek to castigate the Government and myself for its non-implementation.</P>
    <P>I have continued to listen to the concerns of UNHCR and NGOs as is evidenced by the fact that I agreed to amend the procedures set out in the letter of 10 December 1997 following a meeting in February of this year.  The amendments met two particular concerns of these bodies and, as far as I am aware, the UNHCR are happy with the current arrangements as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>I must defend both the Government's and my own position regarding the treatment of asylum seekers in the State.  Since coming into Government, I have obtained Government approval to recruit an additional 72 staff to assist in processing applications for refugee status.  I am also arranging for a refugee legal service to be established which will provide free legal assistance to asylum seekers in presenting their asylum claims. In addition, I have made arrangements to have a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; for asylum seekers set up in Mount Street.  The new premises will house officials processing asylum applications, the appeals authorities, the UNHCR, the proposed refugee legal service and the Eastern Health Board's refugee unit.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new procedures are reasonable, fair, transparent and in accord with the philosophy of the Refugee Act.  They are also in accordance with our international obligations and humanitarian traditions in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 430, 431, 432, 433 and 434 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues reported to the Government in February.  It made a number of recommendations which were accepted by the <Col N="669" /> Government and which my Department is now advancing.  A summary of the committee's recommendations is set out in my reply to the Deputy's question of 7 May.</P>
    <P>Several representatives from five Government Departments participated in the work of the committee and my Department will continue to consult with other Departments and agencies in so far as the implementation of these proposals affects their activities or requires their involvement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation regarding the immigration of persons who do not need to come into contact with State services, many non-EU-EEA nationals are admitted to the State for, say, recreational, study or retirement purposes on the basis that they have sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay here and will not become a burden on the State.  Some such persons, particularly those in relation to whom there is no visa requirement, enter the State for apparently short-term purposes but end up settling permanently.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee identified as a deficiency in our present immigration law the inability to regulate such immigration.  Its proposal in this regard is under examination in my Department as part of the process of developing new immigration legislation, the aim of which is to provide a modern and effective basis for the implementation of immigration policy which, at the same time, respects the rights of the individual persons who come into contact with it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has expressed concern about medical aspects arising in regard to the recommendation that, when a new system of residence permits is in place, the providers of publicly funded services should notify my Department of applicants who do not have the appropriate documentation. I would like to make it clear that I do not favour and will not support any measures which would have an inhumane impact and, specifically, I do not envisage that the implementation of this recommendation will affect doctor-patient relationships.</P>
    <P>The committee also identified deportation procedures as among the aspects of immigration law which would need to be dealt with in the new legislation.  Work has commenced in my Department on the details of proposals for amending legislation.  In tandem with this, work is advancing on the preparation of amendments to the Aliens Orders made under the Aliens Act, 1935, which will include provisions to make more transparent the deportation process and the steps leading up to it, pending the introduction of the new legislation.  Details of the new legislation and of the amendments to the Aliens Orders will be announced in due course in the usual way.</P>
    <P>Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on provisions for inclusion in all illegal immigrants trafficking Bill which will give effect to the recommendation that legislation be put in place to criminalise trafficking in <Col N="670" /> illegal immigrants.  It is intended that these measures will be introduced as soon as possible. I assure the Deputy, however, that a person found entering the country in this way would not, for that reason, be debarred from the asylum process but would have his or her claim assessed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the issue of the conclusion of re-admission agreements with appropriate countries.  While it is too early to say how this matter will progress, my officials will be taking into account the provisions of Council recommendation of 30 November 1994 concerning a specimen bilateral re-admission agreement between a member state and a third country and Council recommendation of 24 July 1995 on the guiding principles to be followed in drawing up protocols on the implementation of re-admission agreements.  Details of both these recommendations are set out in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 19 September 1996 (OJ No. C 274).</P>

      <Quest>if he will undertake to satisfy himself in all cases that asylum seekers will be admitted to the asylum procedures in the EU country to which they are returned with regard to the return of asylum seekers to other EU countries; and if he will undertake that no asylum seekers will be returned to an EU state whose asylum procedures are deficient and where an asylum seeker might run the risk of being returned to their country of origin where they may face persecution.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy is obviously referring to the provisions of the Dublin Convention whereby an asylum seeker may be returned to another EU member state to have his or her asylum application considered.</P>
      <P>An underlying philosophy of the Dublin Convention is a basic confidence on the part of the member states in each other's procedures in relation to asylum law.  Although only of limited scope, the establishment of responsibility for examining applications for asylum implicitly presupposes that member states have mutual confidence in each other as one member state consents to an application for asylum lodged with it being processed by another member state in accordance with the latter's national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention's starting point is that it guarantees the member states' commitment to honour their obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees which specifically provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner to the frontiers of territories where life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a <Col N="671" /> particular social group or political opinion.  This prohibition of refoulement is given effect in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the survey Smoking, Alcohol and Drug Abuse in Cork and Kerry conducted by the Southern Health Board's department of public health and published in November 1997.  The survey contains numerous suggestions, one of which is that consideration should be given to increasing the legal age for the sale of alcohol to 21 years of age.  I look forward to the report on the review of the licensing laws being carried out by the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights who may have some initial guidance to offer on this particular aspect of the law.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to Questions Nos. 69 and 70 of 23 April 1998, I propose to consider generally the question of amending legislation on our licensing laws in the context, among other matters, of publication of the sub-committee's report.</P>

It is not my normal practice to comment on individual cases of refusal and I do not propose to depart from that practice on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for refugee status which were outstanding on 31 March 1998 was 5,175.  The corresponding figure for 31 March 1997 was 1,661.  It is not possible to state how many persons with refugee status were residing in the State on these dates: records in my Department are not maintained in such a way as to enable the information sought by the Deputy to be obtained.  However, I advise the Deputy that 282 persons were granted refugee status in the period 1 January 1994 to 31 March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the countries of origin of the persons concerned, it has been the general policy of successive Ministers not to disclose information on the nationality of asylum seekers or refugees. This is due to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics <Col N="674" /> were provided.  Such identification could have serious implications particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin. However, where there is a significant number of applications from certain countries of origin I am prepared to list those nationalities.  The main countries of origin of asylum seekers this past year are Algeria, Nigeria, Romania, Somalia and Zaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work to ensure that this Department and each agency within its remit is year 2000 compliant is ongoing.  My Department is providing two-monthly progress reports to the Government's Year 2000 Monitoring Committee on progress in the Department and the agencies under its aegis.  This committee was established in September 1997 to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT related systems and automated office equipment in Government Departments and in agencies under their remit.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to Bord Fáilte, CERT and ADM is as follows:</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has carried out a detailed survey of all its computer systems, hardware and software, and has identified three systems which have to be replaced.  This process of reviewing and evaluating alternative systems is in progress and the total process will be completed by end March 1999.  Bord Fáilte also carried out a comprehensive survey of all its non-computer equipment, for example, fax, telephone, lifts etc.  and has identified a number which will require further testing and possible upgrades.  The total cost of the work to date is £310,000 and an estimate of the outstanding work is £320,000 to replace non-compliant systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Cert</P>
    <P>Cert has set up an internal task group to ensure that year 2000 issues are dealt with effectively. Year 2000 issues are categorised into IT and non-IT.</P>
    <P>Non-IT:</P>
    <P>Cert has commissioned a report by its engineering consultants on aspects of compliance. The report will cover such issues as telephone, fax, alarms, pumps etc.  Provision has been made for up to £4,000 for the report with a further £20,000 for necessary changes for year 2000 compliance.</P>
    <P>Information Technology</P>
    <P>As a result of an IT strategy report in 1996, CERT commenced the upgrading of its IT systems. As part of this major investment, year 2000 compliance of all systems was a pre-requisite. Owing to the timing of the upgrade, no additional costs for the year 2000 were incurred for these elements.</P>
    <P>CERT needs to replace its accounting systems with year 2000 compliant systems.  Provision of at least £75,000 has been made for this upgrade. Detailed research has been carried out and tender documents are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>ADM</P>
    <P>The majority of equipment was purchased within the last two years which should ensure that all equipment is year 2000 compliant.  This Department has requested ADM to seek compliancy statements from the suppliers in question and to implement a testing programme.  The purchase of this equipment is viewed as an integral element of their IT strategy and not as an additional expense to accommodate the year 2000.  Testing procedures will be carried out internally and, therefore, no further cost is envisaged at this point.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the agencies under my aegis will be year 2000 compliant in good time.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a request was made by this school to have a special class set up to cater for the needs of children with Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD).</P>
      <P>Many children exhibiting less serious forms of the symptoms associated with ADD/ADHD are being successfully catered for within mainstream classes, with the support of the remedial teaching service.  The remedial service is being expanded on an ongoing basis and in the current school year there are a total of 1,242 remedial teachers in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>Where more pronounced forms of ADD/ADHD are involved, the children can be catered for in special schools or through support from the resource teacher or teacher-counsellor. There are at present 78 resource teacher posts and 27 teacher-counsellor posts allocated to primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed to maximum effect.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of children in the school to which he refers will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The topic of family planning is included in the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme as one of the themes for senior cycle. The topic is considered in the context of the broader issues around relationships and sexuality, which include helping young people: to acquire information on methods of family planning; to enable them to form attitudes and values around sexual activity within a moral and spiritual framework; to develop a broad range of personal and interpersonal skills such as assertiveness, communication, decision-making and critical awareness towards the facilitation of responsible behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RSE programme is a carefully balanced programme, and the themes in the programme are treated sensitively and in a manner most <Col N="682" /> appropriate to the circumstances applying in the senior cycle situation in schools.</P>
    <P>The programme is in the early stages of introduction into schools and I do not consider that it would be desirable to amend it at this time and, in so doing, to risk disturbing the careful balance which has been achieved over a number of years developing the programme.  However, the programme, like all other programmes introduced, will be carefully monitored over the introduction and implementation phase with a view to making any necessary adjustments or amendments in light of developments.</P>

      <P>In line with a Government decision of 30 September 1997, my Department has requested that bodies under its aegis address the year 2000 issue.  To this end a letter was sent to all the relevant agencies requesting that they address the issues involved, if they had not already done so, and submit their compliance plans to my Department.</P>
      <P>External consultants have been retained to assist with the assessment of the returns made by the agencies; to produce a detailed advice note on the issue; to design a questionnaire which will be of use to my Department in monitoring progress; and to prepare a report which would indicate problem areas and make recommendations on how these could be resolved.</P>
      <P>The questionnaire and accompanying advice note is currently being finalised and it is intended that the documentation will issue to the agencies in the near future.  The bodies will be requested to return the completed questionnaire and also to provide an update on information already supplied to my Department.  To assist them in this respect, information already supplied will be preprinted on the questionnaire forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates of the costs of ensuring that these agencies are fully compliant are not available at present but the agencies are being asked to provide these details on the questionnaire. <Col N="686" /></P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the increases which arise under the restructuring pay deals made under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>The position is that the final element of the restructuring pay deals, that concerning in-school management, has only recently been agreed. Arrangements are now being made to pay the arrears of pension and retirement gratuity to eligible pensioners.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed before September 1998.</P>
      <P>Many teachers have already received an increase in their pensions.  These are teachers who retired before the commencement date &mdash; 1 July 1994 &mdash; of the restructuring pay deals.  The Government has decided that such teachers should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis, subject to a minimum increase of 2 per cent in their pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this decision, an increase of 2 per cent in pension, together with arrears backdated to 1 May 1996, was issued at the end of January 1998 to retired teachers whose pensions are paid by my Department.  At the same time, vocational education committees were informed they should authorise the relevant local authority <Col N="687" /> to make similar payments in the case of former vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is a former vocational teacher who retired in 1990 and whose pension is paid by Wexford County Council. As it appears he has not received the 2 per cent increase in pension, I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, to communicate directly with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I will continue to support the retention and development of second level school facilities in inner city locations where such schools have a viable future.  In this context, a new second level school is being provided in the north inner city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is the case, however, that the bulk of new housing development is taking place in suburban areas.  This, in turn, has created new centres of demand for second level school accommodation. It is an objective of my Department to ensure that existing schools within a reasonable distance of these areas can make adequate provision for any emerging demand.  In keeping with the objective of rational and economic use of resources, new schools will only be provided where no such facility already exists or existing accommodation is deemed insufficient or inaccessible.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by Deputy Bruton must be considered within the wider context of urban planning and my Department will continue to monitor developments in that regard.  Initiatives such as the master plan produced by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority provide an invaluable focus for the future development, including educational provision, of inner city areas.  The level of school accommodation in such areas is likely to be sufficient for the foreseeable future and policy emphasis will continue to be on measures to combat disadvantage.  These measures include pre-school education, drugs awareness, literacy programmes and measures to maximise retention at second level.</P>

      <P>In general, under the terms of the higher education grants scheme and the free fees initiative a student will not receive grant aid or free fees for a second period of study at the same level, except in the case of second chance students returning after a break of at least five years or in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness.  They may, however, have grant aid or free fees continued once the equivalent period of time spent on their original course has elapsed.</P>
      <P>This position differs to that of students pursuing courses funded under the European Social Fund aided middle level technician and higher technical business skills programmes.  The ESF-aided middle level technician programme consists of one or two year courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical/business skills programme consists of three year national diploma and one year &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; diploma level courses.  The programmes apply to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects.  In general, free tuition and a means tested maintenance grant are provided for the approved duration of one ESF-aided course only.</P>
      <P>However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, where trainees have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, they are allowed to transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course.  Trainees who have completed not more than the first year of a degree level course are eligible to receive free tuition for a maximum of a further three years on an ESF-aided MLT and HTBS course.</P>
      <P>These regulations governing the payment of tuition fees for ESF-aided MLT and HTBS courses form part of the operational programme for human resources and are part of the community support framework 1994-9.</P>

      <P>In 1998, for the first time the Government has provided substantial dedicated funding for the funding of research and development through the Department of Education and Science.  The new allocation of £5 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science for recurrent funding of research and development projects.  It is envisaged that the funding will be available for research and development in the humanities, the social sciences and science and technology.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is being consulted about the administration of this funding.  It has been asked to develop proposals and mechanisms for expenditure of this research and development provision on the basis of making funding available to universities and institutes of technology through a competitive process.  The Higher Education Authority has consulted widely in its consideration of the issues and has, <i>inter alia</i>, considered the views of the Irish Research Scientists Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of the advice of the Higher Education Authority, Deputy Treacy, is to announce decisions this evening relating to mechanisms <Col N="693" /> for the expenditure of the additional £5 million allocation.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under the student support schemes enables students who have limited means and the academic potential to benefit from post-graduate research courses in third level institutions to be able to do so.  Over 3,200 students pursuing post graduate studies were in receipt of means tested support of over £9 million in the 1996-7 academic year.  It is not my intention to rearrange these student support mechanisms at this time.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's question refers to an application by Ferns national school, County Waterford, for grant assistance towards the costs of a range of improvement works.  An architect from my Department visited the school recently to carry out an initial examination of the proposed works and his report has been furnished to my Department's building unit.</P>
      <P>Also, following receipt of the school's application my department's planning section initiated an examination of the long-term school accommodation requirements in the Ferns area.  This examination is now completed and a report on this has also been referred to the building unit. The building unit is currently examining the grant application in the light of these reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-6 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-6 and 1996-7 academic years and set for review this academic year.  In the light <Col N="694" /> of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-8, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge from £150 to £250 for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
      <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams/registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the framework will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.  I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support where necessary of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in special schools, including schools dedicated to children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional and behaviourial disorders.</P>
      <P>Because of the range of individual needs which can present and the consequent variety of responses being availed of by children with autism in the Dublin area, I am not in a position to indicate to the Deputy the precise number of children being catered for in the area or the precise number awaiting particular placements. However, I am aware that a number of children with autism are currently seeking placement in special school facilities and my Department is actively engaged in seeking to accommodate these needs.</P>
      <P>In the 1995-96 school year, my Department commenced a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism.  Two special schools in the Dublin area are currently involved in this programme.  The schools in question are located at Beechpark, Stillorgan and currently cater for a total of 37 pupils with autism.</P>
      <P>The Department has commenced a review of this pilot programme.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides <Col N="697" /> a commitment to the introduction of an equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  I have already announced my intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates.</P>
      <P>The scheme will apply to all students registered with effect from the 1998-99 academic year, including year 2 and year 3 students, who satisfy the means test requirements.  The same means test and income limits as apply on the third level support schemes would be applied under the PLC scheme.</P>
      <P>Academic requirements for a grant will be satisfied by securing a place on a PLC course in the Republic of Ireland approved by the Department of Education and Science.  The Department of Education and Science produces a list annually of approved post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>Other requirements are that the student's parents, or the student in the case of mature students, must be resident in the Republic of Ireland since 1 October 1997 and must be an EU national or have official refugee status or humanitarian leave to remain in the State.</P>
      <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the development of significant new administrative arrangements.  I will announce further details on the administration of the scheme in the near future.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance scheme, operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, provides for the payment of a training allowance to unemployed people who attend approved second and third level courses.

    <P>A proposal has been submitted to my Department <Col N="704" /> by a local group, An Fochoiste Meánoideachais, and City of Dublin vocational education committee that a school should operate on a site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin in Artane.  The suitability of this site, even as a very temporary location for an educational facility, is in question because of its small size.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a significant amount of surplus accommodation in post primary schools in the north east of Dublin.  In the circumstances, it is essential that the possibility of using existing accommodation for an all-Irish post primary facility should be fully explored before any other option is considered.

The question of establishing such a class and the timing of any such development will be considered in the light of the inspectorate's report. <Col N="705" /></P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the delays which occur in certain areas before school children may be psychologically assessed.</P>
      <P>In view of the current urgent need in the primary sector, 15 psychologists who are also qualified primary teachers are being seconded to my Department's psychological service for a period of three years.  This initiative will greatly increase the number of primary schools having access to the help of an educational psychologist.</P>
      <P>After the deployment of these additional 15 psychologists, there will still, however, be a number of primary schools, including the school mentioned, where there will be no schools' psychological service in the short term.</P>
      <P>However, a planning group, which includes representatives of all the partners in education, has been established by me with the task of preparing detailed recommendations for the development of a national educational psychological service.  The work of the planning group is now well advanced and it is expected that it will report to me before the end of the current school year.  It is examining the current availability of psychological services to children and young people, and will be making recommendations as to the developments which will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all schools.</P>

      <P>There are 409 primary schools in the Dublin region of which 159 are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The current maximum class size for a primary school with disadvantaged status is 29 pupils.</P>
      <P>There are 187 second level schools in the Dublin region of which 59 are designated as disadvantaged. The teacher allocation to all second level schools is determined on the basis of a pupil teacher ratio of 19 : 1 in the case of ordinary enrolments and on a <i>de facto</i> ratio of 16 : 1 in the case of enrolments on certain programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme and PLC courses.</P>
      <P>There are 52 special schools in the Dublin region.  The pupil teacher ratios in these schools are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme, at primary level, was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 schools were included for capitation purposes only.  Three schools from the area in question were granted disadvantaged status at that time.  However, I understand that the school to which the Deputy refers did not apply for inclusion in the scheme on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Data regarding regional pupil teacher ratios and regional classroom sizes is not readily available.  The national pupil-teacher ratio in the current school year is 21.7 to 1.</P>
      <P>In 1996-7 the number of classrooms nationally with 35 or more pupils was 1,441 while the number of classrooms nationally with 40 or more pupils was 46.  The number of split classes, i.e. consecutive and multi-grade classes, nationally with 30 or more pupils in 1996-7 was 1,631. Classes in all schools which are designated as disadvantaged cannot exceed 29 pupils.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that, where maxmum class size guidelines are breached in a particular class or classes in a school, this usually results from a conscious decision taken by school management with a view to facilitating much smaller classes elsewhere in the school.  My decision to retain the demographic dividend arising in the current school year will ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio will decline to below 21.5 to 1 in the 1998-99 school year.</P>

      <P>Students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions in Northern Ireland are eligible for fee grants subject to meeting the terms of the student support schemes.  The approved courses and institutions are set out in the annual schemes.  Fee grants are not payable in respect of courses pursued in third level institutions in Britain.  I have no plans at present to introduce fee grants for this purpose due to overall resource constraints.</P>
      <P>Under the British Government proposal to introduce tuition fees, I understand that all EU students entering higher education courses in the 1998-99 academic year will be eligible for grant assistance towards this tuition fee from the UK authorities, subject to the same conditions as will be applied to UK students.  In this regard, it is likely that those students with reckonable incomes below £23,000 will be fully grant-aided by the appropriate local education authority and will not have to pay any contribution towards the fee.  Students with reckonable incomes of between £23,000 and £35,000 will be partially grant-aided and will accordingly, only be liable for a portion of the full fee.  Students whose reckonable income exceeds £35,000 are unlikely to be grant-aided and will be liable to pay the full £1,000 tuition fee.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that students who commenced higher education courses in the UK prior to the 1998-99 academic year will not be affected by the introduction of a tuition fee.  For those students the current support arrangements will continue for the normal duration of their current course.  Similarly, students who had their places confirmed before 1 August 1997 and subsequently deferred their place until the 1998-99 academic year will be treated as other students who commenced courses in the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full details of the arrangements, including the administrative arrangements, are available from the British Council, Newmount House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2.  Officials of my Department are engaged in ongoing discussions with their counterparts from the Department of Education, Northern Ireland in relation to the practicalities involved. <Col N="709" /></P>

      <P>Each post-primary school in the south east of Ireland is assigned to a named psychologist of the Department of Education and Science.  Students and parents may access this service through the school authorities.</P>
      <P>South Tipperary was one of the pilot areas used for the development of a psychological service to primary schools between 1990 and 1993.  After the completion of the pilot phase, the psychological service in the area was continued. One of the 15 psychologists currently being appointed on three year contract will be joining the South Tipperary psychological service in September 1998.</P>
      <P>At present, there are a number of counties, including counties Waterford and Wexford, where it has not yet been possible for my Department to provide a psychological service for primary schools.  Clinical psychological services are provided by the regional health board.</P>
      <P>A member of my Department's psychological service will liaise with the clinical services to establish the nature of the needs of the person mentioned and to make recommendations on educational provision.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 543 and 544 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools, including schools designated as disadvantaged, is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>The sixteenth teaching post at Sacred Heart Boys' national school will be lost at the end of the current school year because the enrolment at the school in September 1997 declined to 471 pupils, seven points below the figure set for the retention of this post.  Accordingly, the authorised staffing level for the school for the 1998-99 school year is a principal, 15 teachers and a further two remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Schools which are unable to organise their classes in compliance with maximum class size guidelines may apply to my Department for additional staffing.  If the managerial authorities of this school project feel the September 1998 enrolment at the school is likely to be such that it cannot be managed within recommended maximum class size guidelines, details of the projected enrolment should be forwarded to my Department immediately.</P>

      <P>The question of providing physical education facilities at this school can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when physical education facilities will be provided in this particular case.</P>
