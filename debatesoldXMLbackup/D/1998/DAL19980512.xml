    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Good progress continues to be made under the strategic management initiative, the programme of change in the public service.  As set out in Delivering Better Government, the key objective is the achievement of an excellent service for the Government and the public as customers and clients at all levels, building on the good service provided at present.</P>
      <P>The preparation of new strategy statements by Departments and offices was a key requirement of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 September last year.  As I announced on 1 May, the new statements of all Departments and of offices under their aegis have now been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are being published.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, came into effect on 21 April last.  A considerable effort has been put into preparing to meet the requirements of the Act which will result in major changes in the culture and practices of the Civil Service.  Taken with the publication of the strategy statements, a new climate of openness and transparency in the conduct of official business has been created which is unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> The pursuit of quality customer service is at the heart of the change programme.  The Quality Customer Action Plans of Departments and Offices, launched towards the end of 1997, are now in operation.  A system to monitor and benchmark progress across the Civil Service is currently being drawn up to ensure that the momentum is maintained in this important initiative.</P>
    <P>On 19 February last, following consultation with the Opposition parties, I announced the establishment of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Strategic Management Initiative and Deputy Quinn is a member of that committee.  I said then it was entirely appropriate that the Oireachtas, with whom the Civil Service at official level is so deeply engaged, should be more actively involved in the process, particularly now at the stage of implementation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the new legislation I mentioned, up until now most of the effort in the strategic management initiative has been devoted to developing the proposals in the key areas of Delivering Better Government.  This effort has been harnessed through the various working and other groups which were established.  Arising from their recommendations, the position is that the SMI Implementation Group, which is driving the change programme in the Civil Service, has prioritised four areas for action this year.  These are in human resource management, financial management, information technology and regulatory reform.  There is a very wide agenda for change in the management of human resources, with the emphasis on giving more authority and responsibility to line managers in managing and developing their staff.</P>
    <P>An effective performance management system is a vital part of modern human resource management and central to the improvement we seek in the delivery of quality services.  Consultants were engaged last year to advise and assist in designing an appropriate system for the Civil Service.  As part of their report, the consultants advised that successful implementation of the performance management system will require that issues such as organisation of work and reward-recognition be addressed.  The report is being considered by the SMI Implementation Group prior to submission to the co-ordinating group and the Government.  Arrangements for implementing the proposed performance management system will involve consultations with the Civil Service unions in accordance with the participative approach provided for in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>In relation to financial management, changes are necessary to support the SMI process, in particular, to underpin a results-driven approach to managing the public sector in a modern, competitive economy.  Earlier this year the Government took decisions on administrative budgets and multi-annual budgets.  Further proposals on the delegation of financial authority and on a new model of financial management will be submitted shortly to the implementation group.  As I mentioned, proposals on information technology and <Col N="1259" /> regulatory reform will also be considered later in line with the priorities set for 1998 by the implementation group.</P>
    <P>Chapter 10 of Partnership 2000 sets out the framework for implementing the change programme in the public service.  A key feature is the 2 per cent pay increase that is dependent on the achievement of verifiable results in each Department and office in implementing its action plan on a partnership basis between management, staff and unions in support of the changes.  A General Council Report, No. 1331, has now been agreed providing for the setting up of Partnership committees comprising management, unions and staff representatives.  Departments and offices will now establish Partnership committees in each organisation to develop the action plans for change.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership was established arising from the commitment in Chapter 9 of Partnership 2000.  The centre has consulted widely with management and unions in the public sector to identify the level of partnership existing in the workplace and to promote discussion of partnership at local level.</P>
    <P>The changes already effected are significant. The changes still to come will be equally challenging.  I am satisfied with progress to date and am determined that no momentum will be lost in progressing the change programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the significant changes to which he referred?  How does he perceive them as someone who has been in Government on numerous occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Delivering quality Government is the best change in the front line.  Much of the earlier work of Delivering Better Government was about preparation and involved various groups.  These groups were cumbersome in many ways.  The co-ordinating group of secretaries led from 2 May 1996 and the co-ordinating general group included the social partners and outside academics.  Since their work was completed, the specialist, general and implementation working groups have worked effectively.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the emphasis has been on making the system work.  The various commitments of Partnership 2000 which are now in place, together with the quality management initiative, are providing a better focus.  It is also more interesting for civil servants as they are directly involved in implementing something real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply which I will study in some detail. He referred to productivity agreements under Partnership 2000 and the 2 per cent to the public service.  Is there an agreed method of measurement of productivity for awarding this 2 per cent or will it be an automatic increase conceded by management without any tangible evidence of productivity?  If so, will the Government, when <Col N="1260" /> it settles the internal claims and demands in the various Departments, under the auspices of openness, transparency and freedom of information, inform the public of the terms of the productivity agreement, how its measurement was arrived at and how it will be policed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the increase will not be given across the board without any tangible measurement of productivity.  I have insisted that the opposite will be the case. Hay Consultants, who have carried out most of the surveys in State and semi-State bodies and the Civil Service, have brought forward a report which raises a number of issues, including productivity recognition and how rewards should operate.  The implementation group is considering these issues.  Before a productivity agreement is reached, trade unions must understand that real change and participation should arise from that mechanism.  Otherwise, it will be a hopeless exercise.  Whatever arises from the implementation of an agreement, which will shortly be brought to Government, must reward people for change and involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the public be told?  How will it measure this change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hay consultants have put forward a number of recommendations which have not been brought to Government, although I am aware of what is in the report.  It is difficult to find a mechanism.  However, it is possible, as can be seen from the experience in other countries. However, too often, our productivity agreements applied to everybody, regardless of whether there was any productivity.  This was discredited in the 1970s and became known as bogus productivity. We must design a system of meaningful productivity and those who are genuinely involved should be given some reward &mdash; otherwise an agreement will never be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, while the recent improvements in the telecommunications systems in the House are welcome, in order to improve the performance of Parliament there is need to consider library and research facilities available to Members since improvements in that area would result in the more smooth and efficient running of the Houses of the Oireachtas and committees of the Houses?  Is that matter under examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not included in this question, but if the Deputy wishes I will raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will disagree with the objectives of improving the quality of service for Government.  Is the Taoiseach aware that with the extra demands caused by, among other things, the Freedom of Information Act, according to a number of sectors in the public service a 25 per <Col N="1261" /> cent increase in staffing is needed if they are to maintain even their current productivity level?  In the context of the strategic management initiative, is there a plan to take into account that extra pressure by way of extra resources or staffing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got that statistic.  He seemed to imply it came from some committee.  I assure the House and secretary generals that an increase of 25 per cent in staffing is not envisaged in the short, medium or long-term.  Additional pressures arise in implementing the strategic management initiative, the Freedom of Information Act and some of the initiatives in Partnership 2000, but they will be met by present staff resources.  Priorities must be followed and old procedures may need to be changed, but we cannot afford huge staff increases.</P>

      <P>The fifth plenary review meeting on Partnership 2000 took place on 27 April. It was chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and focused on the following two themes: enterprise, jobs and small business, and rural exclusion and action to develop agriculture, food and forestry.  A comprehensive exchange of views took place on each of these themes from both short-term and long-term perspectives.  It was agreed at the meeting that the next plenary review will take place towards the end of July and will focus on the themes of social inclusion and modernising the public service.</P>
      <P>On the implementation of Partnership 2000 generally, impressive progress has been made so far, as is clear from the latest progress report which has been laid before the House.  Partnership 2000, like its predecessors, has produced very significant benefits in both economic and social terms.  These benefits certainly can be sustained, provided there continues to be a disciplined adherence to the agreed terms.  For our part, the Government will remain firmly focused on implementing fully all commitments, thereby paving the way towards a successor partnership agreement early in the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government considered broadening participation in the debate on plenary reports and meetings?  Bearing in mind the apparently increasing opposition in some quarters to Partnership 2000, will the Taoiseach agree it is necessary to deepen consensus and that that will be done only by widening participation?  Does he consider it is useful that reports of quarterly reviews are debated in the House or alternatively by the NESF?  Will he agree publication of reports should be more widespread because of <Col N="1262" /> the distance between ordinary rank and file members, particularly among trade unions who have displayed a hesitancy about their future commitment to Partnership 2000, so that they would be involved in the process in a way that previously has not been the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>About a month ago I agreed that these reports would be published and laid before the House.  I am not against debate of the matter in the House.  There would be greater focus on the matter if the debate took place here and it would be better in terms of access to it by the public and the media.  In regard to achievements, I take Deputy Quinn's point.  Many people consider the bottom line all the time.  A huge amount has been achieved each year for the past ten years under the four programmes, much more so than other countries that have not followed such programmes.  Some of the countries who moved away from such programmes are returning to them.</P>
      <P>I hope to attend the full plenary session next month or the month after and to address some of these issues directly with the social partners.  I have met them individually and in groups during the last nine or ten months but I hope to talk to all the partners to see what progress can be made to assist the programme as it reaches its halfway stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a delegation representing the south Armagh Farmers and Residents Committee on 29 April last.  The delegation was led by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  They conveyed to me at first hand their experiences of the intense security presence in <Col N="1263" /> south Armagh and the disruption and loss it causes.  I raised the matter with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at our meeting in the margins of the European Council in Brussels on 1 May.  I conveyed the serious concerns as expressed to me and I emphasised the need for de-escalation in line with the greatly improved security situation. The Prime Minister noted these concerns and undertook to examine the situation.</P>
    <P>I reported last week on my recent meetings with Sinn Féin.  No further meetings are scheduled.  The question of a meeting with President Clinton is being kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 5 is the Taoiseach aware of the sensitivities and concerns felt by relatives of the victims of paramilitary violence about the scenes at the Sinn Féin ard fheis last week involving people who had been convicted of serious offences?  Does the Taoiseach feel he was reported in context on television yesterday when he was quoted as saying that those who criticised what happened at the weekend have been criticising everything for all of his life and that he believed that people concerned at the impact of such scenes seemed to have nothing to say other than &ldquo;no&ldquo;?  Does the Taoiseach accept that there are many people who are concerned about this matter and its impact on the pro-agreement campaign in Northern Ireland who are not negative and who seek a resounding endorsement of the Agreement in both jurisdictions?  Will the Taoiseach reflect further on the matter in this light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said in numerous interviews yesterday.  As I said in my statement on Sunday night, I hold no brief for triumphalism and my political career proves that. Amid the recriminations that have emerged in the North we should not forget that republican and loyalist prisoners have been a significant force for peace and agreement.  The Government is and will be prepared to deal with dissidents in the strongest possible way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point I made about people saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; I was responding to a question raised about what Mr. Bob McCartney said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday morning.  I made the point that on a daily basis he continues to attack the UUP and others who are in favour of the Agreement but he never puts forward an alternative.  In the civilised campaigns for the referenda there is an obligation on such people to put forward their alternative.  In the absence of doing so they are being negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Bruton's point about the relatives of victims of violence, I am sensitive to those who have been the victims of paramilitary violence.  I have met many of their representative groups.  At the weekend I met some of the families of those who are missing, whose plight Deputy Currie raises frequently in the House.  I continue to raise the issue of missing <Col N="1264" /> people with republican sources and of punishment beatings and other unacceptable behaviour in Nationalist and loyalist areas, although more recently in Nationalist areas.  These issues must be considered together and argued against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree on reflection that the comments of Mr. David Ervine of the PUP, for example, that those who are concerned about the scenes which occurred at the weekend are not confined to those who have said &ldquo;no&rdquo; all their lives and that people who have said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and who have worked hard for an agreement are also concerned about the triumphalist scenes?  Does he agree that his remarks should be exclusively interpreted as referring to one politician and not to others who are also concerned that sensitivity should be shown in the way each side comports itself between now and polling day?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that I advised him and others to ensure that in this campaign everything which is said, even in response to questions, should be addressed to both communities in Northern Ireland and that one cannot address one community in isolation from the other?  There is a heavy responsibility on the Taoiseach to ensure that everything he says is conducive to getting a large &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in Unionist and Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland and not only in one community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All my remarks are well considered.  When asked a question about prisoners, I answered it in the way I just said and without triumphalism.  I first raised the question of triumphalism on Sunday night in an interview. While that is neither here nor there, I am glad others have used the same word.  It is wrong to engage in triumphalism.</P>
      <P>As regards Mr. McCartney, I have an obligation to sell the Agreement, North and South, and to defend it.  I also have an obligation to respond to a person who misinterprets the Agreement and to clarify matters.  It is a fair, balanced and comprehensive Agreement but obviously Mr. McCartney does not agree.  I will not remain silent for ten days and watch him misinterpret and mislead decent Unionists with whom I have been glad to engage in recent years.  Yesterday morning in an interview, he misinterpreted all three strands of the Agreement and cleverly crossed the strands at various points.  There seems to be a difficulty in Northern Ireland about somebody raising a voice against him.  I have an obligation &mdash; which I hope will be helpful &mdash; to the Unionist parties not to give a free run to a person who totally misinterprets what was agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with what the Taoiseach said about Mr. Bob McCartney's negative approach.  Does he agree there are many supporters of the Agreement in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1265" /> Unionist and Nationalist, who are in favour of prisoners being released and recognise that they have played a useful role in both communities by supporting the peace process, but who are anxious to ensure the handling of prisoner releases is not of a nature as to cause needless further hurt to victims and their relatives?  Does he agree it should be handled by the Government in a way which is not capable of being stage managed by people who do not come under its control and which is not, as in the case of this weekend's Sinn Féin ard-fheis, counterproductive and antipathetic to the interests of all in this House who seek a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in both referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  It could have been handled in a calmer way and it was my understanding that it would have been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, whatever his intention &mdash; and I have no doubt his intention was entirely honourable and correct in terms of criticising Bob McCartney &mdash; the perception in Northern Ireland was that he was criticising all Unionist spokespersons and he should take the opportunity today to correct that impression?</P>
      <P>Does he agree it should not be underestimated that it is extremely difficult for the Unionist community in Northern Ireland to accept the bona fides of Sinn Féin and the IRA?  Everybody in the House welcomes the decisions of Sinn Féin and the IRA over recent weeks on the Agreement.  However, does he agree it is extremely important that we do everything we can on this side of the Border, particularly on Thursday when all party leaders in the House will present a case for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on the Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty?  Does he also agree we should reassure the Unionist community that this State, similar to the British State, has no strategic or selfish interest with regard to Northern Ireland, that we are amending our Constitution in a way which incorporates the principle of consent for the people of Northern Ireland, that they have nothing to fear from this State, but on the contrary they have everything to gain by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that, with much of the media following this matter, every day I do several interviews, particularly as all parties are now trying to hold meetings, question and answer sessions and public events to sell the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Anybody who listened to the full four and a half minute interview yesterday would realise it was entirely obvious whom I was talking about.  Unfortunately, I did not edit it.</P>

      <P>No, but at Sunday's meeting very useful comments were made in terms of the Unionist community about the years of violence and the horrible acts that were carried out.  I understand how people who fought against this feel, having met hundreds of them, but we continually take up just one or two points to form the next headline.  Then somebody is rung up to have a go, etc.  That would be normal if it was a general election but this is a referendum.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet four non-domestic channels, but they were only concerned with what mischief and argument they could introduce into this campaign.</P>
      <P>I spent the day explaining the sensitivities to people as I have done on several occasions.  I welcome media interest in the campaign, but do not want to see what ball can be hopped between any two politicians, North and South. This is more important than that.  I have taken a number of examples of clips from the weekend which I intend bringing to the attention of the people involved because we have been dealing with this issue of life and death for too long.  I am not talking about issues involving me &mdash; I will handle myself &mdash; but those involving what happened at some conferences.  If people are going to give a view, they should give a balanced one.  I raise this point because I am aware that, following the G8 meeting at the weekend, approximately 25 channels will beam into the country to follow the events of the remaining days of the campaign.  Therefore, we must be sensitive in the way the campaign is handled.</P>

I took it from the Taoiseach's reply to a supplementary question that their behaviour was contrary to his understanding of what would happen.  Did he believe they would behave differently?

Does he believe the adage that when one is explaining, one is losing and that, therefore, he should be careful to modulate every answer he gives?

I am not prepared to allow people interpret things outside the Agreement. I will not allow people to exaggerate and imagine things are in the Agreement that are not in it.  I will not sit around like a dummy listening to people misinterpreting the Agreement.  I will correct them when necessary.  Having said that, I will make sure the necessary balance is maintained.  I will be as helpful as I can to the UUP, the Alliance Party and others in the North who are correctly interpreting the Agreement as negotiated.</P>

      <P>I do not believe anyone is asking the Taoiseach to be silent on issues that are being misrepresented.  Does he agree, <Col N="1268" /> however, that when he is responding to misrepresentation or criticising a particular individual or party he should indicate the criticism is specific to that person or party rather than general?  That should be the case regardless of whether he is referring to the republican side, loyalists, Unionists or others.  In Northern Ireland the decommissioning issue is one of the greatest problems for the Ulster Unionist Party in urging a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote because Unionists bore the brunt of the death and destruction carried out by republican paramilitaries and are therefore suspicious.  Given that, could he indicate to Sinn Féin through whatever public or private channels are open to him that it should show it is prepared seriously to address this issue within the context of the Agreement, and that it is not enough for it to say it is not a matter for that party?  He should also remind Sinn Féin that in 1995 both Mr. Martin McGuinness and the party's submission to the Mitchell body on decommissioning indicated that the party could speak authoritatively on the issue.  It is necessary to reassure the Unionist community in voting for the Agreement that everyone who supports it is committed to its full implementation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be far too much focus on it from our point of view. However, there was only one bomb in Dublin in the early 1970s whereas half a dozen towns in Northern Ireland have been repeatedly destroyed, thousands of people there were murdered and tens of thousands were maimed, largely from the Unionist community.  We on this side cannot say there is too much emphasis on the issue because for them this is literally a matter of life and death.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to consider all aspects of the Agreement but it is an important issue.  My remarks last Friday week and over that weekend were widely welcomed by the Unionists, the British Government and other parties in Northern Ireland.  I stated that the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons is an essential part of the settlement; if the Agreement is to work and all parties are to participate, weapons must be put out of commission for good.  How the weapons are put out of use is a matter for discussion under the Agreement but it cannot be avoided &mdash; that is clear from the document.  Anyone taking part in the executive must pledge commitment to non-violence and to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, and this obviously would not be compatible with groups remaining active and armed.  Sinn Féin and the loyalists have signed up to a commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations and have <Col N="1269" /> promised to use any influence they have &mdash; which is considerable &mdash; to remove these arms within the two year period, and that must be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the revulsion in the North, not only among Unionists but among Nationalists, at the scenes of triumphalism at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis?  These scenes were shown in greater detail on Ulster Television than on RTE and they are having a profound negative effect.  The people concerned should be warned that there should be no repetition of that.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Taoiseach's reported remarks, as someone who was in the North over the weekend I can tell him it was not understood that he was referring to Mr. Bob McCartney when he talked about people who have said negative things for all of the Taoiseach's political life, because Mr. McCartney has not been in politics all that long.  There may be some truth in the old Northern adage: &ldquo;Whatever you say, say nothing&rdquo;.  That advice is applicable on many occasions and while it may be difficult to follow when one is being door-stepped, perhaps the Taoiseach should remember it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what remark Deputy Currie heard over the weekend because I did not make it until yesterday afternoon.  The only remark I made at the weekend was to quote comments made by Dr. Paisley in 1968, 1978, 1988 and 1998, in each of which he said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I quoted directly from him and also quoted Mr. Trimble's positive remarks.  It is useful for us to remember that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to have that clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty doing that.  I disagree with people who say we should be silent during the campaign &mdash; I think we must be more vocal.  The polls from the North show there is still a high percentage of people in the &ldquo;doubtful&rdquo; category, for one reason or another.  The opinion poll does not give any information to indicate they are moving one way or the other.  I saw the result of the poll so that I do not know from where that spin comes.  That people are doubtful means there is a requirement to explain matters.</P>
      <P>On the question of prisoners I recall, after Christmas when Dr. Mo Mowlam visited the prison, the reaction of people, the graffiti, the signs on the walls and the reaction of loyalist prisoners. I know how that was interpreted in many parts of the community and how things were interpreted last Sunday as well.  I am very conscious of that. That is why, as I said to Deputy Quinn earlier, the triumphalism inherent in these things is not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are endeavouring to do, as a result of this Agreement, is to ensure that all prisoners renounce violence for good so that the communities <Col N="1270" /> and the villages which have been bombed and attacked can have a different future.  We need to convince people North and South, during the next ten days, of the importance of voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and supporting a comprehensive, fair and balanced agreement in a substantial way rather than getting hung up on words here or there because that is not what this Agreement is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the Unionist community, notwithstanding the requirement in the Agreement that the participants to the Assembly and to the Executive would have to give an undertaking to renounce violence, there is already a requirement for such a commitment by those who take their seats on local assemblies and local councils throughout the North and that, on occasion, violence has occurred when Sinn Féin representatives had signed those undertakings?  Just as the release of the prisoners was a necessary confidence-building measure to assuage some of the fears of the Sinn Féin delegates and members of that political grouping, does he recognise that between now and 22 May &mdash; and perhaps even more importantly between now and 25 June &mdash; there is a serious need for substantial confidence-building measures from the Republic to address the real concerns of the Unionist community?  Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking as to the measures he envisages in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Confidence-building measures are necessary for all communities.  It is important that we display to the Unionist and loyalist communities our commitment to negotiating and implementing the Agreement as laid down. Within that Agreement there are legislative, structural and constitutional matters to which we are committed and which we have to implement.</P>
      <P>We have to show clearly to those communities that we will implement them.  There are several issues within Departments which are important to people in Border regions.  Departments are co-operating on numerous important European matters, which have been highlighted by Unionist politicians, every one of which, while small individually, is important.  The only time I receive correspondence from all MEPs in the North, including Dr. Paisley, is on European matters. Like previous Governments we always give serious attention to attempts to give satisfaction on these issues.  They are the kind of confidence building measures we should always implement, especially between now and 25 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I must have regard to the constitutional rights of parents as the primary educators and carers of their children.  It is a matter for the parents of each child to decide whether they wish to avail of the formal education service offered by my Department.  In some instances, particularly where serious disabilities are concerned, parents may choose for clinical or other reasons not to avail of a formal education service.  However, I assure the Deputy that my Department is prepared to respond positively to any request for the provision of an education service for any child, including children with serious disabilities.</P>
      <P>There are currently 78 special classes for children with severe or profound mental disability. These classes provide a specially tailored education service to approximately 460 pupils.  A number of applications for the establishment of further special classes are currently being considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997 as published contains statutory safeguards for the rights of children with disabilities.  In particular, on the enactment of the Bill, boards of management will have a statutory duty to ensure that the educational needs of children with special needs are provided for.  Following publication of the Bill, my officials and I have had consultations with a wide range of interests in education, including parents of children with severe disabilities.  I am considering proposals for amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to clarify areas of concern to such parents, to address, as far as practicable, their concerns and to further strengthen the rights of their children.</P>

      <P>Why, in the Bill to which he refers, is continual reference made to &ldquo;within resources&rdquo; when these rights are stated?  Is he not seeking to circumscribe with qualifications what are constitutional rights?  Will he refer to the comment made in the High Court judgment on the Paul O'Donoghue case that Ireland has lagged behind in this area and that we should not, to paraphrase his reply, wait to respond to a request for provision, but should rather provide early intervention and assessment and the provision <Col N="1272" /> of information to parents to enable them make proper choices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Committee Stage of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, will be taken next week.  The Bill does not undermine the constitutional imperative of providing an elementary education to all children within the compulsory age.  No legislation could be passed by the parliamentary draftsman or be presented to the House if it was predicated on the principle of somehow qualifying a constitutional right.  I will elaborate further on that on Committee Stage and, as I suggested in my reply, we will introduce amendments to clarify the position.  In no circumstances does the Bill qualify the rights to an education of a child with severe or profound disability.</P>
      <P>We will respond proactively in terms of making services available to any request we receive regarding the provision of special classes or from parents regarding children with special need.  We are catching up with an historic deficit.  It was three years before the Supreme Court passed judgment in the Paul O'Donoghue case while the deliberations which led to the special education review committee report commenced in 1990.</P>
      <P>We are working with other Departments on this.  For example, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently undertaking the implementation of a recommendation that emanated from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  This called for an integrated approach and a disability support service to ensure an integrated response in terms of advice, counselling and guidance and in terms of making parents aware of available facilities to meet the needs of all children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the past, the Department and the State were too dependent on the service providers for information on the needs in the community.  I have experienced that this year.  Often, the needs of parents were not brought to the attention of my Department as readily as they should have been. In those instances we took immediate action in terms of providing additional classes and, in some instances, additional schools, which will be ready for next September.</P>

Are the number of court cases pending &mdash; another is reported in the newspapers today &mdash; not a symptom of serious problems within his Department?  Is it not most unsatisfactory that so many parents feel the need to contest their rights in court and is it still the case that as many as 4,000 children with disabilities in mainstream schools have no support services?</P>

      <P>On the question of court cases, I have identified a number of the issues involved.  I do not want to say much about cases before the courts, but I have made proposals to the parties concerned in terms of the provision of services to the children involved.  However, certain elements of many court cases involve other key issues pertaining to the lack of provision in previous years on which the parents seek adjudication.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any parent should have to go to court to secure an education for his or her child and I will do everything I can to prevent such an occurrence.  That is why I am taking a number of steps with regard to schools for autism and other measures to improve the services and resources available to children with special needs.  On taking office I discovered that we expected the parents of children with special needs to raise 15 per cent of the capital costs of providing a special school or of providing extensions to their schools.  I immediately stopped that and brought provision up to 95 per cent.  I want to do more than that in the current year in terms of special schools.  I also want to provide additional resources to special classes attached to mainstream schools.  In this regard, I refer the Deputy to the announcement last week on the IT 2000 package, which contained clear discrimination in favour of children with special needs, be they in special schools or special classes in mainstream schools, in terms of the provision of information technology, computers and so on.  We will be very generous, as we should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The current arrangements for assessing reckonable income under the higher education grants scheme were revised in 1992. When the new arrangements were introduced the reckonable income limits were increased by 40 per cent.  Entitlement to a grant operates on a graduated basis.  To qualify for a grant a candidate's reckonable income must be below the income limit which varies for the level of grant and in relation to the number of dependent children in the family.  Where there are two or more children attending full-time third level education the relevant income limits are increased by £2,000 where there are two such children, £4,000 for three children and so on by increments of £2,000. The income limits vary with the number of dependants.  Different limits apply where there are fewer than four dependent children, between four and seven, and eight or more.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the new arrangements in 1992 the income limits were set by the actual number of dependent children in excess of two and up to ten.  The income limits varied depending on whether a maintenance grant was payable and, if so, whether it was payable at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate and depending on the rate of lecture fee grant payable.  These arrangements were cumbersome and difficult for the local authorities to administer while being extremely difficult for an individual candidate to understand.  The new arrangements simplified the income limits, easing the administrative burden on the local authorities and making the system more comprehensible for candidates generally.</P>
      <P>Further refinement of the present graduated system to provide tapering relief for candidates whose income exceeds the relevant limits would have implications for the administration of the scheme and also involve the commitment of substantial additional resources.  In light of overall resource constraints I am obliged to have regard to the relative priority of all proposals for improvements and the many competing demands across the education system.  I will, however, keep this question under review in the context of my Department's ongoing review of student support provisions and in light of the available resources.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the changes were made to make the system, which is graduated, more comprehensible.  There are two rates &mdash; the full rate and 50 per cent.  Where the parents' gross income exceeds £17,740 a child will qualify for the 50 per cent rate.  A 25 per cent and 75 per cent rate should be introduced.  An arbitrary cut off point is not the way to handle <Col N="1275" /> the problem.  Those who qualify for the 50 per cent rate are liable for the £250 registration fee which the Minister was kind enough to raise by £100 this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's view about the arbitrary cut off point.  I have made the same point on a number of occasions.  We are looking at ways to ameliorate the position in the context of the forthcoming Estimates.  Some significant changes have been made in the past ten months. I identified the creation of additional places as my priority at third level.  All the data illustrate that, as things stand in the economy, most people at third level will secure lucrative employment. Many still cannot make it to college because insufficient places are available.  In the autumn we increased the number of places available by 8,000.</P>
      <P>The previous Government ignored post-leaving certificate students and would not give them a grant for over four years.  The previous Minister did not consider this a priority.  This was inequitable.  I believed the matter had to be dealt with immediately.  In the 1998 Estimates we have provided for the payment of grants to these students. The number of places available on PLC courses was increased by 3,000 in the autumn.  That was not a bad day's work.  Priority has to be given to the creation of additional places and the improvement of infrastructure within the colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the fact that priority is being given to the creation of additional places, it is more important to ensure access.  As the Minister is aware, many students cannot avail of the opportunity to take up third level places because they do not qualify for a maintenance grant.  Those living in the university cities have a distinct advantage.  The Minister's response is disappointing.  It appears he has no intention of doing anything significant in this area this year.  The system was improved by his predecessor who abolished third level fees.</P>
      <P>Parents will continue to be assessed on gross rather than net income.  A grave injustice is being done to many children.  The Minister has an obligation to build on the good work done by his predecessor.  It should not be forgotten that the cost of accommodation has increased dramatically and that students living away from home have the added expense of bus fares home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy who referred to my predecessor and his party's policy in Government.  He identified the students whom he considers to be in difficulty because of their inability to survive on the maintenance grant.  The Deputy's party provided for the introduction of free fees benefiting those in the middle and high income brackets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the allocation of resources a decision was taken to increase the Education Estimate by between £40 million and £50 million to provide for the introduction of free fees, not the implementation of the de Buitléir report which recommended the elimination of covenants and the utilisation of the money saved in refining and reforming the grants system to make it more equitable for the less well off.  I acknowledge the introduction of free fees proved beneficial for the PAYE sector but it did not lead to the creation of one additional place for a student on low income or from a disadvantaged background.  We should stop pretending that it did.</P>
      <P>Having discussed the matter with a number of organisations involved in this area there are a number of steps we could take to increase access and participation.  For instance, the hardship funds available to the colleges could be increased. The support schemes, including scholarships, operated by a number of universities and institutes of technology produce far better results in terms of giving young people at second level in certain communities the wherewithal to participate at third level.  Familiarisation trips are also organised.  Much more work could be done with greater results in terms of access and participation than grand gestures.</P>

      <P>With respect, I have not treated the Deputy to rhetoric.  The creation of an additional 8,000 places at third level and 3,000 additional places at PLC level will make a significant difference in terms of access and participation.  The scheme will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates.  Decisions have not been made yet in terms of the allocation of resources but I will take on board the Deputy's suggestions.  I also have concerns about mature students and helping students in college who may be in financial difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill will set out a statutory framework for the administration of the education system at first and second level. The general aim of the Bill is to ensure that the education system is as responsive, effective, efficient and accountable as possible in meeting and responding to the rapidly changing demands for high quality education in the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important objectives of the Bill is to enhance the transparency of the education <Col N="1277" /> system and its accountability to the various interests, including students and parents.  Another important objective is to set out the rights of all of the partners in education &mdash; parents, patrons, students, teachers and the State.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Bill makes specific provision in section 9 for schools, as far as resources permit, to ensure that parents of a student have access in the prescribed manner to records kept by the school relating to the progress of the student in his or her education.  The details of the process by which parents will have access to their children's records will be set out in regulations which, in accordance with section 33, will be made by the Minister following consultation with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.</P>
    <P>Providing for access to students' school records is only one of the provisions designed to enhance accountability and transparency in the system. Other important measures include the provision that boards of management must keep accounts and records of all income and expenditure, that boards of management must establish procedures for informing the parents of children in the school of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school and that school plans must be circulated to parents, patrons, teachers and other staff of the school.  As far as students are concerned, the Bill provides that boards must establish and maintain procedures for the purposes of informing students of the activities of the school.</P>
    <P>I am confident that increased openness and sharing of information in the education system and in regard to the progress of individual students in schools can only enhance the ability of the system to respond increasingly to the needs of individual children and to provide an enhanced quality of education to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To what records does the Minister consider parents will have access?  Will parents have access to assessments on their children?  Will they have access to all tests and reports relating to the performance of their children?  Will parents have access to discipline and attendance records?  What are the Minister's ideas in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that parents will have access to all tests and end of terms results particularly at second level.  It is already the case at second level that the results of end of term examinations are posted to parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of psychological assessments and reports are dependent on the agreement of parents in the first instance.  There is then general engagement between the psychologist, the school and the parents regarding the progress of the child.  Regarding access to standard tests and results, parents should have full access to information on how their child is progressing.  The behaviour of the child is another feature in that <Col N="1278" /> regard.  The Bill will statutorily underpin this area.</P>
    <P>In line with the spirit of partnership which has been part of the education process and which I am anxious to continue, the regulations must be worked out with the partners after the Bill is passed.  I do not foresee many difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My impression of the school system, which may be misplaced, is that schools are not keeping systematic records at present. Will the Minister put in place an administrative resource to allow schools maintain detailed records of a child's entire school history?  Will he provide resources so that schools can give this type of detailed information to parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a comprehensive information technology resource at second level with regard to school administration and the compilation of data.  The intention is to make this available at primary level also.  However, I do not accept the position is as bad as the Deputy suggests.  I left second level school in 1978 and when I returned to the school recently in my capacity as Minister for Education and Science, it gave me copies of my school reports over five years.  The school compiled all my reports from first year which made for interesting reading.</P>
      <P>Schools produce reports.  I recall butterflies in my stomach almost 20 years ago as I waited for the postman to deliver the dreaded school report at the end of the year.  I presume the system has improved since that time in terms of the level of reporting.  However, the legislation must deal with school authorities which are deliberately obstructive in some areas and deny parents access to records.  It is most important that full access to information is statutorily underpinned but it will not demand the huge level of administrative resources suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport review committee was set up by my predecessor in January 1996.  The committee undertook a comprehensive study of the school transport scheme and the recommendations in its report deal with a broad range of transport issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> The committee publicly invited submissions from interested parties as part of its work and 324 submissions were received.  These submissions, which reflected the views of a wide range of interested parties, were taken into account in so far as possible when the report was being drawn up.  I received the report in September 1997 and it is currently being evaluated in the Department. The report was published on 21 January 1998 and has been circulated to various interests.</P>
    <P>The contents of the report have given rise to extensive debate.  A number of responses have been received by my Department which are currently under examination.  Prior to and subsequent to the publication of the report I have had extensive discussions with a number of individuals who are members of the relevant organisations.</P>
    <P>I am finalising my submission to Government on this matter.  I have asked that invitations be extended to Pambo, Bus Éireann and the National Parents Council, primary and post-primary, to meet me before I send my final submission to Government.  In the meantime I have directed that the recommendations in the report which have negligible or no cost implications should be accepted and implemented.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report, including those concerning the introduction of new fees and increasing current transport charges, do not necessarily reflect Government policy.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State will meet the National Parents Council because it is an integral part of the system.  Is the Minister of State aware of the safety review undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government?  Is he aware that one of the recommendations of the report, which was recently completed, is that the current ratio of three pupils to two seats should be maintained for people up to the age of 19 years?</P>
      <P>What is the Minister of State's opinion of the ratio in view of the severe overcrowding on many school buses?  Students who are 17 or 18 years of age are the same size as adults and three of them must squeeze into two seats.  A large number of school bags and sports gear must also be piled onto the buses and they are left lying in the aisles. A large number of students must either sit on the floor or stand.  What is the Minister of State's opinion of the ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the study and its conclusion regarding the ratio.  The Deputy is aware that the Bristow school transport review committee also considered this area and declined to make any recommendations.  It stated specifically that it was a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government which at the time was conducting or was about to conduct the study to which he refers or had flagged that it was about to announce it.  I have received a number of representations from various people <Col N="1280" /> in my constituency and throughout the country concerning the 3:2 ratio.  The view has been frequently expressed that it should be changed, given that people of a certain age tend to be physically larger now than they were when the ratio was first introduced.</P>
      <P>The Bristow committee concluded that we should generate more income exclusively from charges to improve the school bus transport service.  I am adopting a wider remit in my submissions to Government.  I will point to the option of increasing charges, thereby generating extra revenue along the lines suggested by Bristow, but with one exception &mdash; we have decided medical card holders will not be charged. Another way to generate more revenue is to obtain more Exchequer funding.  This means there are three options: to increase charges, obtain more Exchequer funding or a combination of both.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the outcome of the Government's deliberations will be on what I send them, but if sufficient revenue is generated to sufficiently improve the service, I would be prepared to examine the ratio.  To change it along the lines the Deputy suggests would require additional expenditure on the school transport system.  If I obtain or generate more funding or get agreement on how more can be raised to run the system, I have various improvements in mind. The ratio is not top of my list; special needs pupils are.  If sufficient revenue is generated, I am prepared to examine it sympathetically given the representations I have received.</P>

I will obtain the information and communicate with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It requires additional funding to improve the school bus service and there are three options for raising that revenue.  At present the special needs budget is taking up an increasing proportion of the school transport budget and I predict that will continue.  A recent report by the Ombudsman stated that cases concerning <Col N="1281" /> pupils with special needs had to be decided on merit, not by arbitrary restriction.  I am sure the courts would take the same view and rightly so. If the money allocated to the school transport budget remains static or increases by the rate of inflation each year, it will create a situation whereby the special needs pupils will take priority and the service to other pupils will be gradually run down.  If the existing level of service is to be maintained, a level with which many people are unhappy, and the necessary improvements for special needs pupils introduced, which I am sure the courts will compel us to introduce anyway, additional funding must be found.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer contributes some £40.5 million annually to school transport.  Some £5 million is contributed by parents by way of charges.  If additional funding is to be obtained, it does not take a mathematical genius to work out that there are only three options available: to increase charges to parents, to seek additional Exchequer funding or to adopt a combination of both.  I believe we are morally obliged to maintain the existing level of service and I am committed to improving it.  That will cost more money and it is correct to say that may involve an increase in charges.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have referred to a report we received from the Ombudsman concerning his decision in a recent case.  The reasoning in the O'Donoghue judgment is along the same lines.  I am sure the courts will take the view that pupils with special needs have a priority and that, if they seek a reasonable level of transport and bring the State to court to obtain it, they will be successful. That means we will have to spend more money. Bristow identified £3 million as the figure for minimal improvements.  We will have to spend more money from the budget on special needs cases and that will mean that, unless the overall budget is increased either by Exchequer funding or increased charges, the service for others will be run down.  Whether the money should come from the Exchequer or by way of increased charges will be a matter for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Maximum class size guidelines have been a feature of primary schools for many years.  The existing maximum class size guidelines are: 35 in the case of a single grade structure; 34 in the case of two consecutive grades structure; 31 in the case of a multi-grade structure; and 29 in the case of schools which are designated as disadvantaged.  Although the overall enrolment within a school may be organised within the recommended guidelines, some schools choose to organise their classes in such a way that some classes exceed the guidelines while others are well within the guidelines.  While the allocation of teachers to classes is the responsibility of the school principal and board of management, maximum class size guidelines are designed to ensure schools do not have excessively large classes.</P>
      <P>Statistical information submitted to my Department by primary schools suggests there are classes in breach of maximum class size guidelines.  It is important to emphasise that, where maximum class size guidelines are breached in a particular class or classes in a school, this usually results from a conscious decision taken by school management with a view to facilitating much smaller classes elsewhere in the school.  Many schools have classes which are much smaller than the maxima.</P>
      <P>Where enrolment figures are such that the school is unable to organise its classes within the recommended maxima, application should be made to my Department for the appointment of an additional teacher.  In the current school year, a total of 44 schools received additional staffing for this purpose.  The allocation of posts arising from the demographic dividend will have the effect of improving pupil teacher ratios and of reducing average class sizes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there are over 54,000 children in classes of over 35 pupils, which is the highest level he has indicated?  Effectively, 12 per cent of children are in classes of 35 or over, some being in classes with over 40 pupils.  Does the Minister agree that he needs to take a more proactive approach in ensuring that class sizes are within the guidelines he has set?  Does he accept that having 54,000 students in classes that are in excess of the guidelines is not commensurate with his allocation of 44 teacher places to deal with the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this problem has existed for a long time.  In 1988 the maximum class guideline was 39 for a single grade, 38 for two consecutive grades and 35 for multi-grade.  We have come some distance since then.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,395 classes with over the 35 pupils.  In many of those instances the principal and board of management take decisions on the organisation of the school regarding class size, which means one can have very large and very small classes in a school.  For example, the principal may decide that the infants and higher infants' classes need to be particularly small, and therefore the fifth and sixth classes may be bigger. That is why one tends to get more than 35 pupils in a class.</P>
      <P>In addition, there may be high class sizes in rapidly developing schools, particularly in urban areas undergoing population increase.  This can be ameliorated in the following school year.  If, because of its numbers or circumstances, a school is genuinely unable to reorganise its classes to accommodate the maximum class size guidelines, it can apply to the Department for additional teaching posts.  An inspector will visit the school and make an assessment to satisfy himself or herself that the school can organise itself within the guidelines.  The inspector can then recommend the allocation of extra posts.  That is the procedure.</P>

The Minister must accept that if a maximum is to mean anything, it must mean the norm, and this is not the norm.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a guideline.  The Minister could become overly prescriptive and dictate to schools how they should organise, but then there would be no flexibility.  Targeting is important in the allocation of teaching posts under the dividend.  There are other questions tabled about the need for more remedial, home-school liaison, special needs and resource posts.  We must make <Col N="1284" /> decisions on the allocation of the resources available to us.</P>
      <P>We could become more prescriptive and tell principals that they cannot organise their infants, higher infants and first class pupils in a certain way.  We could tell them to have higher numbers at that age and to lower the class sizes at a higher age group, but that would be overly prescriptive. We must allow for local judgment.  However, since we began retaining posts within the system under the demographic dividend with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987-88 there has been considerable reduction in pupil-teacher ratios generally.  The situation has improved, though we have some distance to go.  I acknowledge that a class size of over 35 pupils is too high in any school and I would like to reduce it, but we must work within available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a knock on effect of large class sizes is that a teacher cannot give individual attention to students?  Large amounts of homework are given to pupils as a result, with senior infants receiving over an hour's homework.  I do not think there are any guidelines in this matter and I know that the Minister does not want to be prescriptive, but he should give a commitment to look at this area with a view to issuing guidelines on the recommended homework levels for primary students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very popular if I became prescriptive in reducing homework.  I do not think senior infants should receive any significant amount of homework.  One hopes that the teaching of infants and senior infants would not be based on the homework approach.  I do not want to be overly prescriptive, but more could be done in supporting schools with homework clubs, particularly for children from disadvantaged areas.  I have had considerable representations and suggestions on this issue and am seeking to improve the situation.  We occasionally get isolated complaints about excessive homework.  We ask our inspectors to investigate those complaints and to make recommendations to the principals concerned.  There should not be excessive homework for young children.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is unacceptable that 2,000 children are in classes of 40 pupils and over?  He should be intervening in that area without being excessively directive. Our class sizes are among the highest in the OECD.  Does the Minister accept that excessive class size contributes to the fact that 8 to 10 per cent of children leaving primary school fail to achieve an acceptable standard of literacy and numeracy?  There must be some intervention in this area.  Perhaps the Minister should begin non-directive consultations to tackle this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point.  There are 43 classes with over 40 pupils, and there were similar numbers last year and the previous year. <Col N="1285" /> I am concerned that we could not improve those figures.  I visited my old primary school yesterday and there were 55 pupils in the infants class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>He would say his is the best led and most effective trade union.  I take the Deputy's point.  However, there is general educational debate on the pupil-teacher ratio and its impact on literacy and numeracy standards.  Some of the countries with the best results in standardised international tests in those areas have the highest pupil-teacher ratios, such as the Far Eastern countries.  The debate should focus on what targeted resources we can make available to children who need additional help to improve their literacy and numeracy standards.  This returns to the issue of providing more remedial teachers and a better psychological service.  I accept the Deputy's point that we must acknowledge, in the context of the OECD's analysis of reports, Ireland's pupil-teacher ratio is still the highest in Europe.  Within OECD countries Greece and Turkey have a higher pupil-teacher ratio than us and that position is not satisfactory.  We need a broader public debate on the pupil-teacher ratio in primary education.  Over the past number of years there has been complacent acceptance that because our population has been in decline all is well at primary level; because the number of pupils has been falling there should be more teachers available and people were satisfied with the retention of the demographic dividend.  There is no mention in Partnership 2000, to which all the partners signed up, of the PTR at primary level and no specific target was included in it, unlike PESP and previous social partnership agreements which had specific targets for improvements in resources for primary education.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the 1998 Estimates provide for the retention within the primary system of posts which would otherwise be lost.  The effect of this will be to reduce the PTR from 21.7 to less than 21.5 in the coming school year.  I expect to be in a position to <Col N="1286" /> announce my intentions in regard to the allocation of the demographic dividend very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate his priorities in respect of the various commitments he made in this area?  He indicated the 117 one teacher schools, with the exception of the 16 which have ten or more pupils, will get an additional teacher.  Can we expect the 117 one teacher schools or, at a minimum, 101 of them, will receive an allocation from the 190 posts?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate his approach to remedial teaching?  He gave a commitment that pupils in the 741 schools who do not have access to a remedial teacher will be accommodated. Where stands his commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that he will keep in those schools the teachers who will be freed up as a result of falling pupil numbers?  I can quote chapter and verse from where that is stated in the manifesto.  Where stands his commitment in respect of Breaking the Cycle, early start and the many specialised programmes against disadvantage?  There are 190 posts involved, but the Minister has ambitions for the provision of almost 900 additional teachers. Will he seek a Supplementary Estimate to provide that additional teaching resource or will his various promises be shelved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have four years to achieve those objectives under the programme for Government and the manifesto.  I have stated publicly we will not achieve the objective in respect of all the one teacher schools in the first year, but we will go a significant way towards achieving it.  We will make additional resources available in respect of remedial teaching, but it does not involve 741 posts.  The Deputy's interpretation of what I said is very simplified.  He is aware a remedial post is appointed to a cluster of schools, particularly in rural areas.  I have further details on that which apply to a later question.  There are other issues pertaining to home-school liaison and resource teachers and I am currently in negotiation and discussions with the INTO on that.  We expect they will be concluded shortly in relation to the priorities for this year and we will notify the schools shortly after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has literally interpreted the commitment given in the manifesto.  We gave a commitment we would retain teachers in the system. The Taoiseach and I met Senator Joe O'Toole prior to the general election and the INTO requested the retention of the demographic dividend.  It was specific about that request because last year the previous Government refused until very late in the day to sanction the entire demographic dividend to the then Minister.  It was only on Good Friday of that year, before the teacher <Col N="1287" /> conferences, that a compromise was arrived at whereby the dividend was conceded within Government to the Department of Education. The INTO was concerned that each party going into the election should give a commitment to retain the dividend and we gave such a commitment.  Last year there were more than 400 posts available for distribution.  I am unlucky because there are only 190 net posts available this year, but we can still make significant progress on the commitments I gave in respect of one teacher schools, remedial teachers and home-school liaison and resource teachers.  We are currently negotiating with the INTO which has a number of issues it wishes to discuss with us.</P>

He should re-examine some of his priorities, particularly in relation to the disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resume where I finished last Thursday when the time available to me was unfortunately limited.  I did, however, manage to give the House a full account of the Government's funding proposals for local Government.  I am sure these will be discussed in greater detail later.  There are some other aspects to the Bill not related to funding which I will now discuss.</P>
      <P>The first aspect provides for the postponement of local elections from June of this year to June 1999.  I take this opportunity to explain to Deputies that the Government has decided to hold the local elections on 11 June 1999.  This was decided after the Bill was published.  The decision to postpone was not lightly taken.  Local elections are the principal means by which the political will of the local community is expressed.  It is now almost four years since the people spoke at town elections and almost seven in the case of city and county authorities.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily, therefore, the case for local elections in June of this year would be strong. However, these are not ordinary times for local government.  There are substantial and unique arguments why the elections should be postponed for 12 months.  A short breathing space is necessary because a major programme of local Government renewal spanning a number of years is now under way.  It is important, therefore, that the general outline of the new local government system should be known before the electorate decides who is best suited to represent them.  Few would deny that local government needs to be made more attractive to a wider range of people, particularly women and the young.  The prospect of a vibrant and reinvigorated local government system should help provide broader participation. A review of the electoral areas, taking account of the 1996 census results, is needed due to population changes since the last review in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey has established committees to review local electoral areas and to report by 1 July next.  The establishment of the strategic policy committees system which will strengthen and widen local democracy is now well under way, representing the most radical development in local government for decades.  It is important the system is given the chance to operate and become embedded at local level <Col N="1293" /> before elections are held.  The reasons for this short postponement are, therefore, unique.  It will allow the building blocks of the local government renewal programme to be put in place or at least known before the electorate decides who should represent them at this crucial time of change.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill which is unrelated to funding relates to local authority recruitment procedures.  There is currently a statutory requirement that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the local appointments commissioners.  The inflexible nature of this requirement has prevented a solution being found to the plight of professionals in general, and engineers in particular, who are being retained in temporary employment on a long-term basis by local authorities.  Such is the length of service of many of these people at this stage that they should in equity be made permanent. This has not been possible up to now but this amendment will remove the statutory barrier and provide the flexibility to allow the position of these people to be regularised.</P>
    <P>No decisions have yet been made on precisely which posts will in future be designated for filling through the LAC.  The intention is, however, that the resources of the LAC will in future be devoted more to the selection and recruitment of the senior tiers of local authority posts.  The more junior professional posts will be filled by way of local competition as is the case with the clerical and administrative grades.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in more detail with the main provisions of the Bill.  The most important provision is the establishment of the local government fund &mdash; this is included in section 3.  The fund is the central cog around which the new financing system will revolve.  The accounts of the fund will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General each year.  Payments into the fund are dealt with in sections 4 and 5.  The Minister will be required to pay £270 million into the fund in 1999 from the Department's Vote towards the general purposes expenditure of local authorities.  I have already explained some of the uses to which this money will be put and the in-built mechanism to protect its value for future years and to alter it if circumstances change. Section 5 provides for the payment into the fund of the proceeds of motor tax.  This will also include driver licence duties and other miscellaneous fees and duties collected by the licensing authorities.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which moneys may be paid out of the local government fund are set out in section 6.  These will include contributions towards the expenditure of local authorities on non-national roads and general purposes expenditure.  It may also include payments to local authorities in respect of expenses incurred in promoting the delivery of quality and efficient local authority services and in respect of expenses incurred by the Minister in collecting motor tax.  This section also provides <Col N="1294" /> for the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on payments to local authorities from the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 7 allows local authorities to deduct the expenses incurred by them in collecting motor tax before they pay the balance remaining into the local government fund.  A similar provision was contained in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The adjustments to the motor tax rates are provided for in section 8.  The increases will be 3 per cent from a date to be appointed by order following the enactment of this legislation, and a further 3 per cent from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide for the postponement of local elections until 1999.  As stated earlier, this is being done to facilitate a review of electoral area boundaries and any structural changes to local government arising out of commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium in regard to local government renewal. The local elections will, therefore, coincide with the European elections in 1999 and will be held every fifth year thereafter.</P>
    <P>Section 11 removes the statutory requirement in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The vast bulk of recruitment to local authorities is already carried out locally in any event.</P>
    <P>Section 12 repeals various sections of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, which are necessary to enable the new funding system to be introduced.  A number of provisions of this Act, however, remain in place, including those abolishing domestic water and sewerage charges and establishing on a legal basis the local government &mdash; value for money &mdash; unit and value for money auditing.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that we refocus on local government in this its centenary year.  It is time we provide it with adequate resources.  The funding system this Bill provides for will be buoyant and satisfy the funding needs of local government as we approach the millennium.  It is also more broadly based and fairer than that proposed by the previous Government.  Without adequate funding we cannot have a meaningful proactive local government system.  The House can be assured that all efforts will be made to ensure the funding made available to local government will be used wisely and that the public will be able to recognise this clearly in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to move this important legislation on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  It will provide the resources necessary to support a local government system of which we can be proud and which will meet the needs of a modern democracy.  This Bill is worthy of the support of every Member of the House and I look forward to a constructive debate on it.  I confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to chill the atmosphere of goodwill engendered by the Minister of State, but we will vote against this Bill on Second Stage because it is not the major local government reform and restructuring claimed by the Minister.  It is a much more limited Bill and at the end of the day local government will be largely unreformed.  Some useful initiatives have been taken, but I wish people would stop coming out with nonsense about all the great things we are going to do as we stand on the threshold of the new millennium.  That is a most irrelevant comment and, on a Bill such as this, is a currency that has been debased beyond all measure.</P>
      <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is to hand over the proceeds of motor taxation to local authorities and provide for an increase in the level of motor taxation.  The Bill is necessary because the Government decided to do this a little differently from the previous Government.  The system being provided for in the Bill is more onerous than that put forward by the rainbow coalition Government in December 1996.  That decision provided for an optional maximum increase of 6 per cent over a three year period in motor taxation, with a maximum of 3 per cent in any one year.  The Bill provides for a mandatory increase of 6 per cent over a period of less than eight months, with the first increase on the enactment of the Bill and the second in January next year.  Instead of the option to increase motor tax by up to 6 per cent over a period of three years, the Government will require local authorities to increase motor tax by 6 per cent in a period of less than eight months.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State made the usual points.  He pointed out that the rates of motor tax have not been increased since 1992, that we should be happy about that and that the total increase of 6 per cent over this year and next year compares with inflation of almost 15 per cent since the last increase.  Ministers should avoid such balderdash.  This matter has nothing to do with the general rate of inflation.  The Minister could argue that if motor tax had been increased at any time since 1992 the general rate of inflation since then would have been more than 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is not a virtue to claim that one is doing something which increases a price by less than the general rate of inflation.  That is equivalent to saying that if one had the chance one would have increased the general rate of inflation by more than it had actually increased.  There is no virtue in increasing a price by less than the rate of inflation and there is no virtue in saying that this increase in motor tax is less than inflation since the last increase because no credit is due to any Minister for that.  It is an unrelated matter and is not something for which I will give credit to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we will have is an increase of 6 per cent in the rate of motor tax in a period of eight months or less.  That will put an unfair burden on motorists, particularly in rural areas.  They have no alternative but to use their cars because there <Col N="1296" /> is no access to public transport.  In urban areas people could make up their minds to do without cars but in rural areas that is not possible.  People in rural areas will be obliged to pay the extra 6 per cent in a period of less than eight months.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the local authorities to make that increase irrespective of funding available to them from other sources.  This is even more constraining when we recall that shortly after his appointment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spoke about his intention to cap the rating ability of local authorities.  He intends to limit the local authorities' ability to increase their funding by putting a cap on the extent to which they can increase rates on commercial and other rateable premises.  On that score alone the reform element of the Bill is much less than that for which the Minister is seeking credit.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State try to give the impression that they are giving some autonomy to local authorities.  However, they are taking back a big proportion of that autonomy straight away.  This is not surprising because the Government has a disorganised and ambivalent approach to the reorganisation of local government.</P>
    <P>As a justification for the increase the Minister of State said, &ldquo;. external expenditure associated with motoring such as air pollution and traffic management cost more each year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister of State included that in his speech because he goes on to say that the revenue which local authorities will get from motor tax and this mandatory increase of 6 per cent in less than eight months will go into non-national roads.  It has nothing to do with air pollution and traffic management and it is utterly gratuitous for the Minister of State to state it as a relevant consideration in justification for the Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be that we need to take other measures to deal with air pollution and traffic management, although the Government is hell bent on making air pollution and traffic management problems even more intractable in Dublin having adopted the most ill-advised approach to the Luas project. I bet that the overground parts of the Luas will be built but the underground element will not. The Minister and his colleague in the Department of Public Enterprise are doing nothing to deal with the problems of air pollution and traffic management in Dublin.  I still await the information I requested from the Minister of State last week on the levels of air pollution in Dublin.  I hope he has not forgotten my desire for that information.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government dealt with this issue it decided that 85 per cent of the motor tax fund was to be retained by the local authorities which raised it and 15 per cent was to go into an equalisation fund.  Detailed discussions had been held with the local authorities on this fund and a broad measure of agreement had been arrived at. However, the Minister will not indicate what equalisation provisions he has in mind.  He and the Minister of State have had many opportunities <Col N="1297" /> to do so since the Bill was published but they have been silent on the matter.  Even during questioning in the House they have been unwilling to commit themselves to a description of how they intend to proceed, the criteria they will use or the mechanism that will be put in place.  Once again we see the hand of Government coming into an area in which the Minister claims to be giving a greater degree of autonomy to local authorities.  He is not doing anything of the sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech contained a large section on equalisation.  He referred to a pilot study being carried out in Galway County Council, which was discussed in the House some time ago.  It appears the Minister of State has decided to ignore the discussions that have taken place, has picked one local authority area for the pilot study and hopes it will produce results capable of being used in the equalisation provisions. He hopes it will clarify the performance of various local authorities and how that might be measured.  I submit that is likely to be a snare and a delusion.  If the Minister thinks that out of a pilot study of one local authority he will get a detailed prescription for making a workable equalisation fund he will be disappointed.  There is nothing in what the Minister of State has said that provides an answer to the concerns discussed with local authorities and which they felt had been largely resolved.  He is throwing the lot back into the melting pot and carrying out a pilot study in Galway.  There is no justification for hanging the equalisation provision as a whole on that study.</P>
    <P>When I reflect on another fact, I do not think the enterprise is worth a candle.  Beginning next year, this much vaunted system of reform will mean local authorities will get somewhere in the region of £20 million more than they would have got otherwise.  If we divide £20 million between all the local authorities and assume it will be spent on non-national roads, I am sure even the Minister and any of our colleagues in the House could spend the portion got by our respective local authorities before we have breakfast in the morning and would have plenty more work to do.  I could spend the portion Kildare County Council will get in the constituency of South Kildare and would not even have to go half way to where Deputy Wall lives before I would have spent all the money on filling in a few potholes. To go to all that trouble for an equalisation fund to try to tell us how we should slice approximately £20 million between all the local authorities which will be clambering for it, is a ludicrous enterprise.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not a large reform and is much ado about nothing.  When we see this famous local government fund coming into operation, we will see how little all this ado is about.  The Minister is hell-bent on doing this fancy pilot study which is supposed to tell him how to scientifically slice £21 million into small amounts for individual road authorities.  He does not even believe it will happen soon because after his description of this <Col N="1298" /> intellectually elegant looking system with performance indicators, accounting codes of practice, existing forms of accounts and so on, he came to the conclusion that these issues are at an early stage and it will be some time before the extensive changes which will result will be brought about.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say the end result will be a buoyant funding system for local authorities. That will not deal with the types of problems staring us in the face each time we turn a corner on the road.  All that, for this ringfenced inflation proof system which will mean approximately £20 million more for local authorities in 1999 than in 1998 and a 6 per cent increase in motor taxation thrown in for good measure.  That is not an enterprise which is worth all the trouble the Minister is taking and does not justify the type of description he has given it.</P>
    <P>I welcome one provision &mdash; that local authority elections will be held in 1999 and in every fifth year thereafter.  It will mean that every five years local authority and European Parliament elections will be held on the same day.  The Minister dithered over this issue for a long time saying behind his hand to members of his party in local authorities that he really wanted to do this but was afraid the Opposition, I in particular, would disagree with him.  It was necessary for me to say in the House that I thought it was a good idea before the Minister could screw up his courage to the sticking point and make the one sensible proposal in the Bill.  It is a perfectly sensible proposal which will be welcomed by voters, local authority members and potential candidates.  I hope this means that in the future Governments will not invent spurious reasons to defer local government elections.  In particular, I hope we will witness no more occasions when local government elections are deferred because the Government of the day claims to be planning a major reform of local government.  We have heard that before and local government remains largely unreformed.</P>
    <P>Imagine my disappointment when I found that, in spite of my hopes, my worst fears were realised.  The paragraph in the Minister's speech on the postponement of elections contained four bullet points telling us why a short breathing space between June 1998 and June 1999 was necessary before we hold local elections.  The reasons the Minister gave included the major programme of local government renewal and the fact that we wanted a vibrant and reinvigorated local government system and a review of the electoral areas which will be finished in July, although there was no reason it could not have started sooner.  The <i>pie ce de résistance</i> of them all was that the strategic policy committee system would be put in place.  The Minister solemnly said it is important the system is given the chance to operate and become embedded at local level before elections are held.  Those are the reasons for this short breathing space.  They have nothing to do with it, as the Minister knows perfectly well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> By the time we hold the local elections, the strategic policy committee system, which I welcome, will not be embedded at local level as it will take a while to get that system fully functioning.  Some strange things are going on.  In recent days, I learned that Galway County Council, for example, in setting up its strategic policy committee system, is also in the process of disbanding a committee it has had for some years on national monuments and heritage sites.  I do not understand why it is obliged to disband this committee simply because it has strategic policy committees coming into place.  It is nonsense for the Minister to pretend this system will be up and running and embedded at local level before we hold the local elections.</P>
    <P>It makes perfect sense to get to a point where we decide &mdash; and make a firm purpose to stick to the decision &mdash; to hold local and European Parliament elections in a five year cycle and always in the same year.  We do not need any more fancy reasons than that for taking this perfectly sensible measure.  The Minister could have saved himself the trouble of going to the lengths of delivering this spurious rubbish in the House as a justification for doing something which is plainly sensible.  It was entertaining that the Minister was afraid to say in the House that he wanted to hold the local elections in 1999 because I might disagree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to find ways of indirectly conveying to the Minister that if he made such a proposal, he would be pleasantly surprised by the response.</P>
      <P>Another point to which the Minister of State referred was the provision in section 11 to remove some permanent local authority staff appointments from the ambit of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  That proposal will have to be carefully examined.  The Minister set out some of the reason for doing this and referred to one problem particularly in relation to professionals, specifically engineers, who are being retained in temporary employment on a long-term basis by local authorities.  Undoubtedly, some action needs to be taken in justice to resolve the situation of people who find themselves in that position.  However, there is nothing in the Bill or in anything the Minister said which indicates that this measure is ringfenced, to use the Minister's phrase about the system, to deal with that problem.  I do not know if it is in that there are other problems where people in professional grades, engineers in particular, find it difficult to gain access to promotion posts in the local authority in which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of discontinuity in the engineering staff of local authorities which, in some cases, can reduce the effectiveness of the way they work.  That is not a criticism of the individuals <Col N="1300" /> involved, far from it.  However, if we keep moving people from one local authority to another, the benefits of continuity will not be available.  Will the Minister tell us more about this measure as the Bill is not forthcoming on it?  It provides that a section of a previous Act will be deleted.  The explanatory memorandum states the effect of this change will be to enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with the concurrence of the commissioners, to determine which professional offices are to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission. The Minister of State said the intention is that in future the resources of the Local Appointments Commission would be devoted more to the selection and recruitment of the senior tiers of local authority posts.  More than what?  Will they have other functions to perform?  Will they continue what they already do on a smaller scale so that they can spend more time looking at the selection and recruitment of the senior tiers of local authority posts?</P>
    <P>I refer to the expectation that the effect of the change will enable the Minister, with the concurrence of the commissioners, to determine which professional offices are to be filled by them.  What does &ldquo;concurrence of the commissioners&rdquo; mean?  For example, if the Minister decides certain local authority appointments are to be made by local appointments commissioners only and they disagree, will the Minister not go ahead with the appointments or will the commissioners have no option but to concur with the Minister's decision?  If they say &ldquo;no&rdquo; will the Minister not proceed with the appointments?  If they say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; will he or she say the matter should be discussed?  If the Minister says he or she will make the appointment anyway does it matter what the commissioners say?  It would be useful to know what this means because all we have to go on is the statement in the explanatory memorandum of what the effect will be.</P>
    <P>In practice, a provision is being deleted from existing legislation that gives the local appointments commissioners specific powers in regard to specific posts.  Will it be the case that the Minister can decide according to his or her mood or disposition that posts are to be filled in a different way?  If that is the case, with what powers will the local appointments commissioners be left?  A number of problems have arisen in the way some appointments were made but the Minister would have to agree the local appointments commissioners system has served us well in general.  I hesitate to change it without a more explicit and better motivated explanation than the Minister has chosen to provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be a little more forthcoming on what he intends to do.  I will not start imagining scenarios for which there might be no foundation.  However, if there is to be a system where posts can be filled in a different way, has the Minister considered what influences might be brought to bear in making decisions on filling <Col N="1301" /> them?  If he has not, he should.  The reason local appointments commissioners were given that job was to remove certain posts in local authorities from the political arena.  The Minister now says he will put certain posts back into what might be termed a political arena.  Will he consider putting in safeguards?</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to ring-fences for money.  Are there any ring-fences for the unspecified appointments procedures which the Minister seems to have in mind?  If not, the Minister should consider including some.  The Minister probably knows better than I, because I have never been a member of a local authority, just what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the general pretence that this is a major reform of local government.  The Minster tries to pretend that is the case and for 1999 he defined a quantum of funding that will be made available to local authorities and stated that because it will be index linked and ring fenced there will be a major change in the operation of local government.  That will not be so because the fact that a quantum of money will be expedited in that way will remove two elements in the argument that goes on every year between local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  It does not take a label off any expenditure decided on in the Custom House or put a new label on any expenditure that local authorities decide on, limited though it is.</P>
    <P>It does not bring any substantial area of local authority operation, other than the provision for county roads, into an area that might be called &ldquo;freedom of decision.&rdquo; It does not enable local authorities to take on any functions other than those which they administer currently nor does it reform, or in any way affect, the political, financial or operational balance between local authorities and the Department.  This is not a reform of local government; it is simply a different way of putting the same money to broadly the same purposes to which it has been put until now.</P>
    <P>After the Bill is passed, no member of a local authority will become a more powerful person politically than he or she is and no group of members will gain a new influence on what happens in their area.  No local authority can decide it knows better than the Custom House what the people in its area need in terms of investment programmes or development of community resources.  This is not a Bill to reform local government.  It brings the entire process of reform even further into disrepute to claim that such a limited Bill, which imposes a 6 per cent increase in motor tax over a period of less than eight months, is anything more than that.  This is not reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Bill, 1998.  It is an inadequate and backward measure in response to the needs of local government.  It removes from local authorities the autonomy granted to them under <Col N="1302" /> the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.  The Labour Party regards this as conservative and retrograde legislation that does not serve the interests of local democracy.  It is necessary to put the issue of local government funding in context to fully explain our objections to the Bill and the system of funding it seeks to impose on local authorities.</P>
      <P>Local government and local democracy have been the poor relations of our political and administrative system for too long.  Local democracy has not worked in Ireland and has never been given the opportunity to do so.  Failing to institute an independent and accountable system of local government funding has been the cornerstone of the problem.  Successive Governments failed to tackle this problem in a meaningful way until my colleague, Deputy Howlin, carried out a radical review of the issue when he became Minister for the Environment in l994.  By that time our system of local government funding was fractured, unwieldy and in many cases divisive.  The roots of the problem date back to l977 when, in one of the most short-sighted and populist moves in recent political history, Fianna Fáil abolished domestic rates and replaced them with the rate support grant.  This action plunged local government into 20 years of crisis in terms of funding. It not only undermined the range and quality of services local authorities could provide, it also removed power and accountability from elected local authority members.  Meetings in council chambers became increasingly irrelevant to the lives of ordinary people and communities became frustrated at the lack of response, mainly for budgetary reasons, they received from their local politicians and looked to national politicians and budgets to provide an adequate response to the demands of their communities.  Apart from commercial rates, local authorities did not have any independent funding after l977.  The abolition of domestic rates robbed them of their ability to raise finance and, equally important, removed the onus on them to be accountable to the electorate for the disbursal of that locally raised finance.</P>
      <P>Local government depended on central Government for funding.  Each year local authorities were obliged to go cap in hand to the incumbent Minister for Finance and eke out a budget.  However, as the economy contracted, inflation rose, the state of the nation's finances became a source of major political concern and budgets for local authorities failed to keep pace with inflation.  At a time when the demands and local authorities were increasing, the funding available to them decreased each year.</P>
      <P>From l985 onwards many councils were obliged to impose service charges on households in an attempt to stave off financial disaster.  Those charges were imposed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner across the country, which led to disparities from council to council and, in many cases, the wrath of the local population since they were viewed as a form of double taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> This position pertained in l994 when my colleague, Deputy Howlin, set about the most fundamental review of local democracy and published Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.  That crucial document identified a number of weaknesses in local government.  It stated that the range of functions carried out by local authorities was narrow and that in many cases local authorities were unable to respond to the needs of local communities which looked to central Government for an adequate response.  This state of affairs undermined the public image and effectiveness of local democracy.  The document also stated that local finance was characterised by a shortage of resources and an over-dependence on central Government funding through the rate support grant and that pressure to maintain services at their current levels had diverted councillors and staff from developing strategic and long-term goals for their local authority areas, which further undermined their public relevance.</P>
    <P>Measures were put in place by the previous Government to address these failings in our system of local government.  It was a comprehensive package of reforms designed to reinvigorate local democracy and to devolve power from Government departments and return it to those elected by the people at local level.  Local authority financing formed an integral part of the reform package introduced by Deputy Howlin.  For the first time in two decades, local authorities would have a dedicated revenue base.</P>
    <P>The funding reforms and the subsequent Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act enabled local authorities to shake off the yoke of central Government.  Local government was granted control over one of the most buoyant and important sources of finance, motor taxation.  Local authorities were empowered to retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor taxation raised in their areas, with the remainder being invested in an equalisation fund to ensure equitable disbursement of motor tax revenue across the country.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this system was that local authorities had their own legally constituted tax base, which was buoyant and already collected locally.  It returned to local authorities control over a substantial part of their budgets. This was also important for the vibrancy of local democracy because not only would councils have the power to make their financial decisions, they would also have to be accountable to the electorate for the manner in which this finance was invested in the community.  Councillors would also have to make an argument for any increase in motor taxation and outline to their electorate the projects and services which would come on stream as a result of such an increase.</P>
    <P>This system of financing sought to reinvigorate local government.  Its cornerstone was a dedicated, untouchable tax base, controlled by the local authority.  It is this system that the current Bill seeks to remove and that is a retrograde step by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  In Opposition, <Col N="1304" /> he was quick to criticise Deputy Howlin's proposals, in words that I am sure many Members will remind him of during this debate.  He was adamant that &ldquo;the system of local government should not be towed behind the family car&rdquo;. Those words ring hollow now as we debate the Bill.  The Minister has proposed a system whereby motor taxation will fund local government.  The changes introduced by him will serve only to halt the process of devolution initiated by his predecessor.  It is a conservative Bill that lacks imagination or vision.  It will ensure local government finance is firmly under central control.  It will retard the development of local democracy and fail to bring local government closer to the electorate.</P>
    <P>One has only to examine section 3 to see the degree of centralised control the Minister is foisting on local government.  That section states that the Minister shall manage and control the fund, which shall consist of such accounts as the Minister may determine and the said accounts shall be in such form and be prepared in such manner as the Minister may determine.  Section 4 goes on to concentrate control of the fund within the Minister's office.  Subsection (3) relates to future investment in the fund by the Oireachtas.  There is no forward thinking or effort to move control from the political machinations of the day.  There is only a minimal clause that holds the figure at the initial sum of £270 million and protects it from being outstripped by inflation.  Apart from that, public investment in the fund is at the arbitrary decision of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Subsection (3) requires the Minister only to have regard to the matters specified in subsection 4.  There is no obligation on him to increase the funding to enable local authorities to expand or enhance their services. The purse strings of local government remain firmly in the Minister's control.</P>
    <P>One of the most debilitating aspects of this stranglehold is that local authorities must go cap in hand each year to the Department before they are sure of their budgets.  They cannot plan, with any degree of certainty, the delivery of services over a three year period.  The enhanced policy and strategic structures established for councillors under Deputy Howlin's original proposals will be fundamentally undermined by this ministerial stranglehold.  The Minister has chosen to abolish an independent funding system for local government and replace it with a stifling centralised regime.  Local authorities must now join the queue with every other Department and organisation that relies on central funding.  Funding for local authorities will depend on the budgetary whim of the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Goverment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister is capping commercial rates in his new package for local government. This is an extremely condescending attitude for him to take.  On 3 February last he stated in the House that no local authority had allowed rampant increases in commercial rates in the past <Col N="1305" /> number of years.  Despite this record of prudent fiscal management, the Minister is now set to abolish the last vestige of local control over financial matters and cap the commercial rate levied by local authorities.  With the Minister's local government fund proposals, the Bill gives him a veto over the development of local democracy.</P>
    <P>We must question if this is the best way to finance local government.  At the outset I detailed the weaknesses of our local government system identified in Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.  Centralised funding procedures were the source of many of these failings. A new and progressive solution to this ongoing problem was devised, extensively debated and passed by the Oireachtas.  The system had just begun to operate, but the Minister's first action was to abolish it in its infancy.  This was a vindictive and short-sighted action by the Minister.  He is now trying to replace that system with a retrograde and conservative measure that will fail local government and local democracy.  The Labour Party rejects the fundamental thrust of this Bill and disagrees with its ideology and intention, because it will reverse the changes introduced to local government over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>However, beyond the main body of the Bill, I welcome the moves to bring an environmentally friendly analysis to our system of motor taxation. This will benefit not only public transport vehicles but many voluntary and community groups which use coaches and minibuses to cater for their members.  The Minister sees this as an initial &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of motor taxation rates which will be assessed in the future.  The EU is also examining policy in this area and may soon produce proposals which will reward energy efficient commercial vehicles.  I hope the Minister will prove amenable to these initiatives.</P>
    <P>I also welcome his proposal to provide for five-yearly elections to local authorities after the 1999 elections.  This reform is long overdue and I regret that it has been appended to a Bill which in every other respect will undermine rather than enhance local government.  The five-year term will allow local authority members to approach business in a strategic manner and will do away with the Minister's ability to postpone local authority elections.</P>
    <P>In responding to this debate, perhaps the Minister could indicate whether, in devising this section, he considered reform of the system of replacement councillors being drafted on to local authorities.  Did he, for instance, consider drafting regulations to introduce a degree of transparency?  The current <i>ad hoc</i> system is neither transparent nor accountable and detracts from the public image of local authorities.  I ask the Minister to give his views on the matter and to say whether he considered a substitute list system similar to the one operating in European Parliament elections.</P>
    <P>On section 11, the Minister said no decisions had been made on which posts would be designated to be filled through the Local Appointments <Col N="1306" /> Commission but it was intended that in future the LAC's resources would be devoted towards the selection and recruitment of the senior tiers of local authority posts.  The unions and professional representative bodies have major concerns about this section and in his Second Stage reply the Minister should be far more specific about the positions to be filled by the LAC.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which moneys would be paid out under the local government fund are set out in section 6.  These include contributions towards the expenditure of local authorities on non-national roads and general purpose expenditure; they may also include payments to local authorities in respect of expenses incurred in promoting the delivery of quality, efficient local authority services.  In south Kildare we have had problems with water and sewerage schemes in Castledermot, Prosperous, Brownstown, Ticknevin, Osberstown and Kilcullen.  Can we presume all these schemes will receive funding on this section or will the Minister still control the purse strings?  Those schemes are essential for the development of south Kildare.  I compliment the Minister for his prompt action to rectify the major water problems in Castledermot, which was greatly appreciated in that town.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party rejects the core proposals of the Bill.  It undermines the progress made in local government in recent years and will keep local authorities under the thumb of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Finance.  It dismantles a more open and democratic system of funding which was never given an opportunity to thrive at local level.  While some minor aspects of the Bill are to be welcomed, these are of little consolation given its essential import.  This destructive legislation will not serve local government, local democracy or our citizens.</P>

      <P>One hundred years on from the establishment under British legislation of our system of county councils, local government is in a sorry state.  A combination of the systematic financial starvation of local authorities and the repeated postponement of local elections have demoralised councillors and council officials alike and rendered the local government system increasingly irrelevant to people's lives.  This Bill will not stop the rot and the decision yet again to postpone the local elections will worsen matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many respects the Bill represents one of the more barefaced U-turns in our recent political history.  In Opposition, Deputy Dempsey railed against the Rainbow Government's decision to abolish water charges and allocate motor tax to the local authorities.  The same Deputy who told the Dáil on 7 May 1997 that the system of local government should not be towed behind the family car now tells us, one year and five days later, that it is a good idea to allocate motor tax to local authorities.  There is nothing wrong with changing one's mind but on the evidence to date it is not <Col N="1307" /> simply a question of that.  I am certain that when he was in Opposition the Minister recognised the value of what we were doing but in the tradition of Fianna Fáil, opposition for opposition's sake is more important.</P>
    <P>I regard the decision to abolish water charges as one of the more significant achievements of Democratic Left in Government.  The charges were unfair, ill-considered and had met continued resistance since they were introduced in 1983. During the negotiations leading to the formation of the Rainbow Government in 1994, we suggested allocating revenue from motor tax to local authorities as a means of replacing water charges. It was not possible to secure agreement on the proposal at that time but important reforms were introduced, such as establishing a tax allowance for those who paid water charges and greatly limiting the circumstances in which households could be disconnected for non-payment.  We ensured the matter remained on the agenda and were pleased that before it left office the Government was able to introduce legislation abolishing water charges and providing for the retention of car tax by local authorities.  In Opposition, the Progressive Democrats promised they would reintroduce water charges but they have not yet had the courage of their convictions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, any welcome for the Minister's conversion to the system of local government funding which we advocated is tempered by the knowledge that he has made significant changes for the worse to the legislation introduced by the last Government.  The most important and regrettable change is the decision to abolish the local government equalisation fund and the local government equalisation council.  The council was to have included representatives of the local authorities and to have had responsibility for ensuring an equitable disbursement of funds among the authorities.  This was an acknowledgement that local authorities have different population levels and different potentials to raise revenue, and face different problems &mdash; it was an attempt to level the playing pitch.  Not only has the local government equalisation council disappeared from the Bill, the principle of equalisation has also gone.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 6 of the Bill for some sort of advisory committee is so vague regarding its membership and remit as to be virtually useless except, of course, that it concentrates decision-making in regard to funding in his own hands.  Also missing is the provision that would have allowed local authorities, within certain defined limits, to set the level of motor tax for their own areas; in other words to give local councillors some real decision-making power for once. Astonishingly, the Minister has also decided to drop one of the more innovative proposals from the rainbow legislation &mdash; the proposal to establish a local government value for money unit in the Department.  The unit would have been required to improve the manner in which local authorities are managed and secure the provision <Col N="1308" /> of local authority services in a more economical, efficient and effective manner.  Does the Minister believe there is no inefficiency in the local government system?  Does he believe there is no need for improvement in the way local authority services are managed or does he think he can do it all on his own?</P>
    <P>Not contained in the Bill, but a crucial part of the package nevertheless, is the proposal to cap commercial rates at their current level.  The commercial rate was about the only remaining area where a local authority had discretion in raising revenue.  Last year some £338 million was raised in this way.  It is not surprising that a Government which surrendered to the business lobby on Luas, contrary to the interests of public transport users, should also cave in to pressure from the same quarter to cap commercial rates.</P>
    <P>The decision to allocate £270 million to local authorities from central government is welcome but it may not be as generous as it seems.  The Minister acknowledges that the combined motor tax proceeds and Exchequer funding amounts to an increase of £125 million.  Given the extent to which local government services have been allowed to fall into decay since the abolition of domestic rates in 1977, the money may be sufficient to prevent further deterioration but it is unlikely to be sufficient to restore services to an acceptable standard.  What is most unacceptable about the entire direction of the Minister's proposals is that it removes all remaining vestiges of discretion to enable councillors to make decisions locally about how they might raise revenue.  Virtually every report on local government in the past 20 years has emphasised that local councils should not only have greater discretion to determine their overall spending levels but should also have an independent source of revenue.  This is a move towards greater centralisation and away from decentralisation.  The real financial power will remain with the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the Minister with enormous powers.  No criteria are specified in the Bill as to how the local government fund will be allocated. There is no commitment to a fair system or any independent examination of the competing cases of local authorities for funds.  Payments will be made as the Minister considers appropriate.  It is not difficult to envisage a situation in future where an unscrupulous Minister might use the enormous powers he is being given under this Bill to reward local authorities of a similar political disposition or to punish local authorities which refuse to toe the Government's line on some policy issue or other.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to this Bill for a number of reasons, not least the decision to postpone, yet again, local government elections.  When the local elections were last postponed we were told the date for holding future elections would be enshrined in legislation and that there would be no more postponements.  The decision means there will be at least nine years &mdash; almost a decade <Col N="1309" />&mdash; between local elections.  It is now almost 20 years since local elections were last held on schedule and on the last occasion on which they were deferred there was also a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 there have been just two local government elections.  In the same 17 years there have been seven general elections.  The combination of repeated postponement of elections and the withholding of adequate financial resources is bringing the whole system of local government into disrepute.  In the seven years since the local government elections were last held there has been a considerable change in the personnel of many councils as a result of resignations and co-options and many councillors have never faced the electorate.  Population changes in the past eight years mean that many electoral areas have changed dramatically.  The people are entitled to have an election to pass judgment on the performance of councillors on such issues as rezoning.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for the postponement of these elections and I suspect it is being done largely at the behest of the Progressive Democrats.  Regardless of when the elections are held there is an absolute necessity for a total review of all electoral areas to deal with the huge disparity in the ratio of electors to councillors between urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Recent figures show that while there is one councillor per 1,139 of the population in County Leitrim, the figure for Dublin Corporation is one councillor per 9,226 of the population.  Leitrim, with its population of 25,057, elects 22 councillors while the Finglas ward in my constituency, with a population of 32,779, elects just four councillors to Dublin Corporation.  Even allowing for the scattered population in rural areas and in parts of rural Ireland, the disparity is unjustifiable.  The population of Dublin is doubly discriminated against because county councillors and borough councillors also comprise the vast majority of the Seanad electorate; in other words there is one Seanad vote per 1,139 of the population in County Leitrim whereas for parts of Dublin there is one per 11,770.  This may well explain the relative under representation of urban areas in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the boundary review committee announced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will not be able to deal with the problem as it is restricted by its terms of reference to reviewing any disparity between electoral areas within each local authority.  I call on the Minister to establish a full review of all local electoral areas to ensure that electors, urban and rural, enjoy a fair and equitable level of representation.</P>

In response to previous contributions I had to ask my colleague who was in the House at the time &mdash; in case my memory was failing &mdash; if Deputy De Rossa had been a member or a Minister of the previous Government which took the first decision to defer the local elections which should have been held three years ago.  He confirmed that he was in fact a senior Minister at that time.  Yet he is critical of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  Where was the justification for deferring local elections three years ago?

Local elections will no longer be deferred following the enactment of this legislation.  I welcome that development.  On the question of local government being starved of funding, this is hard to take from a person who has just left Government.  I mentioned this last week in the context of health care.  We are being told local government is starved of funding and so on.  Who starved it?  Successive Governments have starved local government of adequate funding.  On the issue of abolishing water charges the direct complaint was linking it to motor tax.  It was suggested, as a means towards buying a few seats in Dublin, which were not bought at the end of the day, that the motorist would have to pay for service charges.  While I was outside the House at the time I thought that was a total contradiction of the policy being implemented by the European Union of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  The motorist was to pay service charges for the person next door.</P>

It is a practical way to ensure roads are repaired.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall pointed out that following the decision by Fianna Fáil in Government to abolish domestic rates in 1977, local authorities had to impose service charges.  He failed to mention that when the Labour Party was in Government the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, introduced legislation on service charges. I initially disagreed with them, but I could not find an alternative, despite the arguments in this House, in the Fianna Fáil Party and elsewhere.  I have accepted them for more than seven years or longer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there are changes in local government.  Funding is the most critical issue and this is the first Government to have faced up to it.  The question of funding was excluded from almost all attempts by Governments of the past 20 years to examine the functioning of local government.  However, the Minister has decided to bite the bullet on this issue.  First, the proposal <Col N="1312" /> to ring-fence the revenue raised from vehicle taxation will mean that it can be used only in specific circumstances, which will prevent its use in all aspects of local government.  Second, the proposal to establish a specific fund is the first of its kind. A similar principle was established in 1977.  It lasted up to 1979 when very high interest rates led to huge demands on central Government which it could not meet.</P>
    <P>In this case the Minister has allocated a specific sum of money.  It will be index linked, which is critically important, and there will be provision for special circumstances and for year on year increases.  That is what local government funding should be about.  There should be specific figures, targets and uses.</P>
    <P>Further changes are required.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have had a stranglehold on financial and legislative provisioning for local government.  Legislation can create difficulties for local authorities.  They are hampered in their ability to act on issues and to react quickly to needs that arise without having to seek ministerial orders or legislative change.</P>
    <P>I have said publicly in Cork that if we obtained three times the funding for road surfacing and repairs from the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, 50 per cent of the same roads would be dug up again because the legislation permits service providers to do as they wish with them, despite the fact that roads and footpaths represent the costliest element of local government.</P>
    <P>A compensation culture has arisen in response to the damage done to our roads.  It costs local authorities approximately £5 million per annum. Every Tom, Dick and Harry is allowed to cut up roads, regardless of whether they are old or new. Some have been in place for less than six months. For example, in my parish in Togher, within six months of the provision of a new bridge and road the road was dug up by the ESB and Bord Gáis. Local governments need the power to prohibit people from digging up road surfaces and footpaths unless it is essential.  It wastes millions of pounds per annum.</P>
    <P>Whereas this House often takes too long to implement measures, local authorities could respond speedily to needs as they arise.  I could detail numerous instances in Cork where roads are more like patchwork quilts following the work of service providers, such as gas, television and so on.  It will cost approximately £70 million to complete the necessary changes and we will lose another £5 million this year on compensation claims.  This legislation is one way to address this problem.  The money will be ring-fenced for use in this area.  A certain amount of wear and tear on roads is inevitable, but it is not a major problem.</P>
    <P>A national policy on signposting is required.  In many instances, signposts create confusion and are a possible danger.  Local authorities should be able to rectify this problem. <Col N="1313" /> The question of help for public transport is meaningfully addressed in the legislation.  Proposed reductions in the tax rates for vehicles, which I welcome, will help in this regard.  There has been an extensive debate on Luas.  Looking at the situation in Dublin from the perspective of the rebel county &mdash; I drive through the city on Tuesdays and Thursdays &mdash; I appreciate some of the difficulties involved.  However, I agree with the principle that Luas must be implemented properly.  There was an almost identical reaction to the postponement of the River Lee tunnel by the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn.  While people alleged it was a delaying tactic the then proposal was for the construction of a two lane tunnel.  He said bluntly that he was not going to create a bottleneck in Cork.  The cost of the project has increased by 47 per cent and the tunnel will open in the next five to six months.  It was the correct decision.  On Luas, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has adopted the correct approach, as has the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in the case of local government.  It takes courage to make decisions such as these.  In celebrating 100 years of local government I hope the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will devolve further powers to local level.  In this context funding is critical.  People will have to pay for services provided locally.  The question of equalisation will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>On non-national roads, there is a specific problem in urban areas about which I have spoken to the Minister.  Approximately £100 million was provided last year.  In the light of the new car tax proposals much can be done to relieve the problem.</P>
    <P>There is wastage of funds.  On the local loans fund, in the past plans produced by local architects had to be forwarded to Dublin for approval. This amounted to duplication.  Changes have been made since but much more could be done.</P>
    <P>The capping of commercial rates has been mentioned.  Two years ago the inflation rate in Cork doubled following a huge increase in commercial rates.  This was accepted by the Cork Chamber of Commerce, among others, on the basis that there would be a spending programme to revitalise the city centre.  The commercial rate-payer should not be seen, however, as an easy target, particularly by those who resent anybody who is successful, who works hard and is rewarded for it.  They should be given a fair crack of the whip to prevent businesses being destroyed.  That is what the Government intends to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall used the emotive phrase &ldquo;shaking off the yoke of central Government&rdquo;.  As a former councillor, I agree that this needs to be done. The first step in that process is the provision of adequate funding.  That will happen for the first time under this Bill, which should be welcomed by all those with a dual mandate.</P>
    <P>There will be a statutory requirement to hold elections every five years.  This is a move in the <Col N="1314" /> right direction.  Elections will not be held at the whim of a Minister, be they a member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Democratic Left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of local government.  In celebrating 100 years of local government it is appropriate that we should discuss the vexed question of local government financing.  Local government has served the country well, often unrecognised.  It has made significant changes in the lives of people and, possibly, a bigger contribution than improvements in the health service, particularly to public health through the provision of clean potable water, sewage disposal facilities, improved housing stock and safe waste disposal facilities.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying local authorities is that a community elects from among its number a number of its own to provide the services it considers are best provided communally.  Local government is based on the notion of community participation, co-operation and contribution but somewhere along the way we have forgotten what it is all about, is supposed to do and represent. Perhaps society has become too complex, populations have become too large and too many services are provided but somehow the sense that a county council is owned by the people has been lost.  People now, understandably, feel remote from organisations which they should believe belong to them.  The final nail in the coffin in this trend was the abolition of rates.  This has produced an attitude, particularly in Dublin, of us and them which will be hard to shift.</P>
      <P>Because of the cutbacks in the 1980s and more recently the rapidly increasing costs of services now required and the higher standards demanded with the growth in functions of local authorities and the rising expectations of the population and the demands it makes of local authorities, local authorities are groaning under the strain.  This is a great tragedy for the elected members and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an age when all kinds of forces are operating to fragment communities, break up families and disconnect people from one another, the local council is the one agency which is ideally poised to counteract this trend and give people a sense of pride and ownership of their area.  Because they lack funding and because of their inability to respond to the changing demands of society and fulfil their statutory duties and functions adequately, the public, particularly in Dublin, feel totally alienated from their councils which are supposed to represent them.  Their good work is completely discounted and their best intentions are regarded with suspicion.  They are regarded, at best, as irrelevant and, at worst, despised.  They have lost all their potential to be dynamic local development agencies and to replace the bonds of family, church and community which previously held society together.  They have lost their potential to be leaders in bringing about sustainable <Col N="1315" /> communities through the local Agenda 21 processes.  However, there are signs of hope, for example, the additional funding under the Bill, although I have reservations about its source.  There is also hope in the introduction of the strategic policy committees.  Without adequate funding and the discretion it gives to local authorities, they will always be deficient in terms of what they do and wish to do.</P>
    <P>I hope the new fund will mean more money and offer more flexibility.  There is a long history of Ministers giving with one hand and taking away with the other and using announcements of additional funding to tighten the hand of central Government.  Members of local authorities could be forgiven for being suspicious and I hope they will not find a sting in the tail regarding the new fund.</P>
    <P>The strategic policy committees are an opportunity to bring the public and their councils together and to give them a sense of identification with each other.  Elected members recognise the potential of the committees and view them as a challenge.  They also view them as an opportunity to rescue local government from complete alienation.  However, whether the partnership approach will be accepted by the public, and particularly those involved in various community development organisations, is another matter. Many people have already engaged productively with their county councils, but others regard and treat their councils with utter disdain.  This is not a good basis for partnership and it must change if the strategic policy committees are to function as intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional funding and the guarantee that funding each year will at least match inflation and be related to the functions and cost base of local authorities.  As members of local authorities are aware, for too long functions have been thrown at local authorities.  This is not only demoralising for the members and their staff but it repeatedly reinforces the public view of the ineptitude of local councils when they fail, as they must inevitably, to fulfil the functions adequately.</P>
    <P>I have serious reservations about the source of the new fund from motor taxation receipts and its method of allocation to local authorities.  It is fundamentally wrong to choose growing car ownership with all its environmental disadvantages as a buoyant tax base to fund bodies whose duty is to protect the environment.  From a traffic reduction point of view, it is not even an efficient tax.  Car ownership already has extremely high associated fixed costs but that has not had the slightest impact on the demand for cars.  I agree with the view that high fixed costs associated with car ownership encourages the use of cars.  People who have already spent so much on their cars are reluctant to leave them sitting outside their doors while they take public transport.  If one wants to reduce travel, the charge must be related to the actual use of the car.  Unlike this measure, such a <Col N="1316" /> charge could be legitimately regarded as an eco tax.</P>
    <P>The second aspect about which I have reservations is the Minister's statement that he has ring-fenced this source of funding for local government.  However, that is not the case.  He has ringfenced the source of funding for the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  If one believes in local democracy, there is a fundamental difference between funding for central Government, irrespective of Department, and funding for local authorities. The Minister should be congratulated for securing the funding from the &ldquo;grab all&rdquo; hands of the Department of Finance.  However, it should not be confused with discretion over the funding of local county councils.  In choosing this method the Minister has lost an opportunity to reinstate the basic principle of local democracy that funds gathered locally should be spent locally.</P>
    <P>It is not clear in the legislation how the money will be disbursed to local authorities.  All we know is that it will be related to performance.  If that is the case, some form of national indicators of performance must be used, but these can never be sensitive to local conditions and individual needs of local authorities.  For example, if a local authority decides one year to spend nothing on roads and to put all its funding into footpaths, it will not come anywhere near an adequate national indicator of performance on roads.  If the authority decides to put all its money into introducing a recycling system, does this mean it will lose its funding next year for footpaths and roads?  Many aspects are unclear.</P>
    <P>The principle of the Department enforcing and policing a value for money regime, which the Minister favours, is fundamentally wrong.  It is a reflection of a totally paternalistic approach to local authorities which assumes that the Department is more concerned about value for money than the county councils.  There is no reason to believe this because the councils involve grown up people who are all concerned about local authorities and how they function.  It is an insult to the members and the people who elect them to assume the Department is more concerned about this area than them.</P>
    <P>The principle of accountability in local democracy is that the elected members are accountable to those who elect them and not to the Minister. Real democracy and discretion means giving county councils the freedom to make mistakes in addition to the freedom to make good decisions. Consequently, in common with the Government, they will either suffer or benefit at the hands of the electorate.  National performance indicators applied across the board will remove the <i>raison d'e tre</i> for local government by reducing their area of discretion and ability to respond to local conditions.  It turns local government into mere cyphers, spending money which is raised by central Government at a level to be decided and chosen by the Government.  To add insult to injury, the Minister raised motor taxation by 6 <Col N="1317" /> per cent but the ire of the public is focused on local authorities which had no part to play in the decision.</P>
    <P>Aside from the undemocratic nature of this method of funding, it is also difficult to understand how local authorities in the coming years can meet their objectives, many of which are set by the Government.  How can they achieve sustainable development objectives without some discretionary eco taxes, incentives or penalties?  Under the new Energy Bill local authorities are required to show how they will reduce energy needs.  Without some mechanisms to encourage certain behaviour and penalise others, short of beating people over the head, I do not understand how we can encourage energy and water conservation, waste reduction, recycling and reduce traffic and other forms of air pollution. These are immediate issues, particularly in Dublin, which is suffering enormous environmental pressures as a result of economic growth.  The Minister is aware of these pressures and he should use the Bill to equip local authorities with the mechanisms to carry through and implement their local Agenda 21 processes as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the context of environmental measures, I draw the Minister's attention to the need to give local authorities power to charge the statutory undertakers for road openings.  The previous speaker mentioned this aspect and I agree with his point.  I cannot overstate the importance of this matter.  At present they are charged for reinstatements; some do it well but others do not. Some leave the most appalling devastation for the local authority to clean up.  This issue is critical in the context of hugely increased traffic levels and, concurrently, the huge increase in investment by the statutory undertakers because of increased demand for their services.  It appears that virtually every road in Dublin is opened simultaneously. Unless some system of charging is introduced to reduce the amount of time they work on the road and to force them to co-operate to reduce the charges, I do not know how Dublin will continue to function.  It is the same in other urban areas.  It is destroying the environment, open spaces, footpaths, roadways and grass verges as well as causing traffic chaos, and local authorities seem powerless to do anything about it.  It is especially critical as there are now more statutory operators. It did not matter during a recession when investment in the country was low and there was little traffic but it matters now.  The same rights were given to Esat when it was awarded its licence. Another licence is about to be issued which means another operator digging up the roads. Will the Minister allow charging to force operators to organise themselves better and finish their work quickly?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill modifying the requirement for professional positions in local authorities to be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.  I do not wish to denigrate the work of the commissioners who have served the <Col N="1318" /> country well for many years and who have removed the possibility of influence in filling positions, but the system is gummed up and not working properly any more.  There are two problems.  First, it is taking too long to recruit replacement staff with the result that projects must be put on hold while replacements are awaited. Second and more importantly, a situation is being created where, for example, an engineer appointed in Dublin can be promoted three months later to Donegal.  For those who stay longer and who want promotion, a local authority often has no choice but to lose them to another authority, thus losing their expertise and local knowledge which they have built up over the years.  While this may have worked in the past, the work in which local authorities are now involved is too complex, important and expensive for that expertise to be lost, for the local authority to be left to cope with the vacuum created and for it to have to wait for the new person recruited to familiarise themselves with the job and with complex and intricate projects.  The Minister did not state the reason for this change in the appointment of professionals but I assume someone informed him of the position and that it is the reason.  It is a change from which we can all benefit and which will introduce greater efficiency in local government.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine changes in the development levies local authorities charge to developers?  At the moment, they can only levy in respect of certain works, usually sewerage or road works or services directly related to a development.  There is a need to grant local authorities greater flexibility in this area to allow for the creation of more sustainable development. An example would be where an open space is not available within a site, something which will become more prevalent as higher density housing is sought.  In such cases, developers could be asked to provide spaces in the area which the local authority could purchase and which would serve the local community rather than the specific development.  Such flexibility is needed to promote better design and orientation, better use of sites and indigenous materials and other factors in creating more sustainable development.  A mechanism is needed to force developers, architects and others involved in developments to formulate more sustainable policies.  There should also be an environmental payback to the local authority where the development has a deleterious effect on the environment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on bringing forward the Bill. Adequate funding is the cornerstone of successful local government and the Bill deals with the funding <Col N="1319" /> issue once and for all.  The funding of local government has been the subject of intense political debate for the past 20 years.  Rates were abolished in 1977 by the Government of the day and this has been the source of considerable debate since.  I recall contesting the local elections in 1985 and water charges were the main issue.  The electorate, particularly in cities, refuse to pay water charges.  The taxes imposed by Governments in the 1980s were perceived by many to be punitive, so the imposition of local charges on top of central taxation was perceived to be unjust and unfair.  Local government needs secure and adequate funding to function properly.  The Bill will allow local authorities to operate within a guaranteed, sustainable and secured base of funding.  A local government fund will be established and the funding will come from the proceeds of motor taxation and an Exchequer contribution amounting to £270 million in 1999.  The total fund in the first year will be £590 million.  This is a welcome development and I am delighted to hear Opposition spokespersons welcome the figure.</P>
      <P>How did local authorities operate in the past?</P>
      <P>They were often put in an impossible situation. On occasion they had to pass their estimates without knowing what the allocation from Government would be.  Ministers often decided to penalise certain local authorities for one reason or another.  That situation was unacceptable and I would go so far as to say it was laughable.  I recall as a member of a local authority that we passed estimates in the hope of receiving a certain figure from central Government when it sorted out its Book of Estimates.  Thankfully, those days are at an end.</P>
      <P>The Government is right to propose the deferment of local elections until 11 June 1999.  A much needed and extensive programme of reform is now being implemented by the Minister.  The current system is over 100 years old and must change or disintegrate.  Population changes mean that electoral areas are in urgent need of revision.  I am delighted a commission has been set up to review the boundaries and I await its report which is due in July.  The last local elections were held in 1991.  The term of office for councillors serving now is eight years.  This should never happen again and it will not if and when this Bill is passed.  The fact that councillors elected in the expectation of serving five years are now serving eight years brings local democracy into disrepute.  Many local authority members today were co-opted to the county or city council. They have not been given a chance to renew their electoral mandate or even obtain one in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the system of co-opting, if a councillor must be replaced one could have a situation where a couple of branches or cumainn, perhaps 21 people in all, would decide who a new city councillor should be.  That is unacceptable.  On a couple of occasions every year we welcome new members to Dublin Corporation, and the time <Col N="1320" /> has come for a local election.  That will take place next year, when we will have a reformed system of government.  People with fresh mandates and policies will be elected and that will breathe new life into our local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of the strategic policy committees and of the area based committees which Dublin City Council is in the process of setting up.  The previous structures were outdated and local government was dying.  The new system will ensure that there is adequate planning and a dynamic response to the rapid changes taking place in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The reforms also mean new roles for the councillors and will enhance their positions.  I share the Minister's hope that young, talented people, particularly women, will be attracted to public office and will present themselves for election next year.  I hope the reforms encourage people to vote in local authority elections.  The system of local government is supposed to be based on the community, and the community's participation is a key element.  If we are to empower communities, we need people to come forward for the local elections.</P>
    <P>The citizens of London recently voted in a referendum to elect their lord mayor directly, and this idea has also been floated for Dublin.  I support this idea because it would ensure that local government in Dublin would become more accountable.  The same would apply to other cities if the plan was extended to them.  Candidates would have to put forward a vision for their city in a programme that would be voted on.  That programme would then have to be implemented over a five-year term.  The mayoral election could be held on the same day as the local elections, when the entire city or county council is being elected.  Obviously the mayor could not be a Senator or Deputy.</P>
    <P>A directly elected lord mayor would have enormous credibility at home and abroad.  Because of that democratic mandate such a mayor would be highly respected and would be a powerful force in the promotion of his or her city.  It goes without saying that the office of lord mayor would have to be given real power and resources.</P>
    <P>Local development agencies are doing very important work in our communities.  They will have to be integrated into the reformed local government system in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability.  Local authorities must also become more customer friendly, which is happening under the new Dublin City Manager's &ldquo;Let's Hear It For Dublin&rdquo; programme.  Community activists are invited to seminars in order to bring in partnership in local government, and this is very welcome.  I agree with all Deputies on the digging of roads by public utilities.  It is a major problem because the roads are not being reinstated properly.  Local authorities will have to be given more powers to not just monitor this work but to ensure that roads, footpaths and grass margins are restored to a satisfactory standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Haughey for sharing his time.  This Bill is part of a major programme for local government renewal.  It has been undertaken by the Minister to ensure local government does not become marginalised.  I congratulate him on his work in this regard.  The Bill's primary purpose is to put in place a new funding system for local authorities which will replace the funding arrangements introduced under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.  It involves the establishment of a local government fund which will be financed by the proceeds of motor taxation and by the Exchequer contributing up to £270 million. The fund will be ring-fenced exclusively for local authorities and the Exchequer contribution will be adjusted annually in the light of changes in the functions of the cost bases of local authorities. The Minister proposes that this new system comes into effect from January 1999.</P>
      <P>This Bill also provides for an increase in motor taxation, for the postponement of local elections until June 1999 and for the modification of professional positions in local authorities in order that they be filled by local appointments commissioners.  When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil published a policy document entitled &ldquo;Real Local Government&rdquo;.  This stated that when in Government Fianna Fáil would introduce a radical new method of funding local government with the proceeds of motor taxation.  Our election manifesto stated that the time had come to give people more control over their affairs at local level. Many people thought promises were being made in Opposition that would not be fulfilled, but we have honoured our commitments.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister speak when he visited our county council.  He visited every council in the 26 counties, for which he must be complimented, and explained the policies he would implement if in Government.  I do not want to embarrass him, but he is recognised as one of the best Ministers for the Environment we have ever had.  He understands the system thoroughly.  He came up the hard way and knows what the people and the councillors want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our programme for Government confirmed our commitment and stressed the need for proper funding for local government and for local discretion on how it is spent.  Section 3 provides for the winding up of the local government equalisation fund and for the establishment of the local government fund.  This will provide a more buoyant system of funding and will be ring-fenced for the sole use of local government, coming into effect on 1 January 1999.  This fund will amount to £590 million and will be financed from two sources, the proceeds of motor taxation which will be primarily used to fund the restoration programme for non-national roads, creating a clear link between motor taxation and the upkeep of our roads, and an Exchequer contribution of £270 million in the first year, 1999.  That figure will be adjusted in line with inflation and to reflect changes in the functions of local authorities.  The <Col N="1322" /> Bill is praiseworthy because it ensures for the first time revenue from motor taxation will be set aside for its original purpose, the upkeep of non-national roads.</P>
    <P>I am sure the majority of complaints the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Members receive relate to the deterioration in the condition of non-national roads.  During his first year in office the Minister made a substantial increase in the allocation for non-national roads, but there are still problems.  I would like to mention a telephone complaint I received from a constituent about certain roads in the eastern part of my constituency.  That constituent did not speak kindly to me or about the Minister.  However, the Minister has had the guts to grasp the nettle in relation to this matter.  I recall a former Minister when addressing my county council not so long ago saying that reform of local government was due but he did not know who was prepared to grasp the nettle in that regard.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation motor tax is firmly linked to the upkeep of our road network.  This Bill ends the anomaly that prevailed in previous years when the proceeds of motor tax were used for purposes other than for the upkeep of our roads. While this will involve increasing the overall rates of motor tax, that will be done on a phased basis by an increase of 3 per cent on the passage of this legislation and by a further 3 per cent on 1 January 1999.  There will be reductions in the rates applying to public service vehicles, a change which the Minister pointed out will benefit many voluntary groups, with limited resources, who run minibuses and coaches.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures local authorities will have an extra £125 million, a 27 per cent increase over the 1997 provision, to meet their day-to-day expenditure.  Business will benefit by way of this Bill through the availability of better infrastructure and the enhanced ability of local government to deal with priorities.</P>
    <P>The new funding provided by the Minister will enable the Government to introduce a cap on increases in commercial rates in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. That point was adequately covered by previous speakers.  We all remember when the commercial rate was increased by 12 per cent at a time when the rate of inflation was only 3 per cent.  This new funding base for local government, with the ever increasing successful value for money drive initiated by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, which includes exploring new ways of working, eliminating outdated bureaucratic practices and making the best use of modern technology, will allow local authorities to play a much more significant role in everyone's daily life by consistently providing quality services for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide local elections will be held in June 1999 and every five years thereafter in conjunction with the European elections. The Minister is in the process of putting in place a substantial body of legislation, which is badly <Col N="1323" /> needed, to underpin the process of local government reform.  It is important the general outline of the new local government system should be known before the electorate is asked to decide who should represent it.  This is true democracy. Time is needed to undertake the proper revision of local election constituencies.  The Minister set up a commission to report on this matter.  Such a revision has not been carried out since 1985, but census results show electoral areas are in serious need of revision due to demographic changes.  I congratulate the Minister on the magnificent work he is doing in his ministry.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  It is a small step towards increasing the role and power of local government, but there is nothing radically new in the Bill.  A similar proposal was brought forward by the previous Government, but the same discretion with regard to the application of an increase in the motor tax rate is not evident in this Bill.  I generally welcome the Bill because for too long local government has become less and less relevant here.  Any movement to strengthen it and make it more relevant to the people is to be welcomed.  The key to doing that is to ensure local government has a function in collecting taxes.  The Minister indicated at a meeting in Limerick that this legislation would be a step towards further development of local government and I urge him to move in that direction because local government is vital to communities, democracy and those of us who have been involved in it for many years know how important it is to localities. Often councillors are not considered to have much power or influence, but are viewed as people to whom to make complaints.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins raised the issue of the condition of our roads, an issue that has plagued us for many years, but I acknowledge the improvements made since 1995.  The Government allocation to Limerick County Council for roads decreased every year from 1992 to 1995, but it increased from £2.2 million to £4.1 million in 1995, to £4.8 million in 1996, to £6 million in 1997 and the Minister increased the allocation to £7 million this year.  The previous Government and this Government have made an effort to ensure the condition of regional and country roads is improved.  However, as the previous speaker said, this is not enough because the condition of our roads was allowed to deteriorate to too great an extent initially and there has been a huge increase in the volume of road traffic.  I urge the Minister to ensure the increase in the road allocation to Limerick County Council will continue apace in future years.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of landfill sites, on which we should have a more coherent policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> This issue is a problem throughout the country. Members who listen to local radio stations while travelling to the Dáil will often hear a debate on problems surrounding those sites.  I attended a meeting in Clare last night at which this issue was raised.  We need a national policy on landfill sites. Many problems arise because landfill sites have not been maintained at an environmentally acceptable standard in keeping with the right of people to enjoy the environment in which they live.  Many problems have surrounded the landfill site in Gortadromma in the western part of my constituency, but we are overcoming them.  I ask the Minister to make the necessary resources available to ensure that it and other landfill sites are maintained at the standard dictated by Europe or above it because this issue is a hot potato at local level.  Nobody wants them but everybody produces refuse.  There is an urgency in County Limerick because of the closure of the city landfill site.  This is a growing crisis.</P>
    <P>There are almost 1,000 applicants for housing in the Limerick council area.  The Celtic tiger does not appear to be addressing this problem. Even though there is an increase in the standard of living, it has not touched a section of society. The problem is not with housing alone but also with the improvement of housing stock.  There are difficulties with repairs and more finance should be given to that.</P>
    <P>Shared ownership is becoming more successful and is having more of an impact in resolving the housing crisis.  However, some people cannot afford to take out loans and finance must be given to that area.  The concept of social housing is a brilliant one but it is totally underutilised.  I have raised this at council level and have been paid some lip service.  Social housing could play a bigger role in the improvement of houses.</P>
    <P>For example, I know of a house which could be improved by the provision of a bathroom and some dry lining.  This would be a comfortable house for a couple in their early 50s who could live there for the rest of their lives.  The area of planning must also be looked at, to ensure that rural Ireland survives and does not become a barren area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill, the primary purpose of which is to put in place a new funding system for local authorities. This is an excellent concept which could lead to regional authorities providing the statistics for Objective One.  The devolution policy is also a great start.  The fund will be ring-fenced exclusively for local authority purposes.  It is important that this is enforced.  I have great respect for local authorities, county managers and those doing fantastic work in counties.  It is good that they will have a source of funding with which they can identify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates is another form of funding for local authorities.  The business community are the only property dwellers taxed indirectly, although some of it is tax allowable.  The rates system is dated <Col N="1325" /> and needs upgrading.  If the Minister could look at this, it would be appreciated by the business community.  Having spoken to numerous business people, I know that regardless of their profitability they must pay rates.</P>
    <P>Sligo avails of INTERREG road funding which is incorporated in the EU co-financed allocation. This should be additional.  With the huge growth in tourism, additional funding should be a top-up, particularly in Sligo.  The consultant's report, issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, established Sligo as one of the counties with the worst road conditions in the country.  This is one of the reasons INTERREG funding should be additional to the EU co-financed funding.</P>
    <P>Seventy per cent of local primary roads in Sligo require reconstruction or surface restoration. Only 17 per cent of the local primary road system is considered adequate.  At current funding levels, the council will be unable to deal with accumulated deficiencies and keep pace with the ongoing deterioration in the ten year programme.  The ten year investment in the restoration is clear evidence of the lack of follow-up maintenance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can look at the conditions attached to the restoration grants, which are extremely restrictive.  They preclude routine maintenance, which is important.  Analysis of the council's investment in non-national roads has shown a decrease from £1 million in 1986 to £369,000 in 1997.  This will result in the reapportioning of funding to non-national roads restoration and an increase will be necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated, based on this study, that Sligo should receive a 16 per cent increase in existing funds to achieve its appropriate share. This Bill is a major step forward, but I ask the Minister to look at the problem of INTERREG funding.  I discussed this matter with the county manager.  The council is being penalised, which should not be the case.</P>
    <P>Ongoing maintenance, such as drainage and pothole repair must take place if the investment is to be protected and value for money achieved. The council's contribution must be increased to a realistic level and there must be a relaxation in grant conditions to allow a portion of funding to be applied to routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>We welcome the huge investment in the motorway from Carraroe to Sligo.  However, it is disappointing for the large number of people who travel on local and non-national roads to see the lack of maintenance funding for pothole repair.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the additionality of INTERREG funding.  If this could be achieved, it would bring substantial funding to Sligo.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Gabhaim buíochas do Theachta Perry agus do Theachta Neville.  The funding of local authorities has been considerably and scandalously neglected for a decade and a half.  Local authorities were systematically starved, dating back to 1983 at least, when the <Col N="1326" /> link was broken between the rates support grant and the amount domestic rates, as existed until 1978, would have brought into local authorities. This had devastating consequences for the services of local authorities and the population dependent upon them.</P>
      <P>Staff levels were devastatingly cut in local authorities throughout the country.  Dublin County Council, which was a massively expanding area, suffered hundreds of job losses.  This had huge consequences on services.  Communities in local authority housing areas were disgracefully neglected and allowed to become rundown in the most shameful fashion.  They had expanding populations, virtually no facilities and were built on greenfield sites where people were left in the wilderness.  Undoubtedly, in the suburbs of Dublin in particular that was a contributory factor to the heroin crisis that bedevils communities.</P>
      <P>The crisis in housing generally results from lack of investment.  There is a particular crisis in local authority housing.  Fingal County Council receives funding for 90 new homes per year while there are 1,500 families on the housing list.  South Dublin County Council receives funding for 105 new houses per year while there are more than 2,000 people on the housing lists.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not provide for those on the housing list.  The Minister should recognise that this is an emergency.</P>
      <P>Because of the shortage of funding for public housing and the consequent pressure, profiteering by house builders and developers on the one hand and opportunism by speculators on the other is rampant.  It was revealed in the High Court yesterday that one firm of builders dashed the hopes of young house buyers by pushing up the price of the house on which they had paid a deposit by a massive £36,000 from the original price agreed a few months earlier.  Surely that is legalised racketeering on a scale that would be scarcely found in the black economy of a war zone let alone in what is supposed to be a civilised State.</P>
      <P>The increase in house prices is not due to an increase in the price of materials and it is certainly not due to massively increased wages for building workers, it is due to sheer naked greed. Successive Governments have sat on their hands and watched this new breed of carpet-bagger take hold in the housing market with devastating consequences and suffering for ordinary working class people.  The Minister should address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals brought forward in the context of the Bacon report will not address the problem. I ask the Minister to make emergency funding available to end local authority housing lists by extending the shared ownership scheme.  Workers on the average industrial wage are incapable of buying the cheapest new home in Dublin because the price is way outside their range.  The measures introduced by the Minister may slow the rate of increase in house prices but they will not bring them down to the level of the ordinary working <Col N="1327" /> person.  The shared ownership scheme is paralysed for workers on the average industrial wage because they cannot make repayments according to the standards laid down by local authorities. These are burning questions which I ask the Minister to address in the context of this discussion.</P>
    <P>While local authority funding was being run down, hundreds of millions of pounds were handed back to privileged sectors in society.  That money could have been used to develop local services and housing.  The 1987 Fianna Fáil Government and the 1994 Fianna Fáil-Labour Government handed back up to £1,000 million in the two tax amnesties awarded to the super rich, while at the same time local authorities were starved of funding.  Those Governments had no hesitation in soaking the PAYE worker to make up the difference, particularly in the form of water, sewerage and refuse charges, a parallel system of local taxation to make the ordinary person fill the hole left by the dereliction of the wealthy and the loopholes availed of by big business, financial institutions and the super rich in avoiding taxes.</P>
    <P>Water charges were a hated double taxation. The PAYE taxpayers, the compliant, decent taxpayers, found expression for their just anger and opposition to these charges, not only in Dublin but throughout the country in organisations such as the Cork Householders Against Service Charges, the Tipperary Unemployed and Workers' Group and the Federation of Dublin Anti-Water Charges Campaign.</P>
    <P>Justice is not served by the fact that decent householders are still dragged before the courts for arrears of water charges.  Just as an amnesty was offered to the super rich a few years ago, the Minister should send a signal to local authorities to stop this persecution.  That would be justice for those who have funded and still fund the bulk of this system.  County managers should be asked to call off the persecution of decent taxpayers who are being dragged into court on a monthly basis for arrears of a discredited and now abolished tax.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is remarkable that in this debate and on many issues relating to local government funding there is frequently much agreement and a unity of purpose among Deputies.  Obviously we will not agree on everything, but the spirit of the contributions by Deputies on all sides of the House indicates the need for reform of and provision of funding for local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was introduced primarily to deliver on promises made when we were in Opposition.  It meets the overall commitment set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium to put local government funding on a better footing.  In doing so we will protect the future of local government and ensure local authorities not only survive but become modern, efficient, responsive <Col N="1328" /> organisations.  Everybody in the House agrees such a Bill was necessary.  Local authority finances had reached the stage in the past 20 years where, if something was not done, local government would have been in a serious position.  As I said at several local authority meetings, if we were not prepared to tackle this issue we should abandon the whole system of local government and concentrate on a properly centralised system, although that is not my preference.</P>
    <P>The major bone of contention among local authority members with the current funding system is that the amount of money for current expenditure purposes is insufficient and that no mechanism is in place to ensure buoyancy in motor tax is not eaten up by increases in the cost base of local authorities or by the conferral of additional functions on them.  They are the two main problems I had with the system introduced by the previous Government.  I have no difficulty acknowledging that my predecessor made efforts to rectify the position of local government financing, but there were shortcomings in that regard. The two drawbacks to which I referred would have meant that in the coming years the financial position of local authorities would have become steadily worse and they would be back to the position in which they were some time ago.</P>
    <P>The estimated provision under the new funding system will be £590 million.  That will be made up of an Exchequer contribution of £270 million as well as receipts from motor tax, estimated at about £320 million.  Despite Deputy Dukes's calculations that the new funding system would deliver only £20 million, I am pleased that an extra £125 million will be available to local government from the beginning of January 1999.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate to the House that on Committee Stage I intend to introduce a gratuity system for members of local authorities who are to retire.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to approve the Luas proposal as designed involving the loss of £114 million in Structural Funds to this project and thereby prolonging the very severe traffic congestion problems of Dublin indefinitely and further deplores the manner in which the Government has announced a plan which is uncosted, has no technical design or specification and for which there is no timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard the Government's decision on this matter last week after a lengthy and fractious Cabinet meeting I was shocked.  I said then, and time will bear it out, that this is the worst decision the Government has taken since it took office.  Traffic congestion is the primary political problem for most Dubliners.  There was a time when crime was the biggest problem. However, the daily frustration, aggression and anger people feel at having to get up earlier and get home from work later due to traffic gridlock is affecting greatly the quality of life for people in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the cost of traffic gridlock in delay alone, leaving aside fuel, pollution and accident costs, is £500 million per annum.  The morning rush hour used to be from 7.45 a.m. to 9.15 a.m. but it has been extended to at least 7.15 a.m. to 10 a.m. The problem can only worsen.  The growth in population projected for the greater Dublin area and for the peripheral counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow indicates that travel journeys will increase.  Since 1990 it is estimated that travel journeys in Dublin have doubled.</P>
      <P>Given the urgency of this crisis, the analysis we have had for the past ten years and the almost inexhaustible supply of reports it is incomprehensible that this Government has deliberately deferred the revitalised transport system for Dublin in the Luas proposals.  The expert reports and consultative studies came to a central conclusion &mdash; the solution to Dublin's traffic gridlock lies in a modal shift from private motoring to public transport.  We must get people out of cars into vehicles which make efficient use of road space, be they heavy or light rail or buses.  Road space is finite and it cannot cope with the exponential growth in demand.</P>
      <P>The Luas project with lines from Dundrum and Tallaght to the city centre had its limitations.  Its proponents always acknowledged that it was not a panacea for Dublin's traffic congestion.  Rather it was part of a comprehensive DTI package.  I resent the out of context use of the statistic in the Atkins report that Luas would only have brought about a 1 per cent shift from private motoring to public transport.  That is true because there are 11 radial routes in Dublin and Luas only dealt with two of them.  However, for those two routes from Dundrum and Tallaght it would have effected a 15 per cent shift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the DART route one in two commuters goes to work by public transport but on the rest of the city routes less than one in four does so. The objective must be to raise the figure on all those routes to one in two.  That would have happened on the Dundrum and Tallaght lines.  As the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme showed, the buses are full halfway into their journeys because there is inadequate capacity and many motorists have <Col N="1330" /> little option given the lack of quality bus corridors.</P>
    <P>The Government has stretched credulity on this issue and its approach has not worked.  The Minister created a deception through the Atkins report.  She emphasised repeatedly that another examination by an independent group of experts was needed before Luas was signed off.  We disagreed with the delay and argued that it would jeopardise the funds.  However, it was a new Government and it was entitled to hear from its experts before committing itself to such large expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us repeatedly at Question Time that the EU funding would not be lost. However, we know that a secret meeting took place on 2 January between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister and it was known all along that the Luas project was to be abandoned. When the Atkins report recommended the existing proposal as the best option she and her Government colleagues clutched at soundbites, such as the 1 per cent figure, to draw a different conclusion.</P>
    <P>Hurriedly and in a confused manner the Government drew up its own Dublin transport blueprint.  It had various vested interests spin this stunt into a visionary project and a panacea for Dublin's traffic woes.  That mirage is collapsing. The reality is that we have awakened not to a vision but to a nightmare.  We have ended up with a project for which there has been no technical appraisal ten years after the DTI began, let alone a detailed route, underground or overground, or a specification.  The project has no phasing and no start or completion dates.  It is uncosted and I am told by experts that the full cost is likely to be about £1.2 billion.</P>
    <P>The Atkins report stated that the earliest an underground system would be available to the Dublin commuters would be 2005.  By then there will have been a further 20 per cent increase in traffic journeys in the Dublin area.  We are told that the Government is committed to an underground tunnel in the city centre.  We do not know its depth, the subsidence risk or the geological problems.  Given the construction activities in Dublin over the past 20 years, I would give the project about ten boreholes before a professor finds another Wood Quay site.  Halfway through the tunnelling a prehistoric find will be discovered that must be examined with a tooth-brush.  This project will be a black hole into which will pour the Minister's political epitaph.  It is a pig in a poke if ever there was one.</P>
    <P>There will have to be 130 bore holes to analyse the rock structure under the city centre and, in some cases, up to a depth of 60 metres.  Houses, offices and shops will be disrupted by these large bore holes.  Some hydrologists and geologists have said a former river structure involving up to seven rivers existed under the city centre and this will lead to severe problems of sand and sediment.  I can put it no better than a geologist <Col N="1331" /> expert who said it is like drilling into a water main.</P>
    <P>The Minister, blithely and bizarrely, is not only unable to answer any of these questions relating to design, cost and timetable, she even has the outrageous temerity to pretend this project, in its totality, will cost in the order of £400 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Atkins report estimated that the cost of the city centre tunnel and the previous online Luas proposal would be of the order of £363 million.  Are we to believe we can get spurs and extensions of the onstreet system to Ballymun, the airport and Finglas, across to the docklands, linking Dublin's heavy rail stations, back to Cabinteely and out to Swords for £30 million or £40 million on top of £363 million?  It is absolute nonsense.  The truth is the Government does not have a clue what this will cost or when it will be done, if ever.</P>
      <P>Various kites have been flown as to the method of funding of this Disneyland deception.  We were told there will be the proceeds of the sale of semi-State assets, including ICC, ACC and the IPO from Telecom Éireann.  We were told the private sector as far away as Japan is queuing up to fund it.  This is not proper Government procedure.  The Department of Finance controls the annual public capital programme.  The constraints in the future will be greater, not less.  Because of the single currency, there will be annual limitations on public expenditure, the current budget deficit and the national debt.  Structural Funds will be reduced after 1999, irrespective of whether the entire country or part of it retains Objective One status.</P>
      <P>There will have to be a rate of return on capital for private sector funding, as with a toll road or any joint funded project.  This will probably exceed the rates at which Governments can borrow money.  We have long experience, through successive Governments, of transport &mdash; CIE &mdash; requiring a public subsidy.  On top of that annual subvention &mdash; in some cases, as with Dublin Bus, the subvention is not enough &mdash; we will have to repay this capital to the private sector finance.  It is not funny money or money which does not have an annual current cost.  The only certainties of the Government's decision to abort Luas are that Dublin's traffic gridlock will receive no practical resolution in the form of the proposed public transport for over eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public inquiry will have to be terminated <Col N="1332" /> and a new ministerial order put in place as the route will have to be redesigned from scratch in some cases.  The European funding agreed with the previous Government and the Commission of £114 million will be lost to the project.  I support the amendment tabled by the Labour Party ensuring that, as an outcome of this disaster or as a consolation prize, the money will be retained for transport projects in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit surprised many Ministers supported the proposal because they saw that after the mid-term review most did not get what they wanted in terms of extra Structural Funding from agriculture to heritage to enterprise and employment.  They will all have their hands out for the £114 million.  It is no wonder they wilfully supported the Minister in dropping that European funding.</P>
    <P>How can Fianna Fáil and PD Deputies representing the Tallaght and Dundrum areas vote for this Government cock-up?  This must mark itself as the worst decision the Government has taken since elected to office.  It was a decision based on the gutless cowardice of avoiding any construction disruption this side of a general election.  When researching my party's document, Capital Crisis, last autumn, a senior business source asked me privately if I really thought someone as cute and cunning as the Taoiseach would allow the streets of Dublin to be ripped up for the next general election.  He told me to cop myself on and said that there is no way the Taoiseach would tolerate the political backlash in an election campaign.  I naively discounted such a short-term prospect of expediency ruling the day. This politics of cuteness and cunning will rebound on this Government because by the next election, Dublin voters will see it has done nothing to deal with traffic chaos.  The Government has dressed up a non-decision as a bigger and brighter transport project.  This stunt will haunt this Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is happy to support the proposal that £114 million of lost European funds should be diverted back to public transport needs in the greater Dublin area.  We have outlined proposals, including £10 million for quality bus corridors, construction of park and ride facilities, the improvement of heavy rail links from Kilcock to Connolly Station, from Maynooth to Clonsilla and to and from Heuston Station.  Dublin Corporation's traffic management has put forward an investment programme.  These measures are urgent and necessitous but they do not take from the overriding need to provide an enhanced public transport system on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>This Government's cop-out and cowardice will become apparent with each passing and planning implementation phase of its proposals.  Fine Gael believes the Government has engaged in a con trick and hoax of the worst order.  It is only a matter of time before the cheated motorist has pay back time with this Government in the next election on this crucial issue.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the most masterly stroke of deception ever perpetrated on the people of Dublin.  Although she has scuttled any hope for this generation of a public transport system, the Minister is still selling it as something better than they already had within their grasp.  As a spin, it is admirable and breathtaking in its audacity.  The Minister has traded the reality of a planned and immediately implementable and designed system for what is a fairy tale.  History has a habit of disproving even the most credible fairy tales and when the history of this issue is written, it will prove that last week's bombshell was a bad day for Dublin.  It will also have been a bad day for the Minister unless she rapidly introduces and implements interim measures, otherwise this decision will come back to haunt her.</P>

      <P>We will see.  This is unfortunate because it was not what the Minister wanted and was forced on her by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  As recently as ten to 14 days ago, the Minister said she would accept the Atkins report but she was forced to accept a completely new scheme proposed by a friend of the Tánaiste.  I believe the Minister when she says that every member of the Cabinet had their say because the scheme and the lovely colourful map produced last week has signs of everyone's hand.  It is a mishmash of everything which was suggested over the past 20 years in terms of a train or light rail system.  There are lines to Tallaght, Sandyford, Connolly Station, the airport, Clondalkin, Cabinteely, the Docklands and Swords and an on-street and underground system.  No matter where one lives, what one wants or what one's interest is, there is a little appeasement for everyone. There is something for everybody in the audience except the audience has not been born yet and that is the rub.  It provides nothing for Dubliners, especially those in the city centre and the long suffering suburbs.  This plan presents no immediate hope for traffic relief, no interim relief and for most of us there will be no relief in our lifetimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It resulted from the ultimate political cop-out by the Cabinet as it bowed to vested interests and was afraid of any on street disruption prior to a general election.  This was done for short-term gain as the Government ignored every recommendation, study, consultants' report and expert, including those commissioned by the Minister who took a year to produce a report which she then threw away.  Five years of design work has been thrown out and the Luas team who worked diligently for five years on a plan which no longer exists are completely demoralised.  The Dublin Transportation Office, which produced the DTI strategy and is revising it, had all the local authorities <Col N="1334" /> working to the same agenda now find the plug has been pulled on the core element of its strategy.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister made the point that the Government was agreeing to the implementation of environmental traffic cells in the city but failed to realise their purpose is to facilitate public transport.  If there is no public transport, there is no point in having them.  Local authorities in Dublin have built their development plans around the Dublin transportation strategy and this was ignored.  My local authority has already allocated higher density developments along planned public transport routes but now we find that is no longer the case and do not know when it will happen.</P>
    <P>What confidence can the public have in a Government that throws out this amount of work and then sits down to design a Legoland public transport system?  What confidence can we have in a Government which a few weeks ago was accepting the on-street system for which work was done and this week is selling Telecom Éireann for a totally new system, designed partly by it and the Tánaiste's friends, against the advice of the Minister for Finance who apparently had already committed the Telecom funds to reducing the national debt?</P>
    <P>I was amused when I received a glossy document from the Department of Finance on its strategy up until 2000.  That is gone out of the window.</P>

      <P>I must tell the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Public Enterprise will have to forgive us for believing that she is making this up as she goes along.  The scheme, apart from the indeterminate tunnel is not that different from the previous one but the stop-start approach to it is damaging, wrong and totally reprehensible, especially the overturning of a detailed plan causing years of delays to satisfy a vested interest.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was also behind this and it is not the first time he has interfered on behalf of a vested interest in regard to public transport.  Does anybody recall the taxi forum where the work of the Dublin local authorities was completely over-turned for one vested interest?  He was wrong on both occasions and this will be proven.  Lobbying is a legitimate activity for any group, including taxi drivers, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the loose alliance of consultants who have been wandering around with various schemes over recent years but it is the duty of Government to legislate for the common good, and not for one group.  The common good was not well served last week through this decision.  It was the wrong decision functionally and politically for Fianna Fáil, whatever the Taoiseach may think. Dublin Chamber of Commerce may have a great deal of muscle but it has only a handful of votes.</P>

It is an anger that is very close to revolution and the Government has effectively spat in the face of those who thought they had a solution within their grasp and relief was close at hand.  The irony of this volte face is that it is to no avail because the tunnel will never be built.  The Taoiseach and the Minister know this and already signalled this when they factored the expectation of delays and court challenges into the time span involved.  It is unique in terms of the public projects with which I have been involved at local government level.  A Government has never announced a project that it knew the public would not like and to which it would object without providing any costing.</P>

      <P>The public will not like it when, having wasted many years and millions of pounds, it will suddenly realise what is involved in this project.  When the public realises the tunnel will not serve the city centre, will take people away from it, there will be massive disruption in building even one underground station, the chaos of shifting millions of tonnes of rock through the city streets and the cost, risk, uncertainty involved, there will be objections, lobbying and threatened court challenges like we have never seen before.  The very people objecting will be the same people for whom this new scheme was conceived.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The spine chilling scenario is that when that happens the Government will bow to pressure again, abandon the new plan and everyone will be back to the drawing board. However, long before that happens, Dublin will have completely ground to a halt, the economy will be destroyed and there will be a new set of problems to contend with, the very least of which will be how we get people from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.</P>
      <P>However, knowing the intolerable position in which the Minister has been placed by the Tánaiste, I was impressed with the spin but one week later it is beginning to unravel a little.  She stretched our ability to believe a little too far when she parcelled all the lines ever dreamt up together, extended them in a few directions and went underground as well; even her supporters found that a little difficult to believe.  Already people living on the northside of the city realise they have been sold a pup and that they have traded the certainty of phase two in the previous project for a fantasy, the remote possibility of a tunnel appearing in Broadstone in their lifetimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the dust settles, the Minister will have to pick up the pieces and make choices to salvage something from this fiasco.  The latest predictions from the Dublin Transportation Office are <Col N="1336" /> nothing short of frightening and we cannot spend five years drilling holes in the ground to no avail. The Minister must proceed immediately with the Tallaght &mdash; O'Connell Street and Sandyford &mdash; St. Stephen's Green lines and allow them to open and operate independently of work on tunnels. We do not want to know about tunnels and are only interested in what can be opened now.</P>
    <P>The Minister must immediately resource Dublin Bus and equip it to meet demand.  It is, and always will be, the main public transport provider.  It was never true that Luas would be the total solution.  We need more buses and routes to deal with the change in demand patterns for travel which has been recognised by Dublin Bus, but it has not been in a position to respond.  Over the past five years there have been enormous changes due to changing land use and population and economic growth.  Those changes are causing chaos in the suburbs and the new demands can be met only by a comprehensive network of orbital bus routes.</P>
    <P>The Minister must provide funding immediately for the construction and policing of quality bus corridors, park and ride facilities, the Maynooth line and all the other interim measures recommended by the Dublin Transportation Office.  Those are the minimum measures necessary to prevent a complete breakdown of the Dublin transport network.  They are the minimum measures needed to even stay at the current level of congestion, a frightening thought.  I sympathise with the Minister because she has to do all this as well as build two Luas lines without EU funding. It gives me no pleasure to say I told her so, but I did.</P>
    <P>Ihope the Minister had an opportunity in the past week to consider some of the questions she could not answer last week.  While I have several questions I want to ask her, I will concentrate on a parochial issue.  What is the position in regard to the Sandyford-Stephen's Green line?  While I realise changes are necessary to the light rail application and that a fresh order will have to be prepared, will it be ready when the inspector opens his public inquiry, which is rumoured will take place in the autumn?  Will it proceed in tandem with the Tallaght line?  Will the carriages for which tenders have already been sought be suitable for the Sandyford line?  Will they have the capacity to serve what is supposed to be an airport route?  Will they meet the fire standards required for the tunnel route?  In short, will the tunnelling consideration delay progress on that portion of the line or can it proceed and open as scheduled in 2002?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for sharing time with me.  Given my involvement with Luas in the previous Government, I believe I can speak with some authority on this issue.  As Minister responsible for transport, I launched the successful public consultation process in December l995 and brought forward legislation to make Luas possible in July l996 which was steered through <Col N="1337" /> the Oireachtas by the then Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  I also negotiated and secured approval for the allocation of £114 million of European Union funding for the project.  I was proud to be associated with the on-street Luas project during my time in office and I strongly endorse the project which is practical and a realistic attempt to address Dublin's traffic problems.  This is in contrast to the aspirational and elaborate charade being indulged in by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Luas project has been studied to death and the Dublin Transport Initiative has, in effect, been buried with it by the Government.  In the past five years a number of distinguished international transportation consultants have exhaustively evaluated the options for Luas.  All their advice, plus the collective recommendations of such bodies as the DTI, Dublin Corporation, CIE and relevant Government Departments, have strongly supported the original on-street Luas project for Dublin.  This advice has been rubbished by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and her Government colleagues, although I note reports that Ministers Cowen and Brennan &mdash; no doubt arising from their personal experiences as former Ministers with responsibility for transport &mdash; support the on-street light rail system and are backed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>What confidence can the people of Dublin have in the commitment of the Minister for Public Enterprise to this project?  She told the House on several occasions, and repeated it at innumerable transport gatherings in the past 12 months, that regardless of the outcome of the Atkins consultancy  study, the Government would implement the project recommended by it.  That is some commitment on implementation.  The Luas project proposed by the Government is a pipe dream and constitutes a cocktail of dithering, fudging and passing the buck.  There are no realistic costs for the project, funds have not been locked down for it and neither a start nor a completion date has been set.  That is a ludicrous basis for a Government to proceed with a project.  Is there any understanding in Government circles of the implications of such an approach for our reputation in Europe as a country that can be relied on to deliver on our European Union Structural Fund commitments?  In the case of Luas that reputation lies in tatters.  Brussels has undoubtedly become weary of the endless delays and cop-outs on the project.  The Minister has admitted this by meekly giving up the £114 million of European Union funding for it.</P>
      <P>Up to £20 million of European Union funding has already been spent on planning and design work for a system which has been scrapped by the Government.  During my time as Minister I recall being advised by the European Union authorities that the funds being spent on planning and design work would have to be refunded if the on-street project did not go ahead.  Will the Minister enlighten the House on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In announcing the new project with customary <Col N="1338" /> fanfare and her magic crayon, the Minister claimed the project will cost £400 million plus. Unfortunately, she has been steadfast and characteristically vague about how much &ldquo;plus&rdquo; means. On the basis of the technical advice available to me about the project during my time as Minister, I am satisfied the final outturn cost will be closer to £800 million.  The House should note in this context that the projected cost for the underground Dublin Port access tunnel is running in excess of £200 million, or two-and-a-half times the original figure, before even a shovel of earth has been dug.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects about which the Minister has also been noticeably vague.  For example, from where will the funds come?  It is obvious there is no formal Government decision to allocate Exchequer funding to the programme.  References which the Minister made to the public capital programme do not give any comfort in this connection.  The entire episode smacks of a questionable system of Government procedure.  Now that the European Union funds for Luas have gone, who will fund the necessary work to bring the new project forward?  It is obvious that at least another £20 million will be needed for technical and evaluation work on the new scheme.  Has the Minister made provision for this expenditure or secured the Government's approval for the additional funds?</P>
    <P>There are so many imponderables about the underground option it is no wonder the Minister for Finance is apparently having nightmares about the project.  Any Minister for Finance would have nightmares about the spectre of more Wood Quays, massive compensation payments, flooding, possible damage to public and other historic buildings between St. Stephen's Green and Broadstone and a large unquantified financial black hole looming large on the horizon into which all the experts agree money will have to be poured.  The lack of detail about the Government's proposal is extraordinary for a project of such magnitude and importance to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>How many underground stations are envisaged by the Government?  The Atkins report assumed three stations in its analysis.  In l996 I was advised by the Department's technical experts that one underground station would cost at least £30 million and that each station's size would be roughly equivalent to placing Liberty Hall on its side underground.  We are told underground stations will not cause disruption.  In broader transportation terms, the cost of one underground station would be sufficient to enable Dublin Bus to buy more than 200 buses which would do wonders for its ability to provide a proper bus service for the people of Dublin.  This extra fleet, with the implementation of the DTI's recommendation for 11 quality bus corridors, would make a significant difference to public transport users.</P>
    <P>Great store was placed in media reports over the weekend on the opposition by Dublin Chamber of Commerce to on-street light rail and <Col N="1339" /> the pressure exerted by it on Government.  I am baffled by the Government's capitulation, lack of courage and leadership in this regard.  During my time as Minister certain elements within Dublin Chamber of Commerce exercised similar opposition to Luas, but we were careful to also ascertain the views of other business representative bodies, such as Dublin City Business Association, the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Dundrum Chamber of Commerce and Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce, who together represent more than 800 businesses and some 20,000 employees.  All these bodies were strongly supportive of the on-street solution.</P>
    <P>Nothing less than the allocation of the £220 million for the substitute public transport projects will reassure the House of the commitment of the Minister and the Government to invest in Dublin's transport infrastructure.  I know from my time in Government that there are many suitable projects on the drawing board.  However, it will require commitment, determination and vision on the Minister's part to deliver these projects to Dublin.  It will not happen under a Minister and a Government who are lamentably intent on placing the consideration of political expediency ahead of sound, sensible, realistic transport initiatives for our capital city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first correct some misconceptions.  Deputy Yates said there was a secret meeting between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself on 2 January.  That meeting was attended by the Taoiseach, public officials and myself and it was not secret, it was in the Taoiseach's diary, arranged through his private office and civil servants were present.  The purpose of the meeting, which I had sought, was to alert the Taoiseach that, whatever option was chosen, I did not want the £114 million to be lost to Ireland, so I flagged that in advance.  We also spoke about other matters, some of a festive nature.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's remarks about quality bus corridors and hope that those in public office in Dublin city and county encourage people to bring those proposals forward.  I received notifications of the various objections; people have a right to object but the matter has gone on for a long time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell said their plan could be implemented immediately but it could not because the inspector had not held a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was because the Minister cancelled it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot have an implementation policy without a public inquiry.  She said I was spitting in someone's face but I have never done that.  She asked what section could be <Col N="1341" /> opened now &mdash; I indicated that in my implementation timetable.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Lowry's contribution.  Any previous Minister, irrespective of the outcome of his or her period in office, is fully entitled to be heard and to get respect but his contribution was odd.  He said there was no formal Government contribution but there was, and £400 million plus was provided.  That is unlike the Ballymun decision, of which I approve but for which no money was provided.  The Deputy was not part of Cabinet when that decision was taken but Deputy Yates would have been, unless he was in Brussels which is quite possible.  That was an eight year scheme but no Government money was provided. It was the most amazing decision I ever saw.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry also said there was an element of capitulation.  I have neither land, property nor money, as I indicated in the register of Members' interests; nor do I wish them, nor am I envious of anyone who has them.  I am glad my life is uncluttered and unencumbered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, each of us has one line in the register.  As to the idea that I would succumb to pressure, I am interested in commerciality purely because I am a consumer.  I cannot be more emphatic in rejecting the idea that I had any kind of vested interest because that is outrageous and ridiculous.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the decision which the Government has taken to reenergise the Dublin light rail project, in line with its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The Government took a clear decision on the development of Dublin's transportation system which future generations, if not today's Opposition, will recognise as far-sighted. The light rail project has been the subject of a difficult and sometimes contentious debate.  We now need to focus all our energies and considerable skills on delivering the light rail network to the citizens of Dublin without delay.  We need a sense of common purpose to find solutions to problems.  It is easy to criticise, but the real challenge is to channel that critical energy into solving problems.</P>
      <P>I welcome the widespread support the Government's plan has received and in particular the call to action by those few who may not fully agree with it.  I detect a public mood, evident tonight, which says: &ldquo;Enough talk, let us get on with the project&rdquo;.  I responded to that mood by meeting the CIE light rail project team last Friday morning to emphasise the Government's determination to see the project implemented as quickly as possible.  We discussed the most appropriate strategy for progressing the project and I will deal with this in more detail later.  Contrary to what was said, there were no disconsolate people on Mr. Mangan's project team &mdash; they were keen to start work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> Before dealing with the strategy I will set out the background to last week's Government decision.  The Programme for Government contained a commitment to an independent study of the option of putting the light rail system underground in the city centre.  Immediately I came to office &mdash; at the second Cabinet meeting &mdash; I obtained Government approval to go ahead with that study, which was conducted by W S Atkins. The report is a valuable and important piece of work and its detailed analysis deserves to be carefully read.  It sets out the facts in a clear and unambiguous way.  It deals with the issues which have for some time concerned Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and a range of commentators.  These include matters such as disruption during construction, the long-term passenger capacity of the system and the impact of light rail operations on the traffic system generally.</P>
    <P>When I came to office I was determined to get the facts.  Up to then there had been a series of claims and counter-claims about the impact of the light rail project and I wanted an objective report from independent consultants.  No matter how many years I spend in public life I will never apologise for seeking advice, or for asking questions and challenging a system which tells me what I must do.</P>
    <P>The Government gave long and serious consideration to the Atkins report before making its decision.  Ministers heard a presentation from the consultants, and the Cabinet debated the issue on two separate occasions, between which a Cabinet sub-committee met.  The Government was determined to take a decision which was in the best long-term interests of the capital city and its citizens.  I emphasise the &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; because we are deciding a transport network that will have a useful life of well over 100 years and there seems little merit in opting for a system which Atkins said would have capacity limitations within at most 25 to 30 years.  Part of the complicated solution to these constraints would have required the use of 50 metre trams on our city streets, which is about the length of O'Connell Bridge. Until Atkins reported I had heard no one speak about trams of this length snaking through our streets as part of a vision for Dublin.</P>
    <P>On 5 May the Government decided to proceed with a light rail network comprising a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station based on the CIE preferred surface alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street, and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport, using the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused railway alignments and with an underground section in the city centre.  While the late Todd Andrews will be remembered for the many useful things he did, I am reopening Harcourt Street station.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's objective to proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght to city centre and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.  This is subject to the relevant statutory procedures and to the necessary detailed technical confirmation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> I emphasise that the Government decision takes full account of the invaluable work done to date by the CIE light rail project team in designing surface lines from Tallaght and from Sandyford to the city centre.  I commend the professionalism and dedication of the project team.  The bulk of its detailed work to date is encompassed by the Government decision.</P>
    <P>The Atkins report convinced the Government of the merit of proceeding with a substantially surface-based light rail system.  Atkins pointed to capacity difficulties ahead and suggested possible alternative ways of addressing these difficulties which would ensure the system was adequate for about the next 30 years.  The Government took a longer-term view.  Nevertheless, in revitalising and extending the overall project it will only be necessary to make significant changes to less than 1.5 kilometres of the 25 kilometres already designed by the CIE team on the Tallaght and Sandyford lines.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to engage in tautology, what we are about to embark upon, except for the tunnel section, are the same alignments, as identified and approved by the previous Government, and added to by the Ballymun to Dublin Airport to city centre to Connolly Station link and a link to Busáras.  The idea that everything is being thrown out is incorrect.  We will then have direct lines from Heuston Station to Connolly Station to Busáras overground and from Sandyford to city centre to Ballymun to Dublin Airport and a renewal of the disused alignments at Harcourt Street and Broadstone.</P>
    <P>The two lines approved by Government should be seen as part of a longer-term vision for the development of an extended light rail network for the city serving destinations such as Swords, docklands, Cabinteely and Clondalkin.  This extended network is consistent with the DTI strategy and the expanded network considered in the Atkins study.  While the Government took no formal decision on Swords, docklands, Cabinteely and Clondalkin, it was most anxious to ensure that its decision on the two lines would facilitate the longer-term development of the network on these broad lines.  The CIE project team will look at the technical feasibility of serving Finglas as part of the line from Broadstone to Ballymun and Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>While the Government is committed to speedy implementation of the project, it is anxious to ensure that the project is handled in a way which avoids technical or legal pitfalls.  When I met the CIE light rail project team on Friday last, it gave me its initial assessment of the most appropriate strategy for programming all the individual elements of the project into an overall comprehensive implementation plan.  That is attached at the back of the Luas indicative timetable.</P>
    <P>Having taken legal advice, the project team was of the view that the speediest way forward would be to withdraw the existing applications for light railway orders and to quickly submit fresh applications <Col N="1344" /> which take account of the revised situation arising from the Government decision.  This suggested approach is subject to the approval of the CIE board.  It would bring the present inquiry to an end and require the convening of a new inquiry following receipt of the fresh applications.</P>
    <P>The project team's assessment is that it should be possible to submit a fresh application for a light railway order for the Tallaght to Abbey Street section during the summer of this year. The applications for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green and the Abbey Street to Connolly Station sections would follow on afterwards.</P>

      <P>North County Dublin said no to Deputy Stagg.</P>
      <P>The detailed technical evaluation of the underground section will go ahead in parallel with the work on Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.  CIE will shortly go to tender to recruit consultants to undertake this work.  Work is already under way on the selection of possible surface route alignments for the line from Broadstone to Ballymun and Dublin Airport.  The project team hope to be able to bring that work to a stage which will permit public consultation on possible route options in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I have circulated with the text of my speech a tabular statement setting out an indicative timetable for the various elements of the project to which I have already referred.  Members will understand the target dates are subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary statutory procedures and to the necessary technical evaluations.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what I have said that a programme is being put in place which will enable progress to be made in parallel on the different elements of the project.  It should be possible also to begin construction of a light rail system in Dublin early in 2000, provided there are no legal problems on the lines which had been agreed by the previous Government.  Neither Deputies opposite nor I have control over legal difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the underground section in the city centre will run from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.  It is designed to address two important issues raised in the Atkins report. These are disruption during construction and potential longer-term capacity constraints in the central area as the network is extended.</P>
      <P>The Atkins report sets out a vivid picture of the scale of disruption which would occur on many of the capital city's principal streets.  It made it clear that the impact of building the surface system in the city centre was likely to be significantly more severe than for the underground alternative.</P>
      <P>Construction of the surface option would take place within the city centre at various times and at various locations over a period of some two years.  The Atkins report acknowledged that construction of the underground option would also have significant environmental impact.  However, it made the point that the overall impact would be limited to a small number of specific locations compared with the significant construction disruption along the full length of the on-street section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report highlighted the substantial disadvantages in terms of reduced accessibility to properties and inconvenience to bus movements and pedestrians likely to be unavoidable during the construction of the surface option.  The <Col N="1346" /> Government was particularly concerned about the potential impact of this disruption on Lower O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, College Green, Nassau Street and Dawson Street.</P>
    <P>The Atkins report also identified the potential for capacity problems as the network expanded, particularly on that part of the route which is now going overground. While Atkins suggested options such as longer vehicles &mdash; the 50 metre ones to which I referred &mdash; and a loop line through the docklands to provide some relief, the Government decided to take the long-term view.  What we build now will serve the city for many generations to come.  The Government, therefore, decided to address the capacity problem by building a tunnel under the city centre section.  This is a much more sensible approach than attempting an increasingly complex patchwork of solutions along the way as traffic grows.</P>
    <P>The first phase network now proposed also provides for much greater integration with the rest of the public transport system.  Heuston and Connolly stations will be directly linked by a light rail line; there will be direct interchange between light rail and the DART and suburban rail systems at Connolly Station; there will be a link to provincial bus services at Busaras; the airport will be directly served by the light rail network and will also have much improved links with the mainline and suburban rail systems; and both the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused rail alignments are being brought back into service as part of a revitalised public transport network. This is in line with the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  I listened with interest to the comments made by the city manager the day after the Government decision was announced.  He appeared to be comfortable with it.  I never met him.</P>

      <P>While light rail will make a vital contribution within the corridors which it serves, the Atkins report makes it clear that light rail on its own will not solve Dublin's traffic problems.  The stark figure of a 1 per cent transfer from car to public transport across the city's transport network, which has been much quoted, makes that point very well.  In this regard, I agree with those who spoke about the need for better and more Dublin buses.  I also agree with better and more DART services and carriages.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell and others previously intimated that Luas would solve all our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  A comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing Dublin's transport problem is essential.  In this regard, the Government took particular account of the Atkins view that traffic management had to be addressed whatever light rail option was chosen, either surface or underground.  At the same Cabinet meeting the Minister for the Environment and Local Government obtained funding for the Macken Street Bridge, the Cork Street-Coombe relief route and a minor scheme at Mercer Street amounting to £30 million.  This was also itemised and included in the Government decision.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office is also nearing the completion of an action plan designed to address the growing transportation deficit arising from the unprecedented level of traffic growth over the past two years.  The plan will propose short-term measures which can be taken over the next two years to deal with the problems.  It will be presented to us at the end of May.</P>
      <P>When deciding the development of the light rail network for Dublin, which I have already outlined, the Government noted that the cost had been estimated in excess of £400 million.  That is written into the Government decision.  As is proper, the Opposition constantly seeks money for various projects.  I did this when I was in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party has an amendment to the motion.  There is a lot of detailed technical work to be carried out.  This will lead to a firm cost estimate.  I see no point in getting into a debate on figures until that work is done.  It would serve no useful purpose until we have detailed information.  The Government decision was emphatic about the scope and extent of the project.  There is no doubt about what the Government wants to see implemented and funding will be provided to give effect to that decision.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided a firm policy direction for the project, based on careful consideration of the objective information in the Atkins report.  It has cleared the way to get on with implementation of a much enhanced and more sensible project.  This is the essence of good Government.  I assure the House that appropriate funding arrangements will be put in place to deliver on its commitment to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a Japanese financial input was raised in a newspaper.  It does not arise as they <Col N="1348" /> never made any application to my Department. However, the possibility of private financing for infrastructure projects is being addressed by the Department of Finance.  I expect that the approach to this general issue will be considered by the Government in the near future.  It would, therefore, be prudent to await the outcome of Government deliberations on general policy before taking any decision on the scope for private financing of the light rail project.</P>
    <P>I have always made it clear that the EU funding would not be the determining factor in making a decision on Luas.  My primary concern has been to ensure that Ireland does not lose the EU funding involved.  That objective will now be achieved through the timely transfer of this money to other suitable projects.  This is the most sensible course of action, given that the draw-down of EU funding is dependent on two crucial deadlines &mdash; contractual commitments have to be entered by the end of 1999 and eligible expenditure has to be incurred by the end of 2000.  Since the light rail project still has to go through the statutory approval process and potential subsequent legal challenges, over which nobody in this House will have any control, I judged the risk to be too high.  That was the purpose of my socalled secret meeting on 2 January, which was attended by public officials.  It is in the overall national interest that the EU funding be used elsewhere, rather than potentially irretrievably lost because of any delay in the legal process for the project, which is outside the Government's control.</P>
    <P>The community support framework monitoring committee has responsibility for making decisions on the reallocation of Structural Fund assistance decommitted from the light rail project and will consider the matter at its June meeting.  In this regard, I acknowledge the amendment put down by the Labour Party.  One would think I had the £114 million in a glass jar in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from all parties have sought this money.  Rural Deputies from the Fine Gael Party and my party have sought it for rural networks while Dublin Deputies have sought it for city-wide projects and public transport.  It is for the Minister for Finance, in conjunction with other Departments and the monitoring committee, to decide.  However, I am working hard to ensure that a reasonable proportion of these funds are used to address public transport requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Atkins report highlighted a number of areas where investment is needed in transport infrastructure in Dublin.  I also have had no shortage of advice on projects which could benefit from EU aid.  My Department has been working with CIE to identify suitable projects on Dublin suburban rail, including the DART and the Maynooth line, and on the mainline rail network. <Col N="1349" /> The light rail project, as decided by Government on 5 May, will also be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion Funding.  It addresses a number of the Commission's particular areas of interest.  It serves Ballymun, something which has been of continuing interest to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.  It also serves Dublin Airport, to which her officials are very committed.  They are also committed to improved integration of the public transport network.</P>
    <P>The Government decision has cleared the way to get on with the project.  It has dealt with the major issues of capacity and disruption, which had been bedevilling it for some years.  I ask Members to support the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion proposed by the Fine Gael Party. The Labour Party supports the motion and has proposed an amendment which I hope will be accepted by the House.</P>
      <P>There is a transport crisis strangling Dublin city which needs an urgent, comprehensive and realistic response.  The city is paying an enormous price in economic, environmental and social terms for this chaos to which solutions must be found which politicians must have the courage to implement.  The Government has failed to do this. Its decision last Tuesday represents one of its greatest derelictions of duty since it attained office.  It has decided to jettison the comprehensive on-street proposal initiated by the Dublin Transportation Initiative and supported by every Government up to the current Administration. What it has proposed in its place is a wish list of aspirations with no budget, timetable or basis in reality.  It has single-handedly halted progress on relieving Dublin's chronic traffic problem and brought the light rail project back to the drawing board for another five years at least.</P>
      <P>The concept of light rail has been central to proposals for public transport in Dublin for the past two decades.  It was recommended by the DTI as a core element of its integrated transport plan for Dublin.  It conducted the most wide-ranging and detailed examination of the transport needs of the city.  Its final report received all-party support and has formed the basis of the city's transport planning since.  It recommended an on-street light rail system for Dublin.  This conclusion was backed by the Labour Party.  In Government we insisted that planning for the project commence.  We also insisted that finance should be provided to fund it.  This approach was agreed to by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when in Government with the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile outlining the extent of the DTI light rail proposal as an impression has been created in the public mind that it was confined to two routes and did not extend to the north side. Nothing could be further from the truth.  It involved constructing a core light rail system in Dublin with three routes &mdash; Tallaght, Dundrum <Col N="1350" /> and Ballymun &mdash; which would form the first phase, to be followed by extensions to Clondalkin, Finglas, Dublin Airport and Swords.  It is as extensive as that proposed by the Minister last Tuesday.  The difference between them is that the DTI proposal was costed and had a timetable for implementation.  The Minister's proposal has neither.  She appeared to think that the absence of detail was a virtue.  I am sure her colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will have words to say on that.</P>
    <P>The DTI Luas proposal was planned in detail and fully costed.  To ensure the available £114 million in EU funding was drawn down the project had to be divided into different phases.  Phase one included the construction of the Tallaght and Dundrum lines at a cost £263 million.  Planning for the Ballymun line continued apace.  EU funding for phase one was dependent on a Government commitment to proceed with the Ballymun line.  This commitment was readily given by the previous Government.  The project was to be complemented by other proposals from the DTI such as traffic management measures, quality bus corridors, cycle-ways and park and ride facilities.</P>
    <P>The proposal found favour with all traffic experts and consultants who have examined the matter and was supported by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil when in Government with the Labour Party.  Fianna Fáil, however, has had a change of heart.  With the Progressive Democrats, it insisted on reviving the underground option.  The Minister's first action on taking office was to halt all progress on the light rail system and to commission the W S Atkins report at a cost to the taxpayer of £200,000.  The public inquiry into the DTI Luas proposal had to be adjourned to accommodate this review.</P>
    <P>The light rail project was delayed by eight months while W S Atkins compiled its report.  In common with all previous experts, it has come down on the side of the original Luas proposal backed by the Labour Party.  During the eight months it took to compile the report the Minister repeatedly reassured the Dáil that she would accept and implement the recommendations of W. S. Atkins.  On 12 November she stated, &ldquo;Regardless of the outcome of the consultancy study, we will engage in the project recommended by it&rdquo;.  On 16 December she said, &ldquo;I have made it as plain as I can, if the study concludes in favour of the overground option, tight as the timetable may be, the money earmarked for Luas will go to Luas&rdquo;.  In an Adjournment debate on the matter on 13 December she stated, &ldquo;Whatever is the result of that [the independent consultants' report] I will go at it hell for leather and it will be implemented&rdquo;.  We now have the Atkins report and we can see how hollow the Minister's words ring.  The report states at page 68: &ldquo;The recommendation of this study is that the surface option is the most appropriate and cost-effective in meeting the transport needs of the city and providing capacity to meet long-term passenger <Col N="1351" /> demands&rdquo;.  The Minister must explain why she has failed to honour her word.</P>
    <P>After a week-long Cabinet wrangle the Minister finally managed to present her own light rail proposal.  This plan has not been costed.  Nobody knows how much her pipedream will cost the tax-payer.  There will be no detailed plan of the underground route until an extensive geological examination of underground conditions has been completed.  This will probably involve the drilling of up to 100 boreholes which will plunge Dublin city into further traffic chaos.  Added to this, we have no start date for the project, no idea of how long construction will take and no notion of when, if at all, the first passengers will be carried on light rail in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of the words she spoke in the House about her own principles regarding the light rail proposal.  She said, &ldquo;I will do it with knowledge based on certainty, I will not do it based on half truths and studies which do not exist.  I want truth and knowledge&rdquo;.  If the wish list presented last Tuesday is not based on half truths and studies which do not exist, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>It took five years to complete the planning process for the original Luas proposal.  Do we now have to go back to the drawing board for another half decade before work can start?  The answer is probably yes.  That is why I object so strongly to this new unplanned, uncosted and unfinanced wish list.  If this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats pipedream is to proceed, it will be another ten years before it is completed and the first passengers travel on the system.  In the meantime the rate of car ownership will continue to grow, congestion in the city will worsen and the cost of this mayhem in economic, environmental and social terms will continue to rocket.  Dublin cannot afford this delay.  The traffic crisis needs immediate and effective action.  It does not require a project cobbled together out of political cowardice that will take a decade to complete, if it ever proceeds beyond planning stage.</P>
    <P>The Government caved in to vested interests in reaching its decision last Tuesday.  However, it by no means satisfied all the business interests in the city.  The Dublin City Centre Business Association issued a statement after the Government's decision was announced which said:</P>
    <P>Dublin City Centre Business Association deplores the Government's failure to adopt the Atkins report recommendation that on street Luas will cost less to build and operate, carry more passengers in off peak and attract 50 per cent more passengers than the alternative proposal.  Minister O'Rourke's proposed extensions are not new.  They were included in the DTI final report of 1994 which the Government then accepted.</P>
    <P>Minister O'Rourke's specific underground city centre section does not indicate a proven route, the portals at both ends, the number of city centre stops, a timetable, costs based and <Col N="1352" /> bore hole tests or whether surface Luas units comply with the underground technical requirements.  Jam in the millennium is not a solution to Dublin's traffic management needs of today let alone 1999.</P>
    <P>However, now that the Government has decided on this irrational course what will become of the £114 million of EU funding earmarked for the project?  By ditching the on street Luas proposal, the Minister and the Government have turned their backs on a fundamental element of the DTI proposals.  Given the continued mayhem the Government decision will foist on the people of Dublin, it is imperative that the £114 million is ringfenced and spent on implementing other aspects of the DTI proposals for Dublin, for example, quality bus corridors and cycle routes. Dublin is the only city in Europe with a publicly owned public transport system which does not receive a subsidy.  As a result, it cannot provide the buses to carry passengers or develop new routes.  The company has been given a commercial mandate to carry out a social service and the two do not mix.</P>
    <P>The £114 million should be used for environmental traffic cells in the centre of Dublin, enhanced traffic calming measures in the suburbs, investment in new rolling stock and infrastructure on suburban and DART lines to adequately accommodate passenger demand, investment in the bus fleet for Dublin Bus and immediate construction of the Tallaght-city centre and Sandy-ford-city centre on street lines.  All these should be implemented through the ringfencing of the £114 million that is now available.  Members should take note of the point made by Deputy Lowry that the EU has warned the Department and the Minister that the £20 million already spent on the original Luas proposal must be refunded.  Consideration must be given to this aspect in adding up the total cost.  Perhaps that is part of the plus to which the Minister for Public Enterprise referred.</P>
    <P>Action on the light rail system should also continue while studies on the underground section of the Minister's route are carried out.  To salvage some credibility the Government must proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght-Connolly Station line, the Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green line and, when the relevant procedures are complete, the Ballymun-Broadstone line.  I welcome the Minister's statement that she proposes to get these elements of the project moving while waiting for the studies on the underground section.  The geological and engineering studies required for the proposed underground element should proceed while this work is being carried out on the Tallaght-Connolly Station, Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green and Ballymun-Broad-stone lines.  We cannot allow the entire light rail project to be deferred so the pet project of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is investigated.</P>
    <P>The engineering difficulties in constructing the short tunnel proposed by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, are immense.  The Minister's plan <Col N="1353" /> involves tunnelling from the relative height of Harcourt Street to a depth of 100 metres under the city before emerging at Broadstone.  I have received professional advice that such a short tunnel to such a depth will have a roller coaster effect on any train using the system and poses serious implications in terms of comfort and safety.  The chamber is approximately five metres in height.  However, the tunnel must go to a depth of 100 metres to cross under the river Liffey and trains will encounter a rapid decline.  They will need special braking systems which will cause environmental problems in the tunnel.  They will also need special engines to take them out of the tunnel at the other side.  It will have serious effects on the comfort and safety of passengers.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Atkins report specifically outlined that the underground option would not serve the needs of people with disabilities.  Much lip service is paid in the House to transport for people with disabilities.  The Atkins report specifically stated that the underground section would be unsuitable for people with disabilities.  The Minister's proposals when they finally emerge must include measures that seek to rectify this serious problem.</P>
    <P>If, as I expect, the tunnel is shown to be the financial, technical and social nightmare predicted, the on street connections can proceed and we can at last have an integrated light rail system for the capital.  If the Minister proceeds with the lines as previously planned to Ballymun, Tallaght and Sandyford as far as the mouth of the proposed tunnel, by the time they are built I am confident it will have been shown that the tunnel is not a viable proposal.  We then will have saved something because the other tracks will be in place and can be connected on surface.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the underground option proposed by the Minister will not be taken up.  I am also convinced that the Government decided to scuttle the light rail project and replace it with a wish list of pious aspirations that it has no intention of putting into practice.  I am further convinced that, following the strong reaction of the public and the Opposition, the Government has been forced to effectively reverse its decision and start building the light rail system on street as originally planned.</P>

The Minister realises that the tunnel is a non-starter.  If the rest of the construction commences, we will get something from it in the long run.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey): Before the adjournment of the debate, I referred to an amendment to the Bill which I wish to table on Committee Stage.  It is concerned with a gratuity scheme for local councillors.  I envisage that this would operate for a defined period in 1998 from a date subsequent to the enactment of the Bill and to a specified date before the end of the year. In the period concerned, it would be open to any councillor with at least five years' qualifying service by the date of the local elections in June 1999 to apply for the gratuity.  Local authorities would issue eligible applicants with written notification of their eligibility for a gratuity which would be payable to former members following the June 1999 elections, save in the case of those applicants who, notwithstanding receipt of notification of eligibility, stand for election.  This means that, although a person may have been told they are <Col N="1355" /> eligible for a gratuity, they will not receive one if they stand for election.  Persons in receipt of a gratuity who become local authority members subsequent to June 1999, for example, if they are co-opted a year or 18 months later, will have to refund the gratuity.</P>
    <P>There are two purposes to the gratuity.  First, it gives modest recognition to the sterling service many councillors have given on a voluntary basis over many years.  The system of local government is being renewed and I hope to introduce a local government Bill containing many reforms so that a new system of local government will be in place from the June 1999 elections.  Those who have served many years under the current system should have that recognised if they are bowing out.  The second purpose of the gratuity is to make it possible, as councillors retire in advance of the next local elections, to open the door for a wider spectrum of candidates to enter local government.  I hope this measure will address some of the imbalances which already exist and that it will encourage young people and women to contest the next local elections and to participate more fully in local government which needs fresh blood and a new impetus.  In saying that, I do not wish to denigrate the service given by long-serving councillors.  Some of them will want to continue serving and, if they so choose, there is no doubt their experience will be invaluable in the new system.</P>
    <P>I believe this measure as well as other initiatives, such as the introduction of the SPCs, will contribute to a renewed and reinvigorated local government system.  It will make it more responsive, flexible and relevant to modern needs.  I know the general outline of the gratuity system is welcomed by Members and that local authority members welcome the recognition it affords.  The system will operate on a once-off basis and will apply to those who retire before the next election. I do not intend it to continue.  I hope to have in place through the medium of the next local government reform Bill measures which will make it unnecessary to repeat the exercise of paying a gratuity following future elections.</P>
    <P>Criticisms were levelled at the change in the funding of local government and the lack of discretion on the part of local authorities which Opposition Deputies alleged was contained in the Bill.  Deputy De Rossa spoke of the loss of local discretion and local accountability which will arise from the termination of the local authorities' powers to vary the rates of motor taxation locally.  Those comments are the product of politicking.  The proposed local variation power would have offered no discretion to local authorities.  Cynics would have said it was no more than a sop to local democracy, discretion and accountability.  The 6 per cent increase in motor tax for the average car would have amounted to an increase of £10 per annum on the average car of 1,200 cubic centimetres.  Surely no one in the House would claim that empowerment of local <Col N="1356" /> authorities to levy such an amount would promote local discretion or local accountability. Given the inadequate base of the existing funding system, just about all local authorities would have levied the 6 per cent, if not in the first year then over the two years.  That would have amounted to a potential £18 million for all local authorities which represents less than 1 per cent of total local authority expenditure.  That is hardly local discretion.</P>
    <P>The other point about the 6 per cent increase which Deputy De Rossa did not seem to know, although he was a member of the Government which introduced it, was that once it was implemented, no further increases could be imposed.  No Deputy would regard that as local discretion.  Furthermore, the decision as to whether there would be a local variation rested with the local authority which collected motor tax.  This meant urban district councils and borough councils, which do not have a motor tax facility, would not have that power and that it rested instead with county councils.</P>
    <P>Another issue referred to as interfering with the discretion of local authorities was the capping of commercial rates.  Deputies Dukes, Wall and De Rossa charged me with undermining local autonomy by proposing to cap commercial rates. I believe local authorities in general behaved responsibly when they had the power to levy rates without the cap and I acknowledge that. However, there is little doubt that the commercial sector has borne the brunt of deficiencies in the overall funding system with which local authorities have had to live over the past two decades. Local authorities, which were starved of resources and which had increased responsibilities and functions placed upon them by central Government, had little option but to increase rates at levels greater than inflation.  My proposals are intended to strike a balance between the financial needs of local authorities while ensuring that rates increases do not affect the competitive position of the commercial sector.  I am considering the different options on capping rates and will announce the specific capping proposals in plenty of time for those local authorities preparing their 1999 estimates.</P>
    <P>The cap on rates must be seen as part of an overall package of funding which the Bill will deliver.  That overall package will substantially enhance, not detract, from the autonomy and discretion of local authorities by putting greater resources at their disposal.  The fundamental point here is that discretion without resources is a contradiction in terms.  It is a paradox and I will not perpetuate the system by telling local authorities that they have widespread discretion.  We could tell them in the morning to do anything they like but if they have no funds nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>I would be more taken with Opposition arguments for the necessity of local discretion and financing if the same Deputies had not taken away the power of local authorities to raise <Col N="1357" /> approximately £60 million per year when water charges were removed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> Several Deputies mentioned equalisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes suggested for the second time that the previous Government had come to some form of agreement with local authorities on equalisation.  The Deputy might enlighten me and others in the Department as to where this agreement is. Perhaps he will make that information available to us under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know who briefed the Deputy on this matter, but I corrected him before about it.  He has repeated his suggestion, but there is no such agreement.  The equalisation issue was left hanging by the previous Government which did nothing to address the fair redistribution of funding to local authorities.  If Deputy Dukes can prove me wrong I would be delighted.  Deputies who have debated this matter will know that we are trying to work towards a scientifically based method of equalisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's contribution suggested that we are throwing equalisation out.  We are committed to real equalisation, and this year we introduced a limited form of equalisation on a scientific basis.  Local authorities were given points based on a number of factors and money from the motor tax fund &mdash; which will become the local government fund &mdash; was distributed to all local authorities.  Those with particular needs under this points system got more money.  It was imperfect, perhaps, but it was the first attempt by any Government to make money available to local government on a scientific basis.  It shows that we are committed to equalisation.  The provisions in this Bill largely echo the previous Bill on the issue of an equalisation council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes seems to have great difficulty with the scientific approach, but in the long-term, we intend disbursing the money on the basis of a needs and resources study which is currently focusing on Galway County Council, Galway Corporation and Ballinasloe UDC.  We are trying to draft a model that can be applied to all local authorities, and when that model is in place every local authority will be examined in reference to the study criteria.  Local government will be funded on that basis.  I have given a commitment that no local authority will get less money than the 1998 base.  That base will apply so it will benefit all local authorities.  It will not be done on the whim of any particular Minister but on a scientific basis.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and Wall expressed concern about section 11 of the Bill, while Deputy Olivia Mitchell welcomed it.  That is due to her knowledge of local government.  The purpose of this section, as Deputy Mitchell rightly highlighted, is to remove the absolute statutory requirement that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the Local Appointments Commission.  This provision will put posts requiring professional qualification on the same level with all other administrative posts.  The Minister of the day can declare the level at which the LAC can fill the post directly.  I intend to have the LAC <Col N="1359" /> continue to fill all senior technical and administrative posts in the local authority services.  As evidenced by some of the information I got, some fears were expressed or stirred up that this will not continue to be the position.  Such fears are unfounded.</P>
    <P>I propose this limited change in the recruitment mechanism for three reasons.  First, there is a glaring need to enable LAC operations and interviews to be streamlined.  By freeing up resources currently devoted to filling a myriad of lower and middle technical professional posts we will be able to speed up the LAC process in general. Second, the LAC and others admitted that the LAC has great difficulty in coping with the volume of recruitment demands, particularly for assistant and executive engineers, with the result that posts remain vacant at local level for far too long.  It is essential for the efficient operation of local services that posts should be filled without delay when vacancies arise.  Recruitment at local level in those areas is the fastest and most efficient way of doing that.  Third, there is a statutory requirement that all posts requiring professional qualification must be filled by the LAC. This has meant a significant number of engineers and other professionals are employed on a long-term temporary basis by local authorities.  Many have been temporary for years.  Such is the length of service of many of them that there is a strong case in equity for some way to be found to allow them become permanent employees.  This amendment would remove the statutory barrier and pave the way to provide the flexibility to allow their position to be regularised.  Some people have been lobbied about this and may have got a steer on it for whatever reason.  I will not delay the House by going into the detail of this, but I will let Opposition spokespersons have a detailed note explaining the issues involved and giving them a greater understanding of it.  I am anxious to facilitate those who have been in temporary posts for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined why we are postponing the local government elections from 1998 to 1999 and I will not elaborate on that.  I reiterate there is a major programme of local government renewal under way.  It involves trying to get new people to take up local government membership, a review of electoral areas and the establishment of SPCs.  It is fair the shape of a revised and improved local government system should be known to people before they are asked to cast a vote.  It is also fair that those who intend to try to become members of local authorities should know what will be the shape of the local government system.  If people are informed about the system we intend to operate, which they will be by way of this Bill and a further Bill we hope to introduce before the end of this year, it will attract some people to contest local elections.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the need to ensure we get value for money from local authorities.  Some thought this was not adverted to <Col N="1360" /> in the Bill.  It is not directly adverted to but I have visited practically every local authority since I came into office and every time I spoke about the new funding system for local government I spoke about value for money.  It is the cornerstone of the policy I want to pursue and I intend to do so vigorously with local authorities.  Some Member said I was paternalistic about value for money and that the electorate should decide if people are getting value for money.  The electorate will decide, but I have an obligation, as would any other person in my office in the Custom House, to ensure the tax-payer, who will henceforth fund the local government system, gets value for money and that local authorities operate in an efficient, effective and economic manner.  I make no apologies for trying to ensure that is brought about.  If that is not done there is a waste of money at local authority level which brings the democratic system and politicians into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I intend value for money will be top of the agenda.  Work is ongoing in the Department in this area.  I am developing a range of performance indicators on value for money studies by the VFM unit in the Department and by VFM audits of local authorities by local government auditors. We will have a consultancy in place shortly to advance the area of performance indicators. Local authority members who complained in the past about not knowing whether the system was working effectively or efficiently will be reassured by these indicators.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by a Deputy that local authority members will be anxious to ensure that every pound available to a local authority is wisely spent.  At present they can only take the word of the people spending the money, but it is important to have objective standards and performance indicators.  We intend to ensure they are in place.  It is also important that we should be able to compare the performance of one local authority with that of another.  That will not be done to denigrate any local authority, but best practice should be identified and local authorities should learn from each other and provide value for money for taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Perry's point on the rating and valuation system.  The rate system, which is the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance, is under review.  It is intended to introduce a valuation Bill this year and some of the points raised by the Deputy will be taken up in the review.  I look forward to the Bill's publication.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall complained about the centralisation of the local government fund.  To back up his argument he quoted from section 3.  Section 3(2) states the Minister shall manage and control the fund and the fund shall consist of such accounts as the Minister may determine.  Section 3(4) states the said accounts shall be in such form and be prepared in such manner as the Minister may determine.  Deputy Wall used that section to suggest I wanted to hog all the money and distribute <Col N="1361" /> it at my discretion or whim.  That is not the way I operate and I hope it is not the way any of my successors will operate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned equalisation and how we will try to ensure, on an objective basis, that local authorities get a reasonable amount.  The wording in that section is a direct restatement of the provisions of Section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, which my predecessor and Deputy Wall's colleague, Deputy Howlin, guided through the Oireachtas.  The local government fund which I propose is no more centralised than the equalisation fund which Deputy Howlin put in place.  Deputy Wall can claim he was not a Member of this House when that Bill was passed, but he was a Member of the other House.</P>
    <P>The funds from the local government fund will be distributed to local authorities on the basis of needs and resources.  It is valid to state that there should be that discretion and an objective dispersal of the funds as far as possible, which we are endeavouring to do.  We will not get this right on the first shot but as we achieve a more scientific basis, we will get it right eventually.  If it was easy to get it right the first time, over the past 20 years, some Government would have tried to put proper equalisation in place.  If people have suggestions on equalisation and how it might work, I will be delighted to listen to them.</P>
    <P>This debate started with promises made in our programme for Government.  Since taking office I have had extensive consultations with local authority staff, elected members, LAMA, the AIMI, the GCCC, the chambers of commerce, management, engineers and with Members of the Opposition through the committee of the House.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill did not appear over-night.  We carefully crafted them to ensure that local authorities will have the resources to face the problems of the next millennium.  It will give local authorities extra space and £125 million more than they had in 1997.  It will be good for local government.  However, it is only a beginning.  Other reforms need to take place.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  It has been about empowerment, local democracy and communities.  It is about making local government more responsive, more representative and better resourced to work for and with local communities.  Local government can only benefit from the provisions of the Bill.  I ask Deputies for their support in facilitating it through both Houses.  The Bill will improve local government and I will try to ensure that in the next few years there will be further improvement.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to open the discussion on the report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the Amsterdam Treaty.  The joint committee drew up a work programme at the beginning of the year, which included a number of reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas, of which the report on the Amsterdam Treaty is the first.  The joint committee heard from a number of organisations in its consideration of the treaty.  Mr. Cassells and Ms O'Donovan of the ICTU addressed the joint committee on 25 February last.  The Institute of European Affairs delegation, consisting of Professor Dooge, Professor Laffan, Mr. Regan and Mr. Stewart made a presentation to the committee on 25 March.  Mr. Brennan and Ms Glennon of IBEC, Mr. Cole and Mr. O'Dowd of Peace and Neutrality Alliance, Mr. Coughlan of the National Platform and Mr. Allen of the INOU addressed the committee on 8 April.</P>
      <P>I thank all of those for their assistance to the joint committee in its deliberations and for the oral and written submissions they made.  The presentations were followed by question and answer sessions which were lively and informative.  The proceedings were enhanced by the excellent presentations and the attendance of many Irish MEPs.  The committee became aware of the diversity of views regarding the issues involved.  The written submissions are appended to the report.</P>
      <P>The deliberations of the joint committee, including the question and answer sessions are now available.  As well as the submissions appended to the report, two other publications were presented to the committee &mdash; Amsterdam: <i>What the Treaty Means</i> edited by Ben Tonra and Revolt or Revolution: <i>the Constitutional Boundaries of the European Community</i> by Dr. Diarmuid Rossa Phelan.</P>
      <P>In its conclusion, the joint committee referred to the level of publicity given to the issues involved in the referendum on the treaty at the time it was considering this question.  I am glad to say the position has improved since then.  The Referendum Commission is being distributed and there has been considerable exposure in the media.</P>
      <P>The joint committee recommends in its report the summary of the White Paper, which is available free on request from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In section 11, the summary outlines the main provisions of the treaty and deals with them in a succinct and comprehensive way.  Commentators on both sides of the fence have commended this summary.  Tá an foilsiúcháin seo le fáil as Gaeilge chomh mhaith agus molaim é daoibh agus don phobail i gcoitinne mar tugann sé pictiúir, níl amháin atá leathain go leor, ach atá cruinn chomh mhaith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever one may think about the Amsterdam Treaty, there is no doubt that it is an important <Col N="1363" /> document deserving of careful consideration by everyone.  I support the treaty wholeheartedly. Institutions will now be more accountable and more focused in terms of peoples' needs.  The commissions' literature states four main objectives; to place employment and citizens' rights at the heart of the Union; to sweep away the last remaining obstacles to freedom of movement and to strengthen security; to give Europe a stronger voice in world affairs; and to make the Union's institutional structure more efficient with a view to enlarging the Union with new member states joining.</P>
    <P>As regards the first objective, it is clear that member states, not the institutions, are still responsible for dealing with unemployment. However, the treaty places national policies as part of a co-ordinated European strategy on unemployment.  For the first time it is made clear that the European Union is now based on liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the role of law.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the elimination of the final obstacles to freedom of movement and we can only benefit from the provisions regarding combating crime.  In this context I welcome the incorporation of the Schengen arrangement into the Union's framework.  Perhaps we will be in a position to participate, with our nearest neighbour, in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The matter that has given rise to most discussion so far has been foreign and security policy.  There were heated exchanges in the joint committee on this issue.  On the basis of the political commitments given by party leaders to holding a referendum on a move from neutrality, I am satisfied the decision on this question remains in the hands of the people.  Institutionally, the European Parliament will be a more important player on the European stage as a result of the treaty. The co-decision procedure is now more or less the general rule in the legislative area.  The European Parliament will have an important endorsement role in the appointment of President of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the treaty concerning the role of national parliaments.  As parliamentarians, we are given the opportunity in the treaty to play a more important role in European affairs through the provisions regarding draft legislation and co-operation among parliamentary committees of European affairs.  It is a matter for us to take on this role.  It is up to Members of the Houses to make the running in this regard if we are to play this role effectively.</P>
    <P>I thank members of the joint committee and the members of the European Parliament who attended and contributed to meetings of the joint committee on the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I look forward to the statements of Members and particularly to the public debate on the issues involved in the referendum.  The joint committee is glad to have had the opportunity to allow various interests to make their points.  The report's value <Col N="1364" /> is in the submission appended to it as well as the debates published yesterday, which are available to the Houses and the public.  I thank the party whips for making time available for statements on the report of the joint committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes this report as further evidence of the importance which the Oireachtas places upon the Treaty of Amsterdam as the next necessary step in European integration.  Tonight's contributions are timely as the referendum campaign on the treaty is moving to its final phase.</P>
      <P>At its special meeting of 24 April last, whose report is the occasion of tonight's statements, the Joint Committee on European Affairs expressed concern at the level of publicity which has been given to the issues involved in the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I wish, therefore, to avail of this opportunity to set out the facts on the important matter of information to the public in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  My account will illustrate the action which the Government has taken in the circumstances in which it finds itself in relation to this referendum, to help to ensure that all eligible voters will be in a position to make an informed decision on the treaty in the referendum.  This action began long before the Government, on 20 April last, decided that the Amsterdam referendum would be held on 22 May.  To understand the true position, it is necessary to go back to the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the treaty of Amsterdam.  For various reasons, not least the approach taken by the previous Government to the negotiations, that Intergovernmental Conference was conducted in a notably more open fashion than previous Intergovernmental Conferences.</P>
      <P>This treaty was negotiated in a more open fashion than earlier EU treaties.  Deputies who were in Government at the time will recall that transparency was a hallmark of the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the Treaty of Amsterdam from March 1996 to June 1997. Throughout the negotiations both the European and national parliaments, including our own, were kept regularly informed of the state of play. There were regular briefings for the media.  The general outline for a draft revision of the treaties, which was drafted by the Irish Presidency and submitted to the European Council in December 1997, was clearly and succinctly written in language intended to be readily understood by interested members of the public.  Copies of this document were sent to all public libraries and to a large number of NGOs and other interested groups who had made submissions to the Department of Foreign Affairs during the negotiation of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the conclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam in June 1997 and its signature in October, the Government immediately set about the preparation of a White Paper on the Treaty <Col N="1365" /> of Amsterdam with the objective of contributing to an informed public debate about it.  A full day of statements on the treaty in Dáil Éireann on 16 October last, as well as numerous parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs throughout last autumn about, for example, the progress of work on the White Paper, served to keep a focus on the treaty throughout the period of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was launched by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26 January, is probably the most comprehensive and comprehensible account of the treaty produced anywhere in Europe.  It has been acknowledged as such by our EU partners, by applicant countries and by the EU institutions as well as within Ireland.  It is written in purely objective, factual, non-advocative terms.  Opponents as well as supporters of the treaty are agreed on this.  In addition to Irish and European parliamentarians and the press, the White Paper was sent to all public libraries and to all third level educational institutions.  The media were briefed about the treaty at the time of the launch.  The Government is pleased to note the intensified coverage which is at last being given to the subject in the press and the electronic media, now that the referendum campaign is in high gear.</P>
    <P>Just days after the publication of the White Paper, the Department of Foreign Affairs produced a Summary of the White Paper in both Irish and English language versions.  Availability of this 30-page summary, free on request, was widely advertised in the national press on 1 and 2 February, well in advance of the referendum campaign.  Since the campaign began requests from individuals and groups for copies of the summary have accelerated perceptibly.  The Government is pleased that the summary, like the White Paper, has been praised by opponents as well as supporters for its clear, balanced and succinct account of what the treaty contains.  As noted in the conclusion to its report, the joint committee recommended this summary to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the public as giving succinct but comprehensive coverage of the issues involved.  On a recent popular radio programme entirely devoted to the treaty, panellists representing both sides agreed in characterising the summary as the single best starting point for anybody who wishes to be informed about what the Treaty of Amsterdam means.  I invite Deputies to play their part in letting it be known that the summary of the Government's White Paper remains available to members of the public and that it can be obtained free on request to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place to ensure that any voter seeking to be informed about the treaty is in a position to get a copy of this very readable summary.  It has been provided in both languages to all public libraries and citizens' information centres with the indication that they may seek further copies in order to meet requests from <Col N="1366" /> members of the public.  In addition, it remains open to any member of the public to request the summary in either language directly from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made that it is difficult to obtain a copy of the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Some have even suggested that the position with respect to the availability of the treaty text is somehow sinister, but I reject this.  The text of the treaty, in English and Irish which is also a treaty language, went on sale in the Government Publications Sales Office in Molesworth Street after the treaty was signed last October.  This is standard practice.  It is exactly the practice which was followed with respect to the more ambitious Maastricht Treaty.  I assure the House, therefore, that the text of the treaty is available.  Since late October last, the Government Publications Office has at all times been in a position to meet sales demand for it.  As we move into the final stage of the referendum campaign, the treaty text is still available from the Government Publications Office.  Moreover, as already stated in this House more than once, the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam has for several months past been available on the Department of Foreign Affairs website.  I have read that at this stage it is available on the websites of most political parties, with the notable exception of the party which has sought to make an issue of its inaccessibility, and on the website of at least one broadsheet national daily newspaper.</P>
    <P>To compare unfavourably the limited availability of the Amsterdam Treaty with the dissemination of the Good Friday Agreement to every household is to overlook a fundamental difference between the two documents.  The Good Friday Agreement is an entirely new, stand-alone treaty and it is not the subject of a Government White Paper.  The Amsterdam Treaty consists entirely of amendments to earlier treaties to which the people have consented in three previous referenda.  Inevitably, it is a highly referential rather than a stand-alone document.  Since the action of the Danish Government tends to be cited in various connections in regard to this referendum, the House might note that the Danish Government sensibly decided, in view of this characteristic, not to circulate the Treaty of Amsterdam to every household.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam has been considered in this House and in the Seanad at several stages since it was concluded.  In reporting to the House on 10 July after the European Council of June 1997 at which the treaty was concluded, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a comprehensive presentation of the content of the new treaty.  Following its signature by Foreign Ministers on 2 October, all parties in this House and a number of Independent Deputies made statements on the Treaty over several hours on 16 October.  In March the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, passed all Stages in the Dáil giving rise to extensive debate at each Stage.  The Seanad's consideration of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Bill on 1 April also prompted numerous contributions from Members on the Treaty.  On these occasions the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the Government set out the Government's position on the Amsterdam Treaty and on the related amendment which it is proposed to make to the Constitution in considerable detail.  To suggest, therefore, that the Oireachtas has not paid sufficient attention to the Treaty is simply untenable.</P>
    <P>For the first time in an EU referendum campaign there is an independent statutory commission which is charged with providing information on the referendum proposal in a way that is fair to all sides.  The Referendum Commission, which is chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay, has already distributed one bilingual information booklet entitled <i>An Overview: Your Questions on the Amsterdam Treaty Referendum Answered</i> to every household in the country.  Public libraries and citizens' information centres have received copies of a fuller publication entitled <i>Your Voice, Your Choice: An insight into the Amsterdam Treaty</i> for members of the public to consult.  A second bilingual booklet setting out the cases for and against the Treaty as reflected in submissions made to the commission by proponents and opponents of the Treaty will reach households in the course of this week.  The commission is also making extensive use of the electronic media to disseminate material on the Treaty.</P>
    <P>By legislating to establish the Referendum Commission the Government has made provision for the production at public expense of material which constitutes a basis on which all voters can begin to inform themselves about the Treaty and its implications.</P>
    <P>I note from its report that the committee, of which I am not a member, received submissions from a number of bodies including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  I was struck by the fact that employment featured as a matter of common concern to these disparate bodies.  Provided the provisions of the new Title on Employment are activated and developed in a meaningful way they will make a real difference to efforts throughout Europe to combat unemployment.  At a minimum they represent a significant step forward in the co-ordination of the employment policies of member states and an essential complement to the creation of a single market with a single currency.</P>
    <P>The committee also received submissions from the Peace and Neutrality Alliance and the National Platform.  In this regard I can be brief. The Treaty explicitly states that EU policy shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.  This reference was originally inserted in the Maastricht Treaty to take account of Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  Successive Governments have made clear that if ever the issue of an EU common <Col N="1368" /> defence were to arise in the future it would be put to the people for their decision in a referendum.  An EU common defence would be such a major undertaking that it would require major Treaty reform, a further intergovernmental conference and, in Ireland's case, a referendum.</P>
    <P>Far from eroding neutrality, the inclusion in the Treaty of peacekeeping, humanitarian, crisis management and peacemaking tasks is fully in line with our long standing commitment to UN peacekeeping and is to be welcomed.  While the essentially intergovernmental nature of the CFSP will be maintained, the preparation, adoption and implementation of decisions in the foreign policy area will be improved.  This will help the EU to play a role in the future commensurate with its responsibilities on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Some opponents of the Treaty focus on very particular points in it with which they disagree. This approach leads them to argue that the State should withhold consent to the Treaty and seek to renegotiate those parts to which they object. Such arguments fail completely to understand the way in which the member states come to agreement within the EU.  It must be understood that not ratifying the Treaty would throw its entire contents into doubt.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to one example of what would be lost.  In the negotiations related to the EU's institutions Ireland remained firm on the right of each member state to nominate a full member of the Commission and this is reflected in the provisions of the Protocol which deals with institutions.  Were the Amsterdam Treaty prevented from coming into force all bets would be off.  There could be absolutely no assurance that this crucial principle would emerge intact from a second round of negotiation.  Indeed, given the dissatisfaction of a number of partners, not including Ireland, with the outcome on institutions, it would be folly to endanger what was secured at Amsterdam with respect to the composition of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In the field of social protection it has been said that the ending of the UK opt out from the Social Protocol and its integration into the Treaty is of no relevance to the Irish voter.  On the contrary, this development is highly relevant to Ireland's competitive position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the UK within the Single Market.  Competitive advantage is not just a matter of exchange rates.  By joining with the other 14 member states the UK has ended the breach on social policy which opened up at Maastricht and cleared the way for the development of a unified social policy throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>Were the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty to be blocked, no member state would be in a position at EU level to insist on the retention of those parts of the Treaty which it particularly likes and to seek to renegotiate those which it likes less.  The negotiations for the Treaty were conducted with a view to arriving at a package of measures which relate to each other and form a whole.  The Treaty was concluded as a coherent, if modest, whole.  The Government is convinced <Col N="1369" /> that all Irish interests were well served in the negotiation of this Treaty and in its outcome.  The Treaty of Amsterdam has a great many merits and no negatives for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The past century has been one of progress for the country.  We look forward with optimism to the opportunities the next millennium will bring. There are two great steps to be taken on 22 May. One is the ratification of the amendment to the Constitution to the Northern Ireland peace agreement and the other is the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  They are inextricably linked in the totality of relationships on the island and the future development of the country.  I hope the nation will ensure that a strong positive decision is made so that we may continue to give our representatives in Europe continued support in their efforts to ensure Ireland plays a positive role in Europe's future and benefits from a growing economy in the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of great concern to nurses who work in the ambulance services in the Southern Health Board area. In order to get information on this matter I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children on 6 May 1998 &mdash; Question No. 199.  The question read:</P>
      <P>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin asked the Minister for Health and Children the way in which the on-call system of work operates for workers under the remit of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows the public health system must provide a 24 hour, seven day a week service.  This requires that certain grades of employee such as hospital consultants and radiographers provide an &ldquo;on call&rdquo; service, i.e. that the employee in question is available and is liable to be called in to work outside normal working hours should the need arise.  I do not understand how the Minister can compare consultants with these nurses.  Certainly, their rates of pay do not compare.  The system works as follows: the nurses are paid 90p per hour only when waiting and are only paid adequately when they are in the ambulance on an emergency call.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will answer the following questions to clarify the matter for the House. Must a period on-call follow a period of physical duties?  Is the present system operated by the Southern Health Board as regards these nurses legal?  When does the Minister intend to implement the recommendations of the ambulance review report?  Is funding in place to implement these recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> The ambulance review report was to be implemented in 1997.  We are half way through 1998, but there is no sign of moves being made to implement same.  The nurses who work on this service are doing a magnificent job and it is disgraceful that they are not getting decent pay. While they are waiting, they get 90p per hour. There are approximately 34 personnel affected and it is a disgrace that in a time of plenty the nurses who operate one of the most essential services in the health system are being dealt with in such a manner through lack of funding.  If the ambulance service and the personnel who operate it do not deserve adequate funding, where are we going?</P>
    <P>There is also a fear in my constituency of South Kerry that the health board is considering removing the night time ambulance service in the Kenmare area.  I remind the Minister that if the Killarney ambulance service is to be expected to cover the Kenmare area in addition to its own area, the system will be in chaos.  Is the Minister aware of the huge mileage involved?  I hope he will assure the House that this proposal is only a rumour.</P>
    <P>To return to the main issue of the ambulance nurses, it is appalling that they are not being paid adequately for the time they wait to attend an emergency.  It is not their fault they must sit waiting for a call.  This is most unjust and I urge the Minister to give a firm commitment to these wonderful nurses that a solution to their predicament will be found as a matter of urgency.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that health workers who perform essential services to the community are given just reward for the work they do.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As the Deputy did not refer to any specific grade or group of workers, I can only outline the general principles underlying the provision of on-call cover in the health service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate hospitals and other health and social service providers are expected to provide services to patients and clients on a 24 hour per day seven day week basis.  The bulk of the care is provided within the normal working day and the majority of health service staff are rostered to be on duty during this period. However, provision has to be made to respond to emergencies which may arise from time to time. Emergencies may arise from a deterioration in the condition of patients already in hospital or from patients who are brought in to accident and emergency departments.  For community and personal social services, there may be a need to respond to the urgent needs of children or the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, on-call services are provided by staff members who have finished their normal day shift.  In a small number of instances a separate group of staff provide on-call services on a <Col N="1371" /> shift basis.  Staff providing on-call services may be based in the hospital or may be on-call from their homes.  Some staff, such as laboratory technicians in large hospitals, may be rostered to work for fixed sessions up to midnight to deal with emergencies and then be on-call from home for the remainder of the night.  The basis on which staff are rostered for on-call services and the arrangements for paying for these services are the subject of agreements with the relevant unions and staff associations.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the provision of these services and the payment systems are kept to under regular review.  There is a fine balance to be struck between ensuring that sufficient suitably qualified staff are available to deal with emergencies and ensuring that staff and other resources are utilised to maximum efficiency.  The responsibility for manning on-call services is a matter, in the first instance, for local health service managers who are best placed to make judgments on the extent and nature of the emergency cover required for their particular institution.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised specific questions and in order to get replies, perhaps she might table a parliamentary question or raise the matter on the Adjournment and be more specific about the ambulance service, etc.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tuam (Galway) Urban Renewal Status.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many compelling reasons Tuam should be successful in gaining urban renewal status on this occasion.  Recently, there has been extensive dialogue with local political and business interests and the plan has been made as inclusive as possible.  The new urban renewal scheme is more focused than earlier schemes.  Galway County Council must be complimented on the leadership it has shown in getting the services of consultants, Brady Shipman and Martin, to draw up the plan which serves as an application for the next phase of the national urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>Tuam has a chequered history.  It was always a thriving market town but suffered greatly in the mid-1980s when the sugar factory closed. However, in the past five or six years, there has been huge investment in water and sewerage schemes and in link roads which have transformed the town.  Side by side with this development, there has been a remarkable resurgence of spirit and confidence in the town.  Many new houses have been built, existing factories have been expanding their workforces and there are many new small industries are setting up.  It is against this background that the urban renewal plan for Tuam, which is imaginative and sensible, has been tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> There are areas in Tuam, like other towns of its size, which need rejuvenation.  Many of these areas have been included in the plan.  It has always been felt that Tuam, because of its proximity to Galway, would never be anything more than a satellite town of Galway.  However, there is every reason to believe it can attract new industry in its own right.  It is certainly attracting many people to come to live in the town.  The extension of the urban renewal scheme to areas of the town, which would be less likely to develop without incentives, would be good.  The plan is balanced and the provision of urban renewal status to Tuam could be an important phase in the development of these areas in the future.</P>
    <P>The proximity of Tuam to Galway is both a strength and a weakness.  It is a weakness in that a large number of people commute to work in Galway each morning but live in Tuam and enjoy the benefits of a highly attractive country town. There are opportunities for development in Tuam which will present themselves in the future because of the dramatic expansion of Galway city.  It is likely Tuam will feature in the promotion of industrial jobs if the infrastructure is good enough to take that type of development.  It is in this context that the urban renewal plan is extremely important to Tuam.</P>
    <P>I propose a small extension to the plan which is worthwhile, feasible and necessary.  A small area of Tuam encompassing four small business premises has been left out of the plan.  It is contiguous to an area identified as suitable for the plan but it is like a sore thumb sticking out.  Will the Minister of State ask his officials to look at what appears to be a glaring omission?</P>
    <P>This is the only urban renewal scheme in County Galway that has been earmarked for inclusion.  There is a concerted and concentrated effort by everybody concerned to ensure Tuam is included.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure this professional application on behalf of Tuam by the consultants, spearheaded by Galway County Council, is successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As most Deputies will be aware, a new urban renewal scheme is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998.  The scheme broadly follows the recommendations in the consultants' study carried out as part of a review of the various urban renewal schemes as they have operated until now.  Under the new scheme there is scope for much more local involvement in the planning and operation of the scheme than has been the case until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County councils and boroughs were asked to prepare integrated area plans for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  These plans were prepared in accordance with guidelines which set out the criteria to be used in the selection of areas and advise on the content of these plans.  These local authorities were responsible for the selection and prioritisation of areas for inclusion in <Col N="1373" /> integrated area plans.  The guidelines also provided that wide, cross-sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in the preparation of each plan.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council submitted an integrated area plan for Tuam.  While the plans must obviously address issues of physical renewal, they do so within a broader socio-economic context. They are expected to set out a range of objectives for the future development of the disadvantaged urban areas to which they relate and are required to balance physical development against social, economic and community development, conservation  and environmental and amenity improvements.</P>
    <P>I established a broadly based expert advisory panel on urban renewal last year.  This panel will assess the plans and make recommendations on the designation of areas for tax incentives.  Integrated area plans from various relevant local authorities have now been received in the Department.  Until such time as all plans have been examined by the expert advisory panel, considered further by my Department in the light of the panel's recommendations and decisions are taken on the extent to which designation is to be applied, it will not be possible to say which towns are likely to be included in the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Completing this extensive preparatory process will stand to the new scheme in the long run.  It will ensure clarity on the role which physical renewal can play in the wider social and economic renewal of the areas which will be designated.  In that way, we will secure a better quality of life for those living and working in the areas concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this matter of considerable public importance.  This morning's newspapers report the decision of the High Court to rule against a young couple from my constituency who believed that they had, last October, entered into a valid contract to purchase a house to be built in the Tallaght area for £129,000, only to find four months later that the price had been increased to £165,000 by the builder.  That is an increase of £36,000 or 28 per cent.  The increase in the house price building index for the year to December 1997 was 3.8 per cent.  Building materials are substantially sourced in the domestic economy where the latest inflation figure is 2.1 per cent.  Labour costs under Partnership 2000 for the four months in question were just in excess of 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice McCracken said he had &ldquo;very considerable sympathy&rdquo; for the plight of the young couple but because of the manner in which the sales procedure is now deliberately stipulated by the builder, no contract existed.  He went on to remark that &ldquo;this is happening a great deal&rdquo; and Members know that the learned judge is correct. I know from constituency experience that this practice is not restricted to this house or builder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> It blatantly exploits the current market buoyancy to the detriment of young couples who have struggled to the limit of their means to buy the house of their dreams in good faith only to belatedly discover that no contract exists.</P>
    <P>In normal contract law, if I offer to sell my house for a specified consideration and an individual accepts that offer and further pays a deposit, then a contract exists that normally is capable of being enforced in the courts.  However, the current boom has allowed the industry and its expert advisers to devise sales procedures that &mdash; although designed to lure young home seekers into believing they have made a valid purchase &mdash; expressly provide in writing that a contract only exists when legal documents are exchanged. Although builders have no difficulty about accepting deposits, called &ldquo;booking fees&rdquo;, no advantage is necessarily conferred on the purchaser.  In a great many cases young couples believe they have actually entered into a valid contract and that the booking fee constitutes part performance of that contract.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the package of measures announced by Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, following the publication of the Bacon report that addresses this practice widely engaged in by the industry.  Government would not tolerate blatant profiteering in other areas of commercial life, yet housing is a basic human need and, consequently, there is an obligation on the Government to stop anti-social profiteering.  House prices have already spiralled out of the reach of workers on average industrial pay.  Finding themselves gazumped in these circumstances is especially cruel and places the victims of this practice at a further disadvantage in that prices have continued to rise in the interim.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to intervene by outlawing the sales procedures designed to circumvent normal contract law and to have examined as a matter of urgency whether in certain circumstances competition law might be invoked to protect the purchasers.  The Minister of State will agree that a 28 per cent increase in four months cannot be justified on any rational argument.  If he refuses to act, builders now have the green light from the courts to hold out the prospect of home ownership to young couples and then snatch it away if higher profits are on offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have press reports on the High Court action referred to, to the effect that a couple agreed last October to buy a new house &ldquo;off the plans&rdquo; for £129,000 and were told last February by the builder that the price had risen to £165,000 due in part apparently to changes in exchange rates, a claim I find unconvincing.  The report indicated there was no signed contract, only a receipt for a £2,000 booking deposit.  It was apparently stipulated that the deposit was received on behalf of the vendor as a sign of intent only, without obligation on either party <Col N="1375" /> until such time as a formal contract was exchanged between vendor and purchaser.</P>
      <P>Aside from the legal issues which have been determined by the court, this type of situation, where prospective house buyers pay a booking deposit, albeit subject to subsequent exchange of contract, and a few months later find themselves either having to pay a much higher price than originally quoted or else abandon their plans, is totally unsatisfactory and undesirable.  The recent Bacon report on house prices referred to a number of market practices which were, at the very least, not in the best interests of consumers. These include the practice of phased release of new developments &mdash; where this approach is used to ratchet-up prices &mdash; the return of booking deposits and subsequent gazumping of prices and instances of excessive stage payments.  The consultants stressed that it is not considered that such practices are widespread but where they occur it was to the detriment of consumers.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in this type of situation the prospective purchaser is at a distinct disadvantage. The seller is, in a rising housing market, likely to be able to find an alternative buyer without difficulty and at the higher price.  However, the prospective buyer who, having paid a deposit has geared his or her plans and finances accordingly, is likely to be the loser.  If the booking deposit system is to continue to operate it should do so in an even handed manner whereby, other things being equal and having regard to the valid interests of both parties, the transaction should proceed on the terms initially envisaged.  A situation should not arise whereby the prospective purchaser is effectively prevented from proceeding because the house price has increased unduly and without reasonable cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most effective way to prevent the occurrence of such problems is to remove the conditions that allow them to happen.  Bacon considered that, if the market was not in disequilibrium in the first instance, it would be very difficult for builders to sustain such practices.  The package of measures announced in the Government's &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; is designed to dampen house price escalation, remove overheating and distortions in the housing market and ensure a balanced and orderly market.  As a result, the scope for the sort of practices in question should be greatly diminished. Regarding specific action in relation to gazumping, the consultants' report suggested that the professional representative body of home builders could play a positive role and that the adoption by builders of a written recommended code of best practice would be a beneficial step.  The consultants went on to suggest that, if it was found that such a code of practice could not be implemented effectively on a voluntary basis by the professional representative body of home builders, consideration should be given to widening the statutory powers of the Office of the Director Consumer Affairs.  Such an approach <Col N="1376" /> would also involve consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise as a consumer protection issue.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would also have an interest in the context of any possible statutory provisions from the point of view of the implications in relation to contract law.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, the voluntary approach would prove to be achievable and effective and I would like to use this opportunity to exhort all concerned to co-operate in that regard.  In particular, I encourage the house builders representative organisation to give a positive lead in the development of voluntary arrangements and call on individual builders and indeed vendors generally, to act responsibly so that we do not see a recurrence of the sort of situation to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I will raise this issue with the Irish Home Builders Association this week.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for selecting this matter on the Adjournment.  I received many telephone calls about it at the weekend.  Islanders are annoyed that they must vote in the forthcoming referenda on 19 rather than 22 May. After the general election last June they were told that would be the last time they would have to vote on a different day from people on the mainland in summer elections.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty Members talked about bringing people in Europe together and achieving rights for all citizens in Europe, yet our islanders must vote three days before people on the mainland.  There is no justification for this.  The Heaneys on Inishturk have a new boat which could bring the returning officer and his or her staff to and from the island on polling day.  Chris O'Grady on Clare Island has the most modern boat in the State and could also bring the returning officer to and from that island on polling day.  The people on Inishbiggle are not so fortunate, but I am pleased to tell the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that planning permission from his county council for the installation of a cable car has been granted.  Perhaps those islanders can vote on the same day as people on the mainland in the next election because the returning officer will be able to travel to and from the island by cable car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, promised a wonderful package for the islands before the last general election.  He promised to give islanders special social welfare concessions to meet the cost of living on the islands.  He promised them special subsidies for their boats and stated that they would not have to comply with the same conditions for medical cards as people on the mainland.  None of those promises was kept and the islanders are very annoyed.  Many of them are threatening not to vote in the forthcoming referenda as a protest.  Many of them did not vote in the last general election; they want to <Col N="1377" /> vote with everybody else.  In the last election they even had to vote before the major debate took place on television between the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and then Opposition Leader, Deputy Ahern.  Some years ago a garda in wellingtons had to walk to and from Inishbiggle Island with the ballot box.  At a time when we are discussing the Amsterdam Treaty and talking about putting people on the moon, it is ridiculous that we cannot send a returning officer to the islands on the day of an election.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to direct all returning officers to go to the offshore islands on the day of the referenda and not treat them like second class citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this item and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>It would be of assistance to the House if I outlined briefly the position under existing law relating to polling on islands.  Under electoral and referendum law there is provision for advance polling on islands where a returning officer considers that, due to weather conditions or transport difficulties, it would be impracticable either to take the poll on an island or, if the poll was taken, to deliver the ballot boxes to the count centre in time for the commencement of the count.  Under this provision, the returning officer is empowered to take the poll on an island on any day during the five day period before polling day.  The returning officer is required to give public notice in any polling district concerned where he or she proposes to take the poll earlier than the polling day appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a poll is taken on an island on a day earlier than polling day and the poll cannot commence at the time fixed by the Minister due to weather or transport difficulties, it must commence as soon as possible after that time.  There is also provision for the closing of the poll at any time after the poll has continued for four hours if the presiding officer considers the ballot papers <Col N="1378" /> would otherwise not reach the count centre in time for the count.  It is the duty of the local returning officer for a constituency to take the poll at the referendum in that constituency and to do such acts and things as may be necessary for the taking of the poll in accordance with referendum law.  In the case of the taking of the poll on an island, it is a matter for the local returning officer in each case to decide whether the poll should be taken on the polling day appointed by the Minister or on an earlier day.  This decision has to be made, taking all relevant matters into consideration.  The local returning officer does not have to seek the approval of the Minister in exercising this function; the Minister has no direct role in the matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the forthcoming referenda polling will take place on 12 of the 20 offshore islands on which polling stations are located a day earlier than the polling day appointed by the Minister.  Of these, polling takes place on Monday, 18 May on seven islands and on Tuesday, 19 May on five islands.  On the other eight islands, polling will take place on Friday, 22 May, the same polling day as the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals for an amendment of the law relating to advance polling on islands. That aspect of the law gives a discretionary power to local returning officers but they are not required to avail of this power.  The provision is intended to allow local returning officers flexibility if they consider a day other than polling day should be fixed for polling on an island due to local weather or transport conditions.  I am sure the House will agree that such a provision is necessary in electoral and referendum law.  The alternative would be to risk having the completion of a count in a constituency at an election or, in the case of a referendum, the count for the country as a whole delayed in the event of completion of polling on an island being delayed where an island is inaccessible due to weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 May 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 55 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  The programme highlights in particular the provision of remedial teachers and resources for special learning difficulties.  In keeping with this commitment, I recently announced my intention to ensure that all primary schools have access to a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>About 45,000 children in 741 primary schools throughout the country do not have access to a service.  Many of the schools without access to a remedial service are small rural schools in dispersed locations where surrounding schools may already have access to a remedial service.  The level of remedial need in some of these schools is unlikely to be such as to warrant the allocation of a full remedial teacher post.  At the same time, the location of some of the schools means that it is not possible to put in place workable sharing arrangements with other schools.</P>
      <P>More innovative solutions are needed if the needs of these schools are to be met.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I am currently considering putting in place an arrangement involving a combination of full-time remedial post allocations, if necessary on a shared basis, and other initiatives, where this is the more appropriate response, having regard to the number of pupils involved.</P>
      <P>I intend to begin to put in place such a system for the forthcoming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has already been in touch with all primary schools in the country, with a view to getting an up-to-date picture of the level of remedial need in all schools.  The aim is to ensure that any additional remedial allocations made for the forthcoming school year will be properly targeted.  In this context, I assure the Deputy that <Col N="1380" /> the needs of the schools to which he refers will be considered in the context of any additional remedial allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <P>While in Opposition I attempted without success to get the last Government to indicate what the proposed regional education boards would cost.  As I have previously informed the House, on becoming Minister I discovered that the cost implications of establishing the regional education boards were considered as part of the process of finalising the White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>However, while the House had proposals for their establishment before it, there was no detailed time schedule for introducing the boards. The intention was that the establishment of the boards would take place on a phased basis, with a gradual transfer of functions to the boards, within a costed and approved plan, prepared by each board and approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Even though this was repeatedly requested by many Deputies no comprehensive detailed costing exercise was actually carried out.</P>
      <P>However, it was estimated that, on the basis that in 1994 the administration costs of the vocational education system and the health boards were £14 million and £44 million, approximately, tentative preliminary estimates suggested that the operational costs of the regional education boards could cost up to £40 million.  As I have said on a number of occasions, I believe we could have had a more honest debate if this figure had been revealed when requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, when enacted, will provide a framework for the administration of the education system at first and second levels.  In particular, the Bill sets out clearly: the duty of the Minister to provide funding for recognised schools; to provide support services for students, including students with special education needs; the duty of schools, having <Col N="1381" /> regard to the constitutional rights of all concerned, to establish an admissions policy which provides for maximum accessibility to the school and the duty of the Minister to set out in each year criteria by which schools are to be funded in the following year.  The criteria for funding may allow for the payment of extra moneys to a school having regard to the level of educational disadvantage experienced by the students in the school.</P>
      <P>I and my officials have consulted a wide range of interests since the Bill was published last December.  While the Bill has, generally, been very well received, a number of concerns remain. Particular concerns have been expressed that the Bill is seeking to transfer to schools the Minister's duty to provide an education for children.  As far as students with special needs are concerned, concern has been expressed that the Bill does not provide clearly enough for appeals by parents in the event of schools refusing to enrol students with special needs.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the issues raised and intend to propose some amendments to the Bill which, I am confident, will address these concerns.  I hope to publish my proposals in this regard over the next few days.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies also that the major part of the funding of schools is already met by the State which meets most of the capital cost of schools, through the provision of capital grants, much of the running costs of schools, through capitation grants, and the full costs of teacher salaries. Enhanced rates of capitation grants are payable in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Where children with special needs are concerned, a range of special measures are already in place.  The measures in question involve additional staffing allocations and special funding allocations.  The precise nature of the supports provided is largely dictated by the needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>In many cases, special needs children are capable of functioning in a fully integrated environment, with the help where necessary of the remedial or resource teacher service.  To the extent that such children have additional special equipment needs, the Department can make funding available out of a special fund established for this purpose.  Where the needs of the child are such as to require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school, the special equipment fund is also available to meet their special needs.  In addition, children attending special schools and special classes attract special increased rates of capitation funding.  The rates in question have been more than tripled in the last few years.</P>
      <P>The State also provides a wide range of additional funding for education, including funding for the school transport system, funding for clerical and caretaking services, provision of grants for books, and deferral of examination fees in respect of needy pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I would point out in addition that the Finance Act, 1998, made provision for tax relief on personal and company donations which can be made direct to a designated school or an approved body set up to raise funds for designated schools.  This innovative measure will provide a new means to support the work of schools catering for pupils facing educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would emphasise that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a number of commitments to enhance resources for schools at all levels, from the provision of a specific budget for pre-school education to equitable support of students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  I am currently considering, in the context of the Estimates for 1999, a range of measures designed to meet the commitments set out in the programme.</P>

      <P>The problem of disruptive behaviour in schools has many aspects which need to be dealt with in a co-ordinated manner through the development and implementation of good school management practice and prevention strategies and the provision of appropriate teacher and counselling support.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service is available to schools to provide assistance and advice in dealing with disruptive pupils and to identify the appropriate educational interventions in each case.  An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to set up a national psychological service.  I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of this service and I expect to receive this report in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The teaching counsellor scheme referred to by the Deputy was introduced on a pilot basis in 1995 in selected primary schools in the inner city and in the Clondalkin and Tallaght areas of Dublin.  Teaching counsellors assist in co-ordinating a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies to prevent disruptive behaviour.  A detailed evaluation of the teaching counsellor scheme is currently under way and I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the evaluation before the end of the current school year.  Any extension of this scheme should be considered in the light of the outcome of the evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to discipline, my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this difficult area.  School <Col N="1383" /> managerial authorities are advised to draw up and apply a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures in the school.  Such a code is unique to each school as it reflects a whole host of factors associated with the community which it serves.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin has been made available to every school.  The report sets out models of best practice and is a very valuable resource for schools.</P>
    <P>The report also indicates that curriculum change, especially the new programmes at second level such as the transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme are impacting very positively on students and contribute to a reduction in breaches of discipline.  The introduction of the junior certificate school programme will assist further in matching the abilities, aptitudes and interests of each student which will impact positively on the behaviour of students.  Programmes such as Youthreach have been devised where it is considered that a pupil's needs can be best met outside the formal school system.</P>
    <P>I am currently finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service. This will be a resource for school management and help them in dealing with vital areas such as school planning and discipline.  I intend to put this service in place for the new school year in consultation with the partners in education.</P>

      <P>The great majority of schools now administer standardised tests of literacy at each class level.  An increasing number of schools are using similar tests in mathematics.  The administration of these tests generally begins at first class level, six to seven year olds, and the results are used to inform teachers and parents of pupil progress in these core areas of curriculum.  In addition, at each class level these test results are used for identifying pupils in need of remedial teaching and for planning programmes of remediation for them.  Teachers also use these test results to assist them in the organisation of their pupils for class and group teaching.  The results of these tests are also shared with parents.  It is felt that this practice of testing pupils using standardised and informed tests by their class and remedial teachers best meets the needs of the pupils and their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspectorate of my Department, in association with the Educational Research Centre, conducts regular surveys of literacy standards on <Col N="1384" /> pupils in fifth class in primary schools.

      <P>Academic research is recognised as an important component of the national system of innovation in all countries.  Three key aspects of the activity are increasingly highlighted: its role in generating new knowledge; its role in educating and training the next generation of researchers and technologists for work mainly in academia and in industry and the increasing relevance of academic research for industrial development.</P>
      <P>The annual block grant to the universities is paid to and distributed by the Higher Education Authority.  The approach to the direct funding of research in universities has traditionally been and continues to be that the unified teaching and research budget, which forms the Higher Education Authority block grant to universities, provides the basic level of research funding.  The block grant to institutes of technology does not directly provide such a research element. However, my Department has in recent years provided specific funding of over £1 million per annum to the technological sector for research programmes related to graduate training and enterprise development.  Most basic and strategic research is predominantly in the universities while the focus of the institutes of technology is mainly on applied regionally orientated research. In addition to the funding allocated by the State, third level institutions earn or are awarded grants for research from a wide range of State bodies, including funding from various operational programmes of the European Union.</P>
      <P>In addition I have made provision in the 1998 Estimates for my Department for a dedicated budget of £5 million for research and development activities at third level.  The Higher Education Authority has been asked to develop proposals and mechanisms for expenditure of this research and development provision on the basis of making funding available to universities and institutes of technology through a competitive process.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total amount of research expenditure, both externally funded research and funding received via the block grant, is in excess of £100 million.</P>

    <P>In view of the scale and range of the expenditure involved in this area, the Deputy will <Col N="1385" /> appreciate that the information he has requested is not readily available in my Department and would involve an inordinate and unjustifiable amount of official time and resources to collate.</P>

      <P>Soon after my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, it became very evident to me that significant capital investment was required to facilitate the enhancement of existing facilities and the provision of additional training places in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>To address these issues, I immediately established a £250 million scientific and technological education investment fund, the primary objectives of which were to: review, extend and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector; develop new areas of activities where emerging skills needs have been identified and invest in promoting innovation to maintain and further our economic growth.</P>
      <P>The £20 million investment in education and training for the tourism industry, to which the Deputy refers, is part of the provision under this fund and will be spent in accordance with the terms of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The emergence of skills shortages in the tourism sector is a matter of concern to the Government, given the significance of the industry to the economy.  The present capacity of the education system to respond to the problem has, for some time, been constrained by the infrastructural inadequacies of the institutes of technology, many of which were established more than 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>The £20 million is additional to the existing investment programmes of support for the sector and will provide a sustained programme of capital investment in the provision of state of the art hotel and tourism training facilities.  Proposals for new developments in Athlone, Cork, Galway, Mayo, Tallaght, Tralee and Waterford Institutes of Technology are under examination at present in my Department.</P>
      <P>Consultations are taking place, for example, between officials of my Department, the institutes and CERT, to ensure that the best possible solutions are found for addressing the skills needs of this important sector of our economy, a sector which contributes over £1 billion annually to the Exchequer, and which directly employs almost 200,000 workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to say that students pursuing courses leading to employment in the hotel, catering and tourism industries will, in future, benefit not only from these new specialist facilities but <Col N="1386" /> also from full access to new libraries, information technology and language laboratories which will result from the £250 million investment programme as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the perception that third level fees are being introduced under the heading of basic charge payable by students for entry to colleges; and if, in view of the increase from £150 to £250 in this charge, he will cap this amount in order that students will not continue to fear a reintroduction of fees in this incremental manner.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 31 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year <Col N="1387" /> for examinations, registration and student services.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review in 1997.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
    <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
    <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams-registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the framework will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review of the consultative procedures and their outcome after six months, as recommended by the working party.</P>
    <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>A number of measures are in place to encourage more children from the travelling community to receive a second level education.  These measures operate at three levels.</P>
      <P>A visiting teacher service for travellers has been expanded in recent years and now employs 20 teachers.  The remit of these teachers has also been extended to cover pupils of second level age.  This service provides an essential support for children of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>In addition seven junior education centres operate under the aegis of the vocational education committees and cater for about 270 children in the 12 to 15 years age bracket.  A more favourable pupil-teacher ratio of 10 : 1 is applied to these centres and a grant of £200 is paid in respect of each pupil to meet non-pay costs.</P>
      <P>The third plank of provision is the integration of children of the travelling community into mainstream second level schools.  Increasingly more children are catered for under this option and at present it is estimated that about 400 children from the travelling community are in mainstream second level education.  My Department provides additional resources by way of extra teaching hours for schools for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the fact that, while progress has been made, there still remains a very real problem.  For this reason, I have asked my Department to review provision in this area and expect to have a report and recommendations shortly.  I have also met a number of organisations representative of the travelling community on this issue.</P>

    <P>To help encourage meetings outside school hours the revised teachers' PCW proposals provide that in respect of one student review meeting with parents per term, post-primary schools may make provision to allocate from normal school time a period equivalent to the time given outside school.  Primary schools may make similar provision in a manner appropriate to that sector.  As part of the PCW implementation process a circular covering this matter is being prepared and will issue to schools shortly. <Col N="1389" /> I will also be encouraging co-operation and consultation between schools and parents on this issue.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges.  This cost the Exchequer some £77 million in 1997.  It was necessary to adopt this approach because the resources available to fund this measure are limited.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-96 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third level.  The extension of the free fees initiative would involve substantial additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to extend the free fees initiative to these students must have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing needs in the education sector.  I hope that, as resources become available, it will be possible to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>In its report, the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment.  In this context, tax relief is available, at the standard rate under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that potentially disruptive pupils frequently are in need of psychological evaluation as a first step to appropriate assistance.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to set up a national psychological service.  Since coming to office, I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of this service, and I expect to receive the group's report very shortly.  In the meantime, I have arranged for the immediate extension of the psychological service to primary schools through the recruitment of an additional 15 psychologists, who are being assigned to various locations throughout the country.  The recruitment process has been completed and the new psychologists are in the course of taking up duty now.</P>
      <P>My Department has already issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour.  This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment.  The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>Social attitudes and parental approaches to discipline vary from one school community to another, and it would be impractical and even undesirable for the Minister to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on discipline which was commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area.  A copy of the report has been made available to all schools and <Col N="1391" /> will, I am sure, be a very valuable resource for school authorities.  The findings of the report are being considered in the context of planning for the establishment of a support service for school management.  I intend to put this service in place in the next school year, and I am confident that it will greatly assist school management in dealing with vital areas such as school management and discipline.</P>
    <P>I also draw the Deputy's attention to the teaching counsellor scheme, which is currently in place on a pilot basis.  The functions of the teaching counsellor are to co-ordinate a whole-school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>

      <P>The rules covering the appointment of guidance counsellors are laid down in circular letters and deal with: (a) criteria for schools to be allocated guidance posts, (b) qualifications for appointment as a guidance counsellor and (c) the requirement in certain cases for guidance counsellors to engage in a certain amount of subject teaching.</P>
      <P>(a) Each school is given an ex-quota guidance allocation which varies according to school size.  This criterion is objective and transparent and ensures a full distribution of guidance allocation across the second level sector. There are currently 567 whole-time teacher equivalents allocated to guidance in the system.</P>
      <P>(b) In order to be appointed to an incremental post as a guidance counsellor, a teacher must be fully qualified to teach in the relevant sector, i.e. secondary, vocational or community-comprehensive, and must have an additional qualification in guidance.  The qualification in guidance must have been awarded at the end of a postgraduate course of at least a year's duration, approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>(c) In addition to their guidance qualification, guidance counsellors need to be familiar with the education system at second level and should have experience of working with class size groups of students.  For this reason, there is a requirement that guidance counsellors in posts outside the quota should engage each week in at least three hours' subject teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> A joint working group of the National Centre for Guidance in Education and of my Department is engaged in an ongoing review of provision for guidance.

Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates.  An information leaflet setting out guideline information about the introduction of PLC grants was distributed by my Department in early February.</P>
      <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the development of significant new administrative arrangements.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that, in June of this year, over 600 newly qualified primary teachers will graduate.  In addition, the supply panel scheme was extended earlier this year by the provision of a further 30 teachers.  This scheme now operates in 17 locations throughout the country providing a pool of fully trained teachers to provide short-term substitute cover in a large number of schools.  The scheme has already proved very successful in assisting boards of management to acquire the services of qualified substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>However, it is clear that some schools are still having difficulty in filling permanent and substitute positions with trained teachers.  This problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It must be acknowledged also that the level of reduction of student numbers going through the colleges of education was too severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my appointment as Minister, I recognised this and increased the intake to graduate courses by 200 last September.  This was an important first step, but I intend to go much further and to ensure that a permanent increase in primary <Col N="1394" /> teacher training places becomes effective as soon as this September.</P>
    <P>In this context, urgent discussions are already under way between my officials and the colleges of education in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority in order to have a significant extra intake into BEd programmes this year.  In addition, there will be a further intake of students onto the graduate programme.</P>
    <P>My recent decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification will also contribute to an improvement in the supply of trained primary tachers.  I am also exploring the possibility of certifying the qualifications in the Irish language of teachers in Northern Ireland who take Irish as part of their BEd degree.</P>
    <P>These moves make a very definite contribution to addressing current needs and demonstrate that I not only recognise that there is a problem, I have already begun to deal with it.</P>

While this data is not currently sufficiently disaggregated to provide a breakdown of numbers as between primary and second level teachers, I can inform the Deputy that the majority of those involved were primary teachers.  The vast bulk of the courses provided were of a basic-introductory nature and a very small number had an ICT focus on specific subject areas, including mathematics, English and physics at post-primary level.</P>
      <P>Additionally, as I announced on 7 May 1998, the National Centre for Technology in Education has developed a comprehensive programme which will ensure that training in ICTs in education is provided to 8,000 primary and second level teachers during the current year.  The training programme for second level teachers will commence on 8 June 1998, while the primary teachers' programme will commence on 1 July 1998.  A total of 635 courses will be provided.  This training will be provided under the teaching skills initiative outlined in my Department's ICT policy framework document and will make a major impact on ICT training requirements in our schools.</P>

The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available on the number of students who fail to complete third level courses at the institutes of technology and universities.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent for those students entering in 1989-90.  This rate is a high completion rate by international standards. The authority has recently commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, to undertake a further detailed study in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Commission on the Points System has engaged a team of researchers to undertake a feasibility study of the predictive validity of the points system in relation to the intake of students into higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of initiatives being developed in the technological sector which will assist the compilation of a database on attrition-drop-out rates.  These are as follows: steps are being taken to initiate a study to determine and measure student attrition and retention in the technological sector; a national group representing the institutes of technology system has been established.  Its aim is to provide solutions on a national basis to the varied and complex reasons for attrition in both the short and long-term.  It is hoped that the short-term solutions will be ready for implementation this September.  In addition each institute will examine and attempt to address their specific retention-attrition difficulties; a system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and is being applied on a pilot basis in some institutes; other studies, in both individual institutes and in groups of institutes, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures; a comprehensive study of the guidance services in institutes of technology was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education; a study of students attending four colleges and who entered college for the first time in the 1996-7 session is <Col N="1396" /> ongoing.  Data has been collected from three colleges and is currently being analysed.  It centres on comparisons of three student groups &mdash; those who progress to second year; those who drop out without completing examinations; those who fail examinations.  It is expected that the report will be finalised in September; the NCEA, in December 1996, initiated a study into admission requirements, academic standards for transfer from national certificate to national diploma to degree and took into account the attrition rates within the movement from one course level to another.  An interim report on the study was presented to the council's academic committee.  I understand, however, that presentation of the final report has been deferred in order to take account of other ongoing studies on attrition rates with a view to providing a more comprehensive analysis of the problem.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology.  The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I have introduced a range of measures to address the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the key area of early intervention, I recently held a National Forum on Early Childhood Education which allowed all interested bodies, including those concerned with educational disadvantage, to put forward proposals aimed at co-ordinating and resourcing early childhood education services.  A report on the proceedings of <Col N="1397" /> the forum will be published under the authority of the Secretary General to the forum.  Following consideration of this report, I intend to publish a White Paper on Early Childhood Education.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of educationally disadvantaged children are central to this process.</P>
    <P>I also recently launched an important new initiative aimed specifically at children in the eight to 15 years age group in designated areas of disadvantage who have dropped out of school or are at risk of doing so; £2.9 million is being provided over 1998-9 for this initiative which will focus on structured pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage.  The objective is to test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for the young people in question.  In the past week, my Department has invited applications for support under this initiative from first and second-level schools which have been designated by my Department as serving disadvantaged areas and also from area based partnerships and community groups.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1998, provides for tax relief on personal and company donations which are made to first and second level schools classified as disadvantaged.  This scheme focuses on those most in need and aims to promote a culture of self help to supplement direct intervention by the Exchequer.  My Department is in the process of advising the schools in question of the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Last November, I announced that entry fees for the junior and leaving certificate examinations will no longer be payable by students who hold a medical card or are dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a medical card.  This initiative is a clear indication of my intention to make the education system more equitable.  Not charging fees in the case of those covered by the medical card system removes a possible impediment to the objective of maximising participation in the second level system.  It follows from the Government's stated objective of ensuring equal access and opportunity for all pupils to achieve their educational potential.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 provides that priority will be given to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants, especially disadvantaged and mature students, to participate in third level education. In this regard, the latest progress report on Partnership 2000 outlines some of the current developments in the university sector on access initiatives for disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>Following the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, the Higher Education Authority provided funding in 1996 and 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools and local communities.  For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education.  The programmes <Col N="1398" /> will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting these targets and annual progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
    <P>These initiatives in the university sector are one element of the wide range of measures in place to improve participation at third level.  The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and on the transition from second to third level is well established.  In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels. These measures, in addition to those mentioned above, also include the development of Early Start centres, the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas, the Breaking the Cycle initiative, the home-school-community liaison scheme and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
    <P>Specifically at third level, I introduced the new national certificate in technology course, which was developed by a joint education-industry task force and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, and which commenced in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology.  I have also announced that the Government has given approval for the creation of a new third level institution in Blanchardstown to serve the west of Dublin.  The establishment board will be charged with completing strategic planning for the institution and making arrangements for the commencement of courses.  The new institution, to be called the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, will meet two very important needs, namely; to increase participation in third level education in west Dublin, an area with one of the lowest participation rates in the country and, to help meet the skills requirements of expanding industries.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problems of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>The Stay Safe programme has been updated in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the user's handbook and lesson plans have been revised.  A new video has also been produced.  The introduction of the updated Stay Safe pack to primary schools throughout the country is taking place this school term.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, following discussions between the child abuse prevention programme team and the management authorities of Scoil Lorcáin, it has been agreed that the CAPP co-ordinator will hold a meeting for teachers and parents in the school in June this year where these revised materials will be presented.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CAPP team is now providing a co-teaching service for a small number of the schools which have not yet introduced the Stay Safe programme, whereby a designated CAPP teacher teaches the programme with the class teacher.  My officials have been informed that the board of management and principal of Scoil Lorcáin have agreed that co-teaching will take place in the school in September 1998.</P>

      <P>Job sharing arrangements involving permanent teachers based in the same school have been a feature within primary schools since 1995. A limited number of job sharing arrangements involving permanent teachers in different primary schools have been in place since September 1997. These latter arrangements are being extended from September 1998.</P>
      <P>A permanent job sharing scheme for teachers in second level schools is being introduced for the 1998-99 school year.  It replaces the pilot scheme which has operated since September 1993.  The terms of the new scheme are outlined in a circular letter which my Department proposes to issue to the managerial authorities of all second level schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate school secretaries employed under the Department's 1978 scheme for the employment of secretaries in primary and secondary schools, my Department introduced a job sharing scheme in December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme allows a secretary to job share without a partner.  This of course means that the <Col N="1403" /> school, where the job sharing secretary works, has the services of this person on a half-time basis only.  In order to ensure that the school can provide for secretarial services at the times when the job sharer is absent, a capitation grant of 50 per cent of the grant under the PESP scheme for the provision of clerical services, to which the school is entitled, is given to the school in question.</P>
    <P>In the vocational education sector, all clerical, administrative and maintenance staff are in a position to avail of job sharing under the terms of a scheme which was introduced in 1989.  As the institutes of technology, previously regional technical colleges, had been managed by the relevant VEC on the introduction of this job sharing scheme, the clerical, administrative and maintenance staff in these institutions have access to the scheme.  The terms of this scheme are also applied to clerical staff employed in community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>Within my Department job sharing has been available since the introduction of a Civil Service-wide scheme in 1984.  Applications for job sharing are welcomed from among my staff and every effort is made to facilitate these if possible.  At present 96 staff job share within my Department.</P>
    <P>A job sharer's network has been established on behalf of the job sharers within my Department which facilitates discussion on issues of importance and relevance to job sharers.</P>

      <P>I recently met with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to discuss its views on ensuring maximum participation in the education system by those who are socially or economically disadvantaged.  I am aware of the views expressed by the society regarding examination fees in the context of ensuring maximum participation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this year I have quadrupled the funding available for examination fee alleviation and that consequently those covered by the medical card scheme do not have to pay any fees.  My priority was to target those most in need of assistance and that is why I concentrated the available funding on the removal of fees for those covered by the medical card scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative which I have taken is a clear indication of my intention to make the education system more equitable.  Not charging fees in the case of those covered by the medical card system removes a possible impediment to the objective <Col N="1404" /> of maximising participation in the second level system.  It follows from the Government's stated objective of ensuring equal access and opportunity for all pupils to achieve their educational potential and increase life chances.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the total amount raised from examination fees was £6.2 million.  The measures which I have introduced this year are expected to involve a total alleviation of £2.1 million.</P>

      <P>Two major surveys of the provision of guidance in schools have been published within the past 12 months.  The most recent survey was commissioned by a newspaper and was carried out by the UCD marketing development programme.  The survey indicated that there was a level of dissatisfaction with the amount of time devoted to guidance counselling i.e. with the quantity rather than with the quality of guidance which was provided in schools.  Reactions to the reported summary of this survey were conveyed to the newspaper by a number of telephone callers and referred to in the article in question. Any action taken by my Department will be based on the findings of large scale surveys and other research projects, rather than on anecdotal evidence.  However, I am naturally concerned that some members of the public have expressed criticism of the guidance service provided in schools.</P>
      <P>In 1997 I received an earlier report entitled Principals' Perceptions of the Guidance Service in Post Primary Schools published by a specialist agency of my Department, the National Centre for Guidance in Education, NCGE.  Fifty four per cent of all post-primary school principals completed a detailed questionnaire for this major survey and some of the respondents were interviewed.  The principals expressed concern about the amount of time which could be allocated to guidance, particularly in relation to junior cycle students.  The main strength of the guidance service was felt to be the high quality of staff serving as guidance counsellors and their willingness to work far beyond the basic minimum required of them.  The findings of the survey also indicated the need for a considerable improvement in levels of reporting by guidance counsellors.  It should be pointed out that guidance provision in schools is no longer the sole responsibility of guidance counsellors.  The introduction of new programmes and syllabuses means that students may also access vocational, educational and personal guidance through the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> My Department will continue to support the development of guidance provision in schools by means of the following actions: a detailed needs analysis is currently being carried out by the National Centre for Guidance in Education in relation to the potential of information and communications technology to support guidance; beginning in 1999, evaluation of school provision for guidance will be developed after detailed consultation with all concerned.  Possible instruments and methodology for such evaluation are already being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>I will make decisions on the future development of school guidance provision, including the allocation of resources, on the basis of the outcomes of these two initiatives.</P>

      <P>The curriculum which is currently being implemented in national schools is a flexible curriculum which is amenable to adaptation so that the teaching and learning can be matched to individual pupil's abilities and levels of attainment. The revised curriculum, the process of implementation of which will begin in the next school year 1998-99, caters for a similar differentiated delivery.  A specific issues booklet entitled Differentiation is being prepared at present by the NCCA and will give guidance on ways in which the curriculum can be adapted to meet the needs of children from different circumstances and backgrounds and with varying abilities, needs and levels of attainment.  A committee of the NCCA has been established to draw up documentation on pupils with special learning needs and disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition to this curricular flexibility, my Department supports schools which are designated as serving areas of disadvantage through a general grants scheme which provides additional funding for teaching and learning materials and for the promotion of liaison activities.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 children with special needs attending primary schools on a fully integrated basis.  A total of 1,242 remedial teachers; 78 resource teachers and 42 visiting teachers are deployed to assist these children.  This includes a total of 54 remedial teachers; 32 resource teachers and two visiting teachers newly appointed in the current school year.  There will continue to be cases where the nature or severity of the special need is such as to require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school.  A wide range of such facilities are provided and each receives a special level of staffing and funding which reflects the severity of the needs being catered for.  It is my intention to continue to support these facilities.</P>

      <P>The scientific and technological (investment) fund, which I made a priority on coming into Government, provides for an investment of £250 million over the period 1998 to 2000.  It represents the largest single capital investment programme ever introduced by any Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The fund has three primary objectives: to review, extend and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector; to develop new areas of activities where emerging skills needs have been identified; to invest in promoting innovation to maintain and further our economic growth.</P>
      <P>The indicative sectoral allocations which I announced in Dublin Castle remain unchanged at this stage and are as follows: £60 million for skills needs &mdash; completion of the programme of skills development announced shortly after this Government took up office; £20 million for craft needs in the hotel and tourism sector &mdash; a sustained programme of investment in the provision of hotel and tourism training facilities in the institutes of technology; £20 million for vocational education needs, underpinning the vocational education sector, particularly post-leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships; £80 million for infrastructural developments, in particular the renewal and reinvigoration of the technological sector, as a crucial and distinct element of our binary system; £30 million for third level equipment renewal grants, tackling in a serious and sustained way equipment renewal in our third level colleges; £15 million for research and development, reinforcing the research and development capacity of our third level institutions; and £25 million for the schools IT 2000 project &mdash; a historic commitment to investment in information technology in first and second level schools.</P>
      <P>To date the following allocations have been made from the fund: £10 million for the acquisition of new and replacement equipment in institutions in the Higher Education Authority and technological sector in 1998; £15 million for expenditure on the schools IT 2000 project in 1998; and £2.3 million for capital developments at Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology to facilitate the concurrent construction of the phase 1 and 2 extensions.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance grants for undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In this context, following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying.  It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid, in all circumstances, would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the relevant country in which the student was studying, at the prevailing exchange rate.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in other EU member states.  Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

These include the statutory recognition of the National Parents Councils; the right to establish parents' associations in schools; the right of parents to be party to negotiations on the composition of boards of management of schools; the right of parents to have access to records relating to their children's educational progress; the right of parents to be consulted when school plans are being drawn up.</P>

      <P>The student support schemes are subject to ongoing review in my Department.  Some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In the 1996-97 academic year, almost 48,000 students received grants under the schemes at a cost of some £91 million in 1996.</P>
      <P>Maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the consumer price index.  Similarily, the reckonable income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The question of increasing maintenance grants and income limits for the 1998-99 academic year is being considered in the context of the annual review of the schemes.  I expect to be in a position to announce details of the student support schemes for 1998-99 later this month.</P>

      <P>I point out to the Deputy that there are already in existence a number of support groups for parents of children suffering from autism including, for example, the Irish Society for Autism.</P>
      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature and level of service will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools dedicated to children a with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the pilot programme of special education services for children with autism which was first introduced in the 1995-96 school year.  This review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the education needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>Pupils transfer to second level schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at different ages and they also take their first national certificate examinations at different ages.  In addition the leaving certificate programme involves a broader range of subjects while the A Level programme involves the study of three subjects in more detail.  Consequently <Col N="1413" /> there are some inherent difficulties in aligning second level curricula in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment, NI, have worked closely in the development of civic, social and political education in the Republic of Ireland and in the programme of education for mutual understanding in Northern Ireland.  There is regular consultation between the NCCA and the CCA, NI and also with other curriculum councils in England, Wales and Scotland through the Curriculum Councils Liaison Group on curricular developments, early drafts of new syllabi and trends in assessment.</P>
      <P>At departmental level the European studies project has developed modules in history, geography and the European dimension which dovetail as appropriate into the separate curricular requirements in both jurisdictions.  From time to time to mark important historical events curricular material is developed for use in both education systems.  The Cross Connect project which is funded under the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation includes development of agreed joint curriculum projects for the eight schools involved.  My officials are in regular contact with officials from the Department for Education, Northern Ireland on co-operation across a broad range of curricular areas at second level.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Good Friday Agreement, I believe that education must be central to an active agenda for reconciliation and this process must start in our schools.  An increased level of cross-Border interaction among school children can be achieved through the new ScoilNET IT initiative within Schools IT 2000, full student exchanges and visits.  I have increased the available funding for student exchanges.  The Government will provide whatever support is necessary to ensure that our schools are to the fore in the lasting achievement of peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at recent reports of harassment, vilification, victimisation and other threats to the health and safety of teachers. Teachers like other employees are entitled to feel safe and be protected from all forms of bullying and intimidation in their working environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the health and safety legislation, school managerial authorities in their role as employers are responsible for ensuring the safety and health of their employees.  This duty requires the drawing <Col N="1414" /> up a safety statement for the school in consultation with those at risk.  The statement should identify potential hazards and assess the risks to health and safety.</P>
    <P>Harassment and other similar behaviours should be considered as potential hazards and assessed accordingly.  Where there is a risk to health and safety from these forms of behaviour, school based measures should be devised to prevent and deal with them and create an awareness within the school that they are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Harassment and intimidation outside of school is a civil matter and should be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>The issues raised may fall to be dealt with under the school code of discipline.  My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this difficult area.  School managerial authorities are advised to draw up and apply a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures in the school.  Such a code is unique to each school as it reflects a whole host of factors associated with the community which it serves.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present finalising, in consultation with teacher unions and management bodies, a circular on the issue of violence against teachers.  The proposed circular will draw the attention of school management authorities to the following issues: the duty of school management authorities to provide a safe environment for employees and other persons present in the school; measures to be taken to prevent or minimise the risk of assaults to teachers and other staff employed in schools; and measures to be taken in support of staff who have been assaulted or threatened with assault and ensuring that appropriate action is taken to safeguard against a recurrence.  I expect that this circular will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>I remain open to further submissions from teachers on the issues raised by the Deputy and if there is a need to address the issues further in the form of guidance to school management, I will do so in consultation with the partners and the Health and Safety Authority, the body with national responsibility for health and safety matters.</P>

      <P>The problem of disruptive behaviour in schools has many aspects which need to be dealt in a co-ordinated manner through the development and implementation of good school management practice and prevention strategies and <Col N="1415" /> the provision of appropriate other supports for pupils with behavioural difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am currently finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service for schools.  This will be a resource for school management and help them in dealing with vital areas such as school planning and discipline.  I intend to put this service in place for the new school year in consultation with the partners in education.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that potentially disruptive pupils frequently are in need of psychological evaluation as a first step to appropriate assistance.  At present, my Department's psychological service is available to schools to provide assistance and advice in dealing with disruptive pupils and to identify the appropriate educational interventions in each case.  Where difficulties are perceived to be more serious, the psychologists liaise with other specialist agencies such as the health boards in order to ensure that as far as possible each child's needs are addressed in a holistic manner.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to set up a national psychological service.  I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of this service and I expect to receive this report in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have arranged for the immediate extension of the psychological service to primary schools through the recruitment of an additional 15 psychologists who are being assigned to various locations throughout the country.  The recruitment process has been completed and the new psychologists are in the course of taking up duty now.</P>
      <P>A teaching counsellor scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1995 in selected primary schools in the inner city and in the Clondalkin and Tallaght areas of Dublin.  Teaching counsellors assist in co-ordinating a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies to prevent disruptive behaviour.  A detailed evaluation of the teaching counsellor scheme is currently under way and I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the evaluation before the end of the current school year.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science regularly funds the supply of computers to schools under various categories of provision. Since the publication of &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; on 28 November 1997, the following computer provisions have been made: £3,720,337 was expended on computer and communications technology equipment for 341 second level schools participating in the leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes; £1,498,987 was expended on integrated computerised language laboratories for 19 second level school centres providing the new PLC programme in international teleservices; £566,478 was expended on the provision of computers to second level schools under the building unit budget; £194,764 was expended on computer equipment for pupils with special needs in primary schools.  While disaggretated data is not currently available to quanitfy the number of computers supplied, the total expenditure under the aforementioned categories of computer provision to schools is in excess of £6 million; £94,664 was issued to second level schools in respect of the purchase of computer equipment for pupils with disabilities and £14,011 was expended on 11 computers provided to second level schools under the school administration project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this provision and as I announced on 7 May 1998 £13.5 million will be shortly issued to all schools for the purposes of purchasing computer <Col N="1417" /> equipment under the technology integration initiative of &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo;.  This will help considerably to ensure that the entire school system receives a very significant level of computer equipment during the current year.</P>
    <P>A further £1.5 million will be allocated this year for: the school integration project outlined in Schools IT 2000; Scoilnet and providing education centres, the Department's inspectorate and schools and colleges of education with computers.</P>
    <P>The total number of computers which will be provided this year under &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; will depend on highly competitive price levels and discounts obtained from computer companies.  The NCTE will advise all companies wishing to make competitive price offers for the supply of computers under Schools IT 2000.</P>

      <P>On 27-28 April 1998, OECD Ministers decided on a period of assessment and further consultation between the negotiating parties and with interested parts of their societies.  The next meeting of the negotiating group will be held in October 1998.</P>
      <P>In the meantime my Department will continue its consultation with interested parties in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Official price control of petrol and auto diesel prices was discontinued in 1991.  In the meantime, the policy of successive Governments has been to promote free and fair competition with the aim of creating greater price competition and wider consumer choice.  Consumers are encouraged to shop around before making purchase decisions. Competition between petrol and auto diesel outlets is to the benefit of national consumers and tourists visiting the country.</P>

      <P>Community employment is a manpower intervention designed to enhance the employment prospects of long-term unemployed people and others who are having difficulty in re-entering or gaining a foothold in the Irish labour market.</P>
      <P>Its objective is to provide temporary opportunity in the voluntary, community or public sectors whereby they could update existing skills which may have become rusty through prolonged unemployment, develop some new skills and also build up a recent record of work experience which is most important when trying to convince employers of their ability and experience to fill vacancies.</P>
      <P>Persons who fulfill any of the following eligibility criteria are eligible to participate in the programme: those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 12 months and those over 21 years and on one parent family payment for over 12 months.</P>
      <P>Special categories such as those referred to by the National Rehabilitation Board, programme refugees who have been granted the right to stay and work in Ireland, travellers on the live register or on one parent family payment for at least 12 months and EU citizens who fulfill any of the above eligibility criteria, either in Ireland or another EU country or both, can also participate.</P>
      <P>As community employment is a labour market reintegration programme designed to target specific categories who are entitled to participate in the Irish labour market and intended to bring the persons concerned to a state of job readiness, the question of a work permit does not arise.</P>

      <P>The possession of credits from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is of no relevance in seeking access of FÁS programmes.  Any person who is unemployed and seeking work may register with the FÁS placement services through any of their 57 full-time and 80 part-time employment services offices nationwide.  Once registered, a person is eligible to participate in a wide range of mainline training programmes run by FÁS, the training and employment authority, which are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking employment, though priority is given to those on the live register.</P>
      <P>Through the FÁS placement services, people seeking to return to the workforce can be matched with job vacancies notified to FÁS by employers.  These vacancy notices are displayed on notice boards in each FÁS employment services office.</P>
      <P>Persons may also avail of career guidance information and advice.  A database providing information on approximately 300 careers and an interactive computer guidance system is available to all FÁS clients to assist them in making an appropriate career choice.</P>
      <P>For those wishing to become self-employed, FÁS can provide assistance through its enterprise training programme or through its co-operative development unit.  The enterprise training programme, which consists mainly of the business appraisal training programme, provides a full range of support services to persons who wish to set up new businesses.  It assists such persons in assessing the development needs of a project and in preparing a business plan.  The programme, which has a duration of between ten and 25 weeks, provides training in areas of business such as, <i>inter alia</i>, market research-planning, selling techniques, business plans, insurance-legal aspects of business, financial research-planning, book-keeping/taxation and new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The co-operative development unit of FÁS, which was set up to assist and encourage the establishment of a commercially viable worker co-operative sector in Ireland, provides grant assistance and advice to persons who wish to set up a business using this legal form.  In order to apply to grant assistance, the proposed business must consist of a minimum of three unrelated persons with a viable business idea in either the manufacturing or service industry.  Grants are <Col N="1423" /> provided towards feasibility studies and business plans, wages subsidies, training and management. In addition to the services provided by FÁS to assist people to set up in business, the 35 city and county enterprise boards which were established in 1993, support the development of small and micro-enterprise throughout the country through a range of activities.  The CEBs can provide direct financial assistance, e.g. grants, to eligible small and micro-enterprise projects, including childcare projects, provided such projects are capable of attaining viability without ongoing Exchequer or EU assistance.</P>
    <P>Childcare is an important issue in promoting equal opportunities in employment.  In that regard, my Department is represented on the expert working group on childcare, which was established under Partnership 2000, to devise a national framework for the development of the childcare sector.  To date, 142 childcare projects worth over £800,000, have been supported by the CEBs.</P>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for childcare facilities for home-makers returning to work and contributes over £5 million per annum to community based childcare provision by way of support for community employment projects. Over 130 community employment projects have such a childcare dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community based childcare for home-makers undertaking training or education.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced the provision of tax relief in relation to individuals who undertake training in information technology or in certain European languages through training courses taught by course providers recognised by FÁS.  In the case of married couples who are jointly assessed for tax, this relief will be granted to the assessable spouse and consequently should be of assistance to home-makers of either gender in accessing training with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Finally, a working group, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is currently looking at the issue of access by women, including home-makers, to labour market opportunities and it should report to the Government in mid 1998.  While the group's recommendations are primarily designed to assist the Government plan its strategy for the integration of women into all forms of training and employment, it will, obviously, inform policy in relation to helping home-makers of either gender who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>Ireland fully supports international efforts, especially through the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to eliminate slave and child labour practices and to encourage compliance with these and other core labour standards.  Currently we are supporting ILO efforts to have a declaration on core labour standards adopted which specifically targets the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labour.</P>
      <P>At its annual conference next month, which I will attend, the ILO will also initiate discussions on a draft convention and draft recommendation focusing exclusively on the most intolerable forms of child labour.  Ireland will be represented at this conference by a tripartite delegation comprised by Government, employer and trade union delegates.</P>
      <P>Ireland also fully supports EU efforts to encourage compliance with core labour standards through the new EU generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme.  Under the new scheme, preferential access to the EU market can be denied to countries which fail to ensure compliance with core labour standards.  This provision has already been applied against imports from Myanmar, formerly Burma, due to the use of forced labour in that country.  The GSP scheme also provides for the introduction of a new special incentive arrangement providing further duty concessions to reward those countries which can demonstrate compliance with ILO principles on the minimum age for admission to employment. The special incentive arrangement is expected to enter into force shortly.</P>
      <P>I believe that the way forward towards stamping out slave and child labour practices is through multilateral action on these lines.</P>

      <P>I should clarify that the closing dates for draftnet salmon fishing on the Slaney and Lee estuaries in 1998 are 31 August and 31 July respectively and not the dates referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional fishing allowed in the Slaney estuary is predicated on the Slaney Management Plan which was agreed between all interested parties in the Slaney catchment in 1994, i.e. prior to the Salmon Management Task Force recommendations.  Under the plan as initially agreed the Slaney draftnetsmen were allowed a five day fishing week from 1 May to the 31 August each year from 1994 to 1998 both years inclusive, in lieu of giving up fishing during the month of April.  The plan was modified slightly last year by the deferral of the opening season until 12 May and a four day week for the first month.  The <Col N="1426" /> arrangements for the Slaney draftnet fishery and all of the conservation measures in place generally for 1998 will be critically reviewed in consultation with all relevant interests for next year and future years in the context of further developments of salmon management strategies, including the catchment management pilot projects and tagging and quota proposals, and in light of comprehensive salmon catch and stock assessments for 1997 and 1998.</P>

The purpose of these new arrangements is, as the Agreement states, &ldquo;to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland &mdash; including through implementation on an all-island and crossborder basis &mdash; on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the Administrations, North and South&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Twelve areas where co-operation and implementation for mutual benefit may take place are set out in the Annex to Strand Two of the Agreement.  It should be noted that other areas in addition to these 12 may be considered by the shadow or transitional North-South Council.</P>
      <P>In terms of television broadcasting and its technology, the situation is somewhat complicated by the fact that the relevant authorities are based outside Northern Ireland.  It remains to be decided whether this area will come within the competence of the Northern Administration. Should it do so, then the development of digital television on an all-Ireland basis may be discussed under the new North-South arrangements envisaged by the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I would also draw attention to the commitment in the Agreement to explore with the relevant British authorities, and in co-operation with the Irish broadcasting authorities, the scope for achieving more widespread availability of Teilifís na Gaeilge in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Libya has prohibited the import of both cattle <Col N="1429" /> and beef from all European Union countries since the outset of the BSE crisis in March 1996.</P>
      <P>Since that time, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Agriculture and Food have kept in regular contact with the Libyan authorities.  Libyan veterinary officers came to Ireland in 1997 to assess the animal health situation in this country.</P>
      <P>According to the latest information available, the tendering process for the supply of cattle in 1998 has not begun in Libya and the number of cattle sought has not yet been specified. However, in view of the excellent quality and high meat yield of Irish cattle and the declining incidence and insignificant number of BSE cases in Ireland, I hope that the Libyan authorities will lift their restrictions so that Irish cattle exporters can bid for the 1998 contracts.</P>
      <P>I have personally written to the Libyan Minister for Foreign Affairs, inviting him to send a delegation of senior officials to Ireland to discuss any remaining obstacles to the resumption of the trade, and I look forward to the early arrival of such a delegation.</P>

      <P>Ireland established diplomatic relations with Namibia in 1994.  These relations are conducted by Namibia through its embassy in London and by Ireland through our Ambassador in Pretoria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of diplomatic relations reflects the very warm bilateral relations between the two countries stemming from Ireland's support for the process of transition in Namibia which became independent on 21 March 1990.  By way of supporting a peaceful transition, Ireland contributed 50 Garda officers as well as 20 military observers to the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG).  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Mr. Seán Mac-Bride, <Col N="1430" /> to whose memory a street is dedicated in the capital, Windhoek, was UN Commissioner for Namibia during the negotiation of independence.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to Namibia were worth £147,800 in 1997.  Imports from Namibia came to a total of £62,700.  The principal Irish export is milk powder and the main import is fertiliser.  An Irish company, Rural Development International, is involved in an agricultural policy planning project in Namibia.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Trade and Industry of Namibia, Mr. Hidipo Hamutenya, visited Ireland in June 1995.  He visited Shannon Free Zone and also met with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>The total expenditure on official development assistance in 1997 is likely to amount to £122 million based on provisional outturn figures.  The amount spent on development assistance through the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Vote for international co-operation is likely to amount to almost £90 million.  Official development assistance also includes spending by other Government Departments such as expenditure by the Department of Agriculture and Food on the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  Specific details on the 1997 Irish aid programme will be contained in the annual report which is being prepared for publication shortly.</P>
      <P>The ODA budget for 1998 is £137 million, of which almost £104 million will be spent from the Vote for international co-operation.  The relevant details from the international co-operation Vote for 1997 and 1998 are as follows:</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that CIE does <Col N="1431" /> not propose to dispose of its lands at North Wall in the Dublin docklands.  Instead it is seeking to enter into appropriate partnership arrangements for the redevelopment of those lands which would enable it to retain ownership and generate an income from the redevelopment.</P>
      <P>Under the Transport Acts CIE is empowered to dispose of any property which in its opinion is not required for the discharge of its duties.</P>
      <P>Last November the Government agreed to the principle that lands in the docklands area owned by statutory bodies which were not required by those bodies for the purposes of performing their statutory functions should, in general, be offered for sale at full market value to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  It further agreed that alternatively the body concerned and the docklands authority could negotiate the terms of an approach under which they would become jointly involved in the redevelopment of the lands.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, I will be working hard to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the decommitted EU assistance will be used to address public transport requirements.  My Department has also been working for some time with CIE to identify appropriate projects in respect of which contractual commitments could be entered into by end 1999 and work could be completed by 2001.  My officials will now be entering into urgent consultations with the Commission on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question on this topic on 23 April last, primary responsibility for this proposed directive rests with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The purpose of the proposal is the harmonisation of the existing laws of the member states on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions to prevent exploitation for commercial or industrial purposes by third parties.  I understand that the common position adopted by the Commission and the member states to which I referred in that reply effectively and comprehensively covered all the issues debated during the first reading by the European Parliament, including ethical provisions, research exemption, ongoing review and the patentability of biological materials.</P>
      <P>This proposal if adopted, should not, in my view, have any significant new implications for the agri-food sector.  In particular and most importantly, plant and animal varieties <i>per se</i> and essential biological processes for the production of plants and animals may not be patented.  A patent for invention does not give the holder an automatic right to use the invention, nor an exemption from the legal requirements of public health, safety, environmental protection or animal welfare.  The principles of preservation of genetic diversity and compliance with certain ethical standards are also safeguarded.  The patent merely entitles the holder to prohibit third parties from exploiting it for industrial or commercial purposes.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect the regulations require that when, all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU <Col N="1443" /> special beef premium scheme are made a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this money is to be used to make outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  Obviously it is important that as much money as possible can be recovered before striking a rate for payment of additional top-ups. The person named was not eligible for payment under the 1995 suckler cow or the 1995 special beef premium schemes.  He will however, be paid BSE top-ups on the 15 eligible cows on which he was paid 1996 suckler cow premium and on the 12 eligible male animals on which he was paid 1996 special beef premium.  As the vast majority of moneys overpaid are now recovered, it is expected that payment of amounts due will commence before the end of June.</P>

The person named had six more eligible animals under the 1996 special beef premium scheme and will therefore be entitled to further top-up payments on these animals.  He did not apply for premium under the 1995 suckler cow scheme but will be entitled to additional top-up on the 23 eligible cows he was paid on under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme.  As the vast majority of moneys overpaid are now recovered, it is expected that payment of amounts due will commence before the end of June.  To date, the person named was paid BSE on two animals amounting to £38.16, £19.08 × 2, based on the number of animals on which he was paid under the 1995 special beef premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for deseasonalisation slaughter premium on eight animals on the 15 April 1997.  This application was validated and processed for payment.  At this time a problem arose in respect of his 1996 stocking density calculation.  As a result an overpayment amount of £360.54 which was made up of suckler cow premium and corresponding BSE top-up was deducted from the amount due under the deseasonalisation premium scheme.  Therefore, a cheque for £120.18 representing the balance issued to the herd owner.</P>
      <P>The problem which resulted in the incorrect stocking density calculations for 1996 has since been resolved and manual payments for £360.54 have been processed and payable orders will issue over the coming week.</P>

      <P>My Department is addressing overgrazing by sheep through the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  An improved package of measures in REPS has been drawn up to address environmental conservation in NHAs and commonages which would include western mountains particularly in the catchment of the Corrib, Mask and Carra system.  One of the measures includes the introduction of cross-compliance to prevent overgrazing in commonage areas.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1998, sheep producers with commonage land in areas classified as overgrazed, including such commonages in areas designated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as natural heritage areas are required to indicate their intention to participate in an approved agri-environment programme in order to qualify for ewe premium &mdash; rural world premium and sheep headage payments.  A farmer may decide to participate in an agri-environmental programme under REPS or in a national scheme operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to meet this requirement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new measures provide that overall framework plans for commonages are drawn up to ensure that sheep numbers are confined to sustainable levels in these areas.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, will oversee the development and implementation of these plans.  I am confident that these new comprehensive measures will be successful in regenerating vegetation in overgrazed areas with consequent environmental benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or as subcontractors.  The correct classification of a particular worker in the industry depends on the facts of the particular case and relevant case law which determines whether an employment contract exists.  In general, to be classified as a subcontractor a worker needs to be in business on his or her own account.  The Revenue cannot dictate the terms under which workers are engaged in any industry, nor does it have any control over the reasons the parties to an agreement enter into that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue recognise that subcontracting is an integral part of the construction industry.  Payments to subcontractors come within the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system &mdash; commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system.  Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required <Col N="1451" /> to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>Revenue has issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a subcontractor.  These guidelines were issued some years ago and have not changed.  Principal contractors and subcontractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them, and that they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
    <P>Revenue have advised me that they are currently engaged in a nationwide campaign to ensure the declarations made by principal contractors and subcontractors represent the true situation.  This campaign includes site visits and entails an examination of the declarations by reference to the particular circumstances of the persons employed.  Where the subcontractor status is considered to be inconsistent with the terms of employment, the principal is being asked to deduct PAYE, PRSI and income levies.  To this extent, it will result in persons who were previously classified as subcontractors being classified as employees.  However, this does not represent a change in the interpretation of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission, an interdepartmental group was established by the Government to study the issues involved, including the economic impact, and to develop proposals and a plan of action. The group will report to Government on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated, the initial rate should be struck in the context of negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.  In this regard, the National Minimum Wage Commission has advised that the rate must take account of employment effects, the overall economy and the need to maintain our competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of a national minimum wage on <Col N="1452" /> jobs, the economy and the cost to the State will depend on the timing and manner of its implementation.  If the general income tax exemption limit for single and widowed persons was increased to the level of earnings of £4.40 per hour over an assumed standard 40 hour week, and assuming a <i>pro rata</i> increase of double that amount for married persons, the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £945 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that although they do not have a record of the receipt of an inheritance tax return on behalf of the beneficiary in this case, they understand that following the death of her sister, she acquired a one half share in the dwellinghouse which was jointly owned by them.</P>
      <P>The relevant legislation allows the commissioners to deal with cases of hardship and such cases are viewed on their individual merits in the light of all the circumstances of the beneficiary. In that regard, the commissioners will give full consideration to the case when the tax return is presented to them.</P>

However, I am advised that the minimum age requirement of 21 was set having regard to the nature of the job and the level of maturity deemed necessary to discharge the duties effectively.  Essentially, the home care attendant works mostly on his or her own providing a wide range of care for elderly people who are, in the main, living alone.  The upper age limit of 55 was set having regard to the position pertaining to upper age limits generally throughout the public service.</P>

I have asked the National Social Work Qualifications Board to investigate the training needs of this group.  The board is currently finalising its recommendations for a training course that would confer the National Qualification in Social Work on those who successfully complete the course.  The course will take account of the wide experience of the social workers involved and will be tailored to their needs.  When these recommendations are received, they will be considered and a decision issued in due course.  I hope that the matter can be resolved without further delay.</P>

      <P>The national alcohol policy was launched in September 1996.  It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place.  The most significant of these are: the National Alcohol Surveillance Centre has been established; a contract for a national lifestyle survey has been awarded; and, a national alcohol awareness campaign was launched on April 20 1998.  The overall message of the campaign is &lsquo;<i>control your drinking before it controls you</i>&rsquo;.  The campaign materials consist of four posters and two radio messages which are designed to make people think about their drinking habits.  The campaign is initially running for a three week period and will be repeated before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Work is ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan including developing the school curriculum to include a significant level of health as part of the curriculum, based on a lifeskills approach; development of policies in relation to health promotion in schools, hospitals, workplaces and campuses which would include policies in relation to alcohol use: and discussions with the drinks industry on its response to the policy, with particular reference to the problems of under age drinking and the consumption of &lsquo;alcopops&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced, and to make progress in relation to initiatives involving other Departments.  Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption.  In addition, actions taken on the basis of the plan will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, so that the policy can be focused and effective.</P>

      <Quest>if new legislation has come into effect in regard to the issuing of medical cards to children with Down's syndrome (details supplied) in view of the fact that the approval of these medical cards is now subject to an assessment whereas they had been issued automatically in the past.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he or she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. While children with Downs' syndrome do not have an automatic entitlement to a medical card the entitlement of individual children would be considered in a sympathetic manner.</P>
      <P>Under the long-term illness scheme operated by health boards, children and adults suffering from a number of conditions including mental handicap can obtain, without charge, the prescribed drugs and medicines necessary for the treatment of that condition.  In addition, children receiving treatment for mental handicap are exempt from public hospital statutory charges.</P>

      <P>Cardiac surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres.  Adult cardiac surgery is performed at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>The following numbers of cardiac surgery procedures were carried out in each of the last five years: 1,181 in 1993; 1,299 in 1994; 1,500 in 1995; 1,551 in 1996 and 1,660 in 1997.</P>
      <P>On 29 January 1998 I was pleased to announce a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Included in this was the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway which will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present.</P>
      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis.  At the end of December 1997, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,371 patients awaiting cardiac surgery.  I understand that the average waiting time is approximately two years.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be allocating funding under the 1998 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  I am confident that this will have a significant impact on the 1998 waiting list figures.  However, at this stage I am not in a position to be definitive about year end figures, given the difficulty in predicting with accuracy how demand will evolve over the course of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 178, 179, 180 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of services in the two schools located on the Beechpark campus is primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Science.  The Eastern Health Board provides assessment and certain other health related support services, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, for the children attending the schools and for other children with autism on an outreach basis.</P>
      <P>The 1995 document referred to by the Deputy sets out the Eastern Health Board's proposals for the development of its autism services.  Discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and the board in relation to the further development of services for persons with autism in the Eastern Health Board region in line with the proposals submitted by the board and my Department's Policy Document on Services to Persons with Autism.  I recently approved additional funding to enable the board to enhance the level of assessment and outreach services provided for children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen the 1997 document referred to by the Deputy.  The Eastern Health board has been unable to identify the document in question from the information given by the Deputy.  If the <Col N="1462" /> Deputy has any further details concerning this document, I will forward them to the board to assist them in identifying the document in question.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department recently met with the Daughters of the Cross of Liege to discuss proposals for the future of the services provided in Beechpark.  Representatives of both the Department of Education and Science and the Eastern Health Board also met with the Daughters last week.  My officials are today meeting with the Department of Education and Science to discuss in further detail the plans which are now proposed for both the educational and health related support services.</P>
    <P>Both Departments will subsequently meet with the Daughters of the Cross of Liege with the intention of agreeing arrangements for the continuation of the services on the Beechpark campus, including securing the future of the site.  The Daughters of the Cross of Liege have indicated to both Departments their wish to see these services remaining on the Beechpark campus.</P>
    <P>Officials from both Departments and the Eastern Health Board will subsequently meet with representatives of the parents to discuss their concerns with them and to inform them of the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason members of the public are forced to queue for long periods outside the Central Registrar's office at East Lombard Street, Dublin 1; if his attention has been drawn to the unnecessary hardship caused by the obvious lack of facilities; the action, if any, he proposes to take to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the queues for services outside Joyce House have been considerable in recent times and I regret the inconvenience to the persons concerned.  As previously indicated in relation to this particular issue, the administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House, is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir-Registrar-General-of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the Superintendent Registrar for Dublin and Registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House, Lombard Street East, Dublin 2 issuing certificates of birth, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's Office, which provides certificates of entries in the registers of births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages for events occuring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office, in particular, is currently experiencing a very high level of demand for certificates, which is the primary cause of the long <Col N="1463" /> queues outside the building and is also giving rise to delays in processing postal applications for certificates by that office.</P>
    <P>While the General Register Office is operating a normal service to personal callers, there is approximately a four week delay in responding to postal applications for certificates in relation to current events with a longer delay in respect of applications for entries in the registers prior to 1900.</P>
    <P>Measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the Superintendent Registrar's Office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices at Lombard Street East. However, I understand that it will take some weeks to occupy and commission the new offices. Consultations are taking place between officials of my Department and health board management regarding the additional staff required to develop an efficient customer oriented service, which will include facilities necessary to ensure the appropriate level of privacy is afforded to persons attending for the registration of events.  I understand that, in the interim, the health board is taking immediate steps to improve staffing levels in the Superintendent Registrar's Office within the constraints of the existing accommodation in order to redress the problem and to minimise delays.  These measures will considerably improve matters for the public attending at Joyce House.</P>

A list of the towns and villages referred to in the question and their treatment facilities is not available in my Department.

In this context phosphorous reduction facilities are being provided in the Claremorris sewerage scheme which will drain into Lough Mask.

    <P>Guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme made it clear that local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic <Col N="1469" /> disadvantage in selecting areas for the preparation of integrated area plans.  The extent to which the integrated area plans submitted to my Department meet the criteria for the new scheme will be assessed by a broadly based expert advisory panel which I established last year to assess all of the plans submitted and make recommendations in relation to the designation of areas for tax incentives.  Until such time as the plans have been examined by the expert advisory panel and considered further in the light of the panel's recommendation, it will not be possible to say which towns are likely to be included in the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday, 29 April 1998, I met a delegation from north Mayo arranged by the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members for the area.  I was accompanied by two officials from my Department.</P>
      <P>The group outlined to me the position regarding smallholders living in north Mayo who are in receipt of a payment from my Department.  During the course of the meeting a number of proposals were put forward by the group and I have asked that these proposals be examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>In this connection I recently announced, with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, improvements in the method of assessing compensation payments under the rural environment protection scheme designed to improve take-up under that scheme especially by smallholders on social assistance payments.  Under the revised arrangements, the first £2,000 is disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent rather than on a full pound for pound basis as previously.  This means, for example, that a farmer who receives a REPS payment of £4,000 will now be £1,000 better off.  This represents a significant improvement in income support for those involved.</P>
      <P>These improvements also apply to the compensation scheme for compliance with special areas of conservation conditions, which is operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and to the enhanced REPS payments for those in SAC areas.  I understand that a considerable amount of land in County Mayo has been designated and, therefore, smallholders in these areas will be the major beneficiaries from these improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Means testing and means reviews are an unavoidable feature of the unemployment assistance <Col N="1472" /> scheme and smallholders are treated no differently to other groups in relation to the frequency of means reviews.  During the first three months of this year 530 reviews were carried out in the north Mayo area.  Of this number, 150 related to smallholders.  These reviews are part of the ongoing process of means reviews and there is no policy to specifically target either the north Mayo area or smallholders.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme under review to ensure that it operates in an effective way in meeting the income support needs of this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government on the level of social welfare payments has been to progressively increase the rates to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment that the minimum rates recommended by the CSW will be implemented before the end of the partnership &mdash; 1999.  This policy is also in line with the views of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which recommended, in relation to payment levels for people with disabilities, that the rates recommended by the CSW should be achieved as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The increases in the rates of payment, which will take effect from June, will mean that the majority of social welfare payments, including invalidity pension and disability benefit, comprising 94 per cent of the recipients will be above the minimum rates recommended by the CSW.</P>
      <P>Following the increases in the weekly rates of payment from June, a single invalidity pensioner aged under 66 years will be £1.70 better off than a person in receipt of disability benefit.  The special increase of £5 a week, which has been provided in this year's budget for old age pensioners, will mean that an invalidity pensioner aged 65 or over will be £12.50 better off.  An invalidity pensioner couple under 65 years will be £7 better off, while a couple aged 65 or over will be £17.80 better off. The differential between the invalidity pension and disability benefit would be further increased where there are child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it should be noted that the support provided by the Department for people with disabilities is not confined solely to the provision of weekly income maintenance payments.  There are a range of additional benefits available, such as free travel, free electricity allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance. <Col N="1473" />  These additional allowances are of significant value to many invalidity pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has made a number of other recommendations in relation to the adequacy of income support payments for people with disabilities, including the introduction of a universal disability pension and a costs of disability payment.  These recommendations are currently being examined by the Interdepartmental Task Force which is preparing the Government's plan of action in response to the commission's report.</P>

      <P>My Department has no direct function in relation to the recruitment of individual gardaí.  Admission to the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and is governed by the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended.  These regulations prescribe, <i>inter alia</i>, the criteria for admission of trainees to the force. Recruitment competitions are conducted by the Civil Service Commission, which is an independent body, on behalf of the Garda Síochána.  The selection process for Garda recruitment, which applies generally, is outlined below.</P>
      <P>Candidates who have been successful in the first, that is, written, stage of the competition and meet the qualifying criteria relating to age and educational qualifications are divided into groups &mdash; there are 15 groups in the recruitment competition which commenced in 1997.  Subject to overall recruitment requirements, those candidates are then called, in group order, to a competitive interview.  It is only candidates who qualify in the written and interview stages of the competition who are eligible for selection.</P>
      <P>In addition, the admissions and appointments regulations provide that the Garda Commissioner cannot admit a person to the Garda College as a trainee unless he is satisfied that the candidate is medically fit and generally suitable for admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Civil Service Commission that candidates in group ten are likely to be called for interview in October/November next.  Student intakes to the Garda College are once every quarter.  The first intake in 1999 is scheduled for the end of January and the intention <Col N="1476" /> is that candidates selected from group ten will be included in that intake.</P>

      <P>My Department is engaged in an ongoing comprehensive, prioritised, programme of refurbishment, improvement and upgrading works in the existing prisons.  The programme, which has been under way for many years and has been expanded over recent years, covers a broad range of improvement works.  Projects completed under the programme include total refurbishment of cell blocks, installation of in-cell sanitation, upgrading of kitchen, education, training, medical, visiting and recreation facilities at several institutions.  Additionally, many projects for the upgrading of safety, including fire safety, security, administration and staff facilities have been completed.  This programme of works is ongoing and it is my intention to seek funding for its continuation of the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the above work, the vast majority of the major issues raised in the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment <Col N="1478" /> of Prisoners in relation to prison facilities have been addressed.  While it has not been possible, to date, to rectify all the inadequacies highlighted in the report, plans are in hand to tackle the balance of outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in addition to the programme of refurbishment works, a major capital building programme for the provision of additional prison places is under way.  This building programme will have delivered almost 1,100 additional places by mid-1999 and this will exceed the undertaking in the Programme for Government to deliver 1,000 additional prison places in the first two years of the life of this Government. Plans are now being drawn up for the provision of the further prison places promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Under the current building programme, construction of a new purpose designed female prison is well under way.  It will accommodate up to 80 female prisoners and will be completed by the end of this year.  It is located adjacent to, but completely separate from, the existing Mountjoy prison.  It will provide living accommodation and necessary ancillary facilities and services to the highest modern standards.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of Limerick prison, a major programme of works for the improvement and upgrading of the institution has been under way over the last two years.  The old closed down D Block has been completely replaced with a modern up-to-date cell block which accommodates 60 prisoners.  It incorporates in-cell sanitation and a range of prisoner facilities.  Modern toilet and shower facilities have been provided on each landing of the A, B and E Blocks.  In addition, the kitchen is being completed renovated and extended.</P>
    <P>In relation to the C Block, which houses female prisoners, initial consideration and discussions are currently taking place for the replacement of this block.  When the design work is completed, it is intended to completely demolish this division and replace it with a modern block with in-cell sanitation and up-to-date facilities.  It is planned, as part of this overall improvement of Limerick Prison, to relocate female prisoners to much superior cell accommodation within the complex and to provide them with a suitable range of support facilities.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, women prisoners are no longer held two to a cell at Limerick prison unless by prisoner request, that is, sisters, cousins or friends who request to be together.  The improved accommodation to be provided for females will be based on single occupancy of cells.</P>

      <P>The Sports Capital Programme operated by my Department provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  The programme currently comprises two schemes. The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary community organisations in the provision of, improvements to, and equipping of recreational leisure and community facilities but excludes swimming pools and environmental works.  The major facilities scheme is a multi-annual capital programme for major sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  Under the major facilities scheme, proposals for funding for the construction of community swimming pools can only be considered where they form part of a major sports complex.  As I have announced on previous occasions, both schemes are under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>No survey has been carried out by my Department on the extent of bullying of teachers in schools.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health and Safety Authority is the body with national responsibility for health and safety matters.  At the beginning of 1996, the authority issued a report of the Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health at first and <Col N="1481" /> second-level schools.  This advisory committee included representatives of the partners in education, my Department and other interests.  While this report did not identify bullying of teachers as a widespread issue I am very concerned by recent reports of bullying and other threats to the health and safety of teachers.  Teachers, like other employees, are entitled to be feel safe and protected from all forms of bullying and intimidation in their working environment.</P>
      <P>Under the health and safety legislation, school managerial authorities, in their role as employers, are responsible for ensuring the safety and health of their employees.  This duty requires the drawing up a safety statement for the school in consultation with those at risk.  The statement should identify potential hazards and assess the risks to health and safety.</P>
      <P>Bullying should be considered as a potential hazard and assessed accordingly.  Where there is a risk to health and safety from bullying, school based measures should be devised to prevent and deal with such behaviour, and create an awareness within the school that bullying behaviour is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>We know that bullying thrives in an atmosphere of uncertainty and secrecy in which the victim often feels a sense of hopelessness and futility against the power exercised by the bully.  A high degree of collective vigilance is needed throughout the school community if bullying behaviour is to be identified and firmly dealt with.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present finalising, in consultation with teacher trades union and management bodies, a circular on the issue of violence against teachers.  The proposed circular will draw the attention of school management authorities to the following issues:- the duty of school management authorities to provide a safe environment for employees and other persons present in the school, measures to be taken to prevent or minimise the risk of assaults to teachers and other staff employed in schools, and measures to be taken in support of staff who have been assaulted or threatened with assault and ensuring that appropriate action is taken to safeguard against a recurrence.  I expect that this circular will issue shortly.</P>
      <P>I am open to submissions from teacher and other school staff interests on the specific issue of bullying of teachers and if there is a need to address the issue further in the form of guidance to school management, I will do so in consultation with the partners and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 220, 239 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>In 1998, for the first time the Government has provided substantial dedicated funding for the funding of research and development through the Department of Education and Science.  The new allocation of £5 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science for recurrent funding of research and development projects.  This allocation is additional to previous research and development allocations and does not imply any reduction in existing expenditure.  It is envisaged that the funding will be available for research and development in the humanities, the social sciences, and science and technology.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is being consulted about the administration of this funding.  It has been asked to develop proposals and mechanisms for expenditure of this research and development provision on the basis of making funding available to universities and institutes of technology through a competitive process.  The Higher Education Authority has consulted widely in its consideration of the issues and has, <i>inter alia</i>, considered the views of the Irish Research Scientists' Association.</P>
      <P>Taking account of the advice of the Higher Education Authority, it is my intention that decisions will shortly be made relating to mechanisms for the expenditure of the additional £5 million allocation.  These decisions will also have regard to the views of the Irish Research Scientists' Association and to the needs of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation, which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for Science, Technology and Commerce, Deputy Treacy, provides <Col N="1483" /> an effective mechanism for consideration of science and technology priorities between all of the Departments involved in funding science and technology including, in particular, the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In addition, the Government has ensured the effective co-ordination of science and technology through the positioning of the Minister for science, technology and commerce in the two Departments.</P>

      <P>The provision of formal postgraduate training and education programmes was up to recently a matter for dental schools in conjunction with the Joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry and the Royal Colleges of the United Kingdom and Ireland.  I understand from the Department of Health and Children that the Dental Council propose to recognise, for the purposes of specialist registration, courses in training and qualifications in specialist dentistry provided by the National University of Ireland, Cork, Trinity College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and that Department is seeking further information from the Dental Council in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further understand that the Orthodontic Review Group established by the health boards has examined issues in relation to training in orthodontics and will include recommendations in its report.  This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.  A number of health board dentists are currently undergoing postgraduate training in orthodontics through UK based dental schools.  However, it is important that the postgraduate needs of our public dental services in orthodontics and other disciplines under the <Col N="1484" /> Health Strategy and the Dental Health Action Plan should, as far as possible, be met from our own dental schools in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has requested the chief dental officer to have discussions with the dental schools in Dublin and Cork and the Joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry and agree a training programme for health board dentists working in the regional orthodontic units.</P>
    <P>Following these developments my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has indicated that he will, as necessary, consult with me to ensure that adequate postgraduate training programmes are provided.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 248, 260 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial or resource teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial and resource teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be considered in the context of any additional remedial or <Col N="1485" /> resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>
    <P>My Department recently undertook an exercise aimed at establishing the precise level of remedial need among primary schools.  As part of this exercise, all primary schools have been invited to make fresh applications for support based on their present level of remedial need.  Responses to this request are currently being received in my Department.  My Department also has a record of all requests for remedial support at second level.</P>
    <P>Schools wishing to apply for the services of a resource teacher should send a written application to my Department giving full details of the special needs of the children concerned.  Schools should also keep their local inspectors fully informed of pupils with special needs.</P>

      <P>The National University of Ireland, Cork provided a three year course for such students up to the academic year 1997-8.  The decision to cease the course arose from requirements for entry to professional social work arising from an EU directive.  The National Social Work Qualifications Board, which is under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, is the body responsible for deciding on the recognition of academic courses for professional workers in the health and children area.  A four year course is the norm for such recognition.</P>
      <P>I understand that the National University of Ireland, Cork is now completing a submission to the board for a four year course suitable for mature students and that if recognition is obtained, the college hopes to offer the course from October 1999.</P>

      <P>While the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1998/99 school year have not yet been finalised, it is likely that Coralstown National School will gain an additional post for the next school year.  As soon as the staffing allocations are determined, officials of my Department will contact the board of management of the school in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department recently sanctioned approval to commence the architectural planning for a new three classroom school plus ancillary accommodation at Coralstown.  To progress this project the school management has been requested to identify a site for the new school.  My Department's architectural staff will then arrange to assess its suitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to accommodate any additional staff likely to be sanctioned for the school in September 1998, my Department has already agreed to provide grant assistance towards the cost of renting an additional temporary classroom pending the provision of the new school.  The Department <Col N="1489" /> has written to the school manager advising him accordingly.</P>

      <P>As an all-Irish school, Gaelscoil Faithleann receives funding towards the cost of renting temporary accommodation at the rate of 75 per cent.  The corresponding rate for other categories of national schools is 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very small number of all-Irish schools, which claimed that they had difficulty in meeting the balance of their rental costs, are being grant-aided at the rate of 90 per cent.  Policy in this <Col N="1491" /> regard was reviewed recently by my Department with a view to ensuring that such applications should be treated as consistently as possible.</P>
    <P>Arising from that review, it has been decided that the level of grant-aid payable to all-Irish schools should be maintained at 75 per cent. Applications for such schools for higher levels of assistance will be favourably considered only in cases where the relevant school is in a designated area of disadvantage.  Gaelscoil Faithleann is not in such an area and, in the circumstances, the level of grant-aid cannot be increased in this case.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of all matters relating to the recognition of primary schools, including the payment of grant-aid towards rental costs, is being carried out at present by the commission on school accommodation needs.  I will review existing policy in this area in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that Our Lady of Consolation National School is included in the disadvantged areas scheme and is therefore entitled to a supplementary capitation grant of £30 per pupil, in addition to the standard grant of £50 per pupil.</P>
      <P>Each school in the disadvantaged areas scheme is advised by my Department to utilise this supplementary grant as follows: £9 per pupil to be used towards the purchase of materials/ equipment, £16 per pupil to be used towards the running costs of the school and £5 per pupil towards the promotion of home/school/community liaison activities.  The supplementary capitation grant is issued to each school in the disadvantaged areas scheme on an annual basis at the beginning of each school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department provides capitation grants towards the day to day running costs of primary schools based on a standard rate of grant which currently stands at £50 per pupil.  School authorities are required by the Department to supplement these grants with a local contribution, which traditionally stood at 25 per cent of the <Col N="1492" /> standard grant.  However, this local contribution has remained unchanged since 1995 at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream national schools and £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged, and has not been increased in line with the standard grant.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In that context, I have secured an increase of £5 per pupil in the standard rate of capitation grant for 1998 and I will continue to seek further improvements as resources allow.  I have no plans, however, to restore the 25 per cent local contribution requirement.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding for mainline youth services under the terms of the youth service grant scheme.  Under this scheme grants are allocated to national and major regional youth organisations which in turn are responsible for the allocation of funds to their various programmes, services and activities.  I am aware that a number of the organisations funded under this scheme have groups/clubs in the Tullamore area.</P>
      <P>Under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth my Department provides funding towards the costs associated with the youth work element of the Tullamore Travellers Movement Project.  Funding is allocated to Offaly County Council which acts as grant administering agency.  There are currently two youth workers employed in this project.  The aim of the project is to assist the social and educational development of young travellers in Tullamore. Funding is subject to annual review.  Details of funding allocated for the period 1992 &mdash; 1998, inclusive, are as follows: 1992, £8,400, 1993, £8,900, 1994, £9,760; 1995, £10,053; 1996, £10,000; 1997, £10,000 and 1998 (to date), £5,000.</P>
      <P>In the period referred to my Department has also provided grant-aid under the disadvantaged scheme to the Blessed Sacrament Hostel for young homeless girls in Tullamore.  Responsibility for this project has since been transferred to the Department of Health and Children with effect from 1 January 1997, reflecting the fact that health boards have statutory responsibility for young homeless under the Child Care Act, 1991. Accordingly, requests for information regarding the current administration and operations of this project would be more appropriate directed to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>During the period that my Department was responsible for the project, funding was allocated to the Midland Health Board which acted as grant administering agency.  Details of funding allocated for the period 1992-1996, inclusive, are as follows: 1992, £18,400, 1993, £10,000, 1994, £17,000; 1995, £17,510; 1996, £17,510.</P>

      <P>The Beechpark site currently houses a range of facilities including three schools for children with special needs.

      <P>I understand that the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross of Lie ge, who own the site, are currently considering the disposal of part of the site.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have detailed information on the standard of facilities in every one of the country's 3,300 primary schools.  There is an ongoing requirement to update facililities in school buildings in order to deliver the curriculum in the best possible manner.  My Department responds to this requirement within the resources available.</P>
      <P>This year, the Government has allocated £39.3 million capital funding for primary schools, which represents an increase of 42 per cent on the equivalent 1997 allocation.  This substantially increased allocation will make a significant impact in improving primary school facilities.  The renewal of sub-standard accommodation at primary school level is a key priority for this Government.</P>
      <P>Proper maintenance of existing facilities is vital to preserve the standard of accommodation at a school.  The maintenance of existing facilities at a primary school is a matter in the first instance for the school management and falls to be funded from the annual capitation grant.  In addition, a devolved grant scheme is in operation under which each national school is paid an annual capital grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil, which can be spent on improving existing facilities.</P>

      <P>The importance of co-operation in the delivery of education and care services for children with special needs was one of the issues identified by the special education review committee which reported in 1993.</P>
      <P>In line with recommendations of the special committee, an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on services for young people with special educational needs was established in 1995. The terms of reference of the committee are: to identify existing and anticipated areas of service delivery where improved or modified approaches or structures are required; in respect of each area identified, to bring forward recommendations for future approaches, specifying in each case the respective roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and their agents; to make such further recommendations as are considered necessary or desirable for the achievement of a more effective and efficient delivery of services to special needs children; to co-ordinate policy and monitor service delivery on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>This committee, which is chaired by an official of my Department, is comprised of a core membership of administrative and professional staff from my Department and the Department of Health and Children.  Membership of the committee is supplemented where necessary to address particular issues.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the work of this committee, coupled with the ongoing co-operation which takes place at various levels between education and care service providers, will ensure that the best possible level of service is made available to the children in question.</P>
