      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The notices to move the Adjournment of the Dáil are from Deputies Rabbitte, Noonan, Joe Higgins and Quinn.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call Deputy Rabbitte to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given you notice, a Cheann Comhairle, of my intention to request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest: the disclosures on RTE news last night that National Irish Bank had been involved in a <Col N="222" /> systematic scheme of rounding up interest charges and imposing additional bank charges without the knowledge of the customer and that no customer has been repaid despite these procedures having been highlighted in internal audits. In the light of these disclosures and the earlier allegations of organised tax evasion, I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to use the powers available to her under section 8 of the Companies Act to appoint an inspector to carry out and publish a thorough investigation into the activities of this bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that Dáil Éireann be suspended in accordance with Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of urgency and significant importance: the allegations made by RTE that National Irish Bank was involved in deducting significant amounts of money from customers' accounts in an arbitrary manner without the knowledge of their customers and in a manner which appears to be fraudulent and the further allegation that banking fees were applied to certain accounts in an arbitrary fashion without reference to any service provided and without the agreement or prior knowledge of the account holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 on the following specific matter of grave public importance and interest: the widespread defrauding of its customers by National Irish Bank and the implications for the banking system generally in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31, I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following matter of national importance: the admission yesterday by National Irish Bank that it had been improperly taking money from its customers' accounts, that it subsequently failed to inform its clients or return the money taken, that it failed to compensate them in any fashion, the inadequacy of the Government's response to this crisis in our banking system and the need to consider the withdrawal of National Irish Bank's banking licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 31.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.  If private notice questions are tabled today on this subject, I will allow them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Chair notice that I will return to this subject to seek Government time to discuss the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I give notice to the Chair that in view of its ruling I will ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider the effectiveness of this Standing Order.  If this matter does not warrant the adjournment of the Dáil it is hard to contemplate what matter would warrant it.  To <Col N="223" /> be orderly and not to dispute the Chair's ruling, I wish in all courtesy to give the Chair notice that this matter and the Standing Order should be considered in due course by the committee which the Ceann Comhairle chairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify that matter.  The criteria laid down for allowing a motion to adjourn the Dáil in the informal report on Dáil reform in 1972 do not allow this matter to be raised.  It is a matter for the Members to amend the Standing Order.  I will faithfully implement any amendment to the Standing Order but as it stands it is not possible to allow this matter now.  I have given it full consideration and indicated I will allow the matter to be raised by private notice question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the matter of inviting, quite properly, private notice questions, there is a necessity for the private notice question and answer session to be accompanied by the facility to make statements in the House on the biggest crisis ever facing the banking industry in this country.  We must have the facility to make statements in advance of the question and answer session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for indicating he will allow private notice questions on this matter. I put it to him and the Taoiseach that if one cannot trust one's bank manager one cannot trust anybody.  This issue goes to the core of the banking system and this House must be seen to respond today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an opportunity for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that while private notice questions provide an important opportunity to ask questions it is not a sufficient response.  I respectfully request the Taoiseach to bring in a supplementary order to allow statements and questions in the House today so that the Government can commence at this late stage to restore credibility to the banking system despite the fact that it has done nothing to do that over the past seven to eight weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I have carefully studied Standing Orders and I must take the words as they appear in them, but I cannot understand the Chair's ruling on this matter of grave public importance.  If this continues, Standing Order No. 31 should be removed because it is a sham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>My ruling is in line with longstanding practice.  I suggested that if Members want to change the rules they have the power to change the conditions under which matters can be raised under Standing Order 31, but we cannot do that now.  I call on the Taoiseach to take the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="224" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I do that, like all Members and the public, I was shocked to hear of these unprecedented acts and I totally abide by the Chair's ruling.  In regard to the combined wishes of the House, Deputy Owen said we should have statements and that is entirely satisfactory to the Government.  If, as Deputy Rabbitte said, Members want to use the private notice questions to have a combined statements and a question and answer session the Government has no difficulty with that.  I know the Chair is restricted in this regard under the Standing Order.</P>
      <P>This matter surfaced yesterday at tea time and I know Deputy Noonan has to say things, but regarding the other matters concerning the earlier revelations, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the authorised officer under the insurance Act are examining those matters.  The Government is concerned to ensure the protection of the interests of the customers of National Irish Bank, to ensure they are repaid the money fraudulently removed from their accounts with interest and compensation, that a full explanation is made available to the public relating to all the circumstances surrounding these disclosures and that what appears to have been a fraudulent practice is not currently in operation in this Bank.  It is also concerned to ensure that the banking system generally is not in any way tainted by similar practices, which as Deputy Noonan said is extremely important, and to achieve those objectives. It is important to say this at the start of business.  I would like the House to note that the Governor of the Central Bank is intervening and interviewing the Chairman of National Irish Bank.  I would also like the House to know that the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment is considering her legal powers under the Companies Act to arrange for a full investigation of the bank under that Act in conjunction with the Attorney General and that the Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. William Fagan, will be asked to review the procedures established under the Consumer Credit Act.  In the event that it transpires there is clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing steps will be taken to ensure that appropriate procedures are put in place.  In conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have also been in contact with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána seeking an investigation into the irregularities of National Irish Bank and I expect he will initiate an investigation as a matter of urgency. That is an operational matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>This is very unusual.  I gave the Chair notice that we would be seeking Government time to have statements and questions, the Taoiseach has started to make a statement and we will not have a chance to make any intervention at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I did not make myself crystal clear.  Deputy Owen proposed we should have statements on this matter.  That was also requested by Deputy Noonan and Deputies Rabbitte and Quinn requested a comprehensive session of statements and questions and answers, that is acceptable.  It is a matter for the Whips to agree how we should do this, but those proposals are acceptable.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about this matter as is the Government.  We worked on this until the early hours of the morning and in the absence of any rational explanation from the bank concerned it seems that the information disclosed by RTE amounts to fraudulent behaviour.  The bank must be made accountable, its customers must be properly compensated and steps must be undertaken to ensure that the banking system is not tainted by this activity.  All this must be done to ensure the preservation of national and international confidence in our banking system and we intend to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be absolutely clear about this.  This side of the House is looking for statements followed by questions, not a limited private notice question session.  Is the Taoiseach giving Government time for full statements not only by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but also by the Minister for Finance?  Why did the Taoiseach not introduce a supplementary order to provide for that?  Why did it have to be dragged out of him by the Opposition?</P>

      <P>I welcome the steps the Taoiseach has taken to deal with this crisis in our banking system and his willingness to allow statements here.  I emphasise time should be allowed for them this morning because the period of an hour or less after Question Time from approximately 3.45 p.m. to 4.45 p.m. is not sufficient for statements and questions.  The period allocated for this matter should be the time slot after item No. 21 which is due to conclude at 11.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>We should have statements followed by questions and answers for two hours from 11.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I will try to be of assistance.  I welcome the offer by the Taoiseach in advance of the Order of Business to, in effect, alter it subject to agreement by the Whips.  With regard to Deputy De Rossa's remarks, rather than taking Private Notice Questions at 3.45 p.m., before the Taoiseach formally announces the Order of Business which to a certain extent he has pre-empted, will he consider, after the items relating to the Amsterdam Treaty have been disposed of and No. 5 has been reached, taking statements and questions then and allocate two hours for them?

I am anxious that the Tánaiste attend that meeting as it is important to get these matters right before we make our case in the courts.

      <P>I thank the Members who spoke on all Stages of the debate on this Bill.  The debate has demonstrated the wide measure of support that exists in Dáil Éireann for continuing European integration and for Ireland to play a full part in it.  It is in all our interests that Ireland should be at the forefront of the process of European integration.  The benefits which have flowed to Ireland through such participation have not just been financial.  They have touched on every aspect of life in Ireland and have contributed centrally to the success and selfconfidence we enjoy today.  As indicated at the outset, ratification enjoys almost unanimous support in this House, which reflects the overwhelming support in Ireland for European integration <Col N="231" /> and Ireland's full participation in that process. The Amsterdam Treaty is the next necessary step in the creation of a larger, more responsive and ultimately more successful European Union.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill amends the law contained in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1997.  The purpose is to expressly provide, subject to certain conditions, for amendment of an instrument which appoints a tribunal, incorporates terms of reference of the tribunal and applies the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts to the tribunal. The terms of reference of such tribunals are those which have been adopted by resolution of both Houses.  Section 1 of the Act of 1921, with which the Bill is concerned, requires that prior to the making of an instrument which applies the Act, both Houses must have resolved that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance. The importance of the provisions contained in the Acts of 1921, as amended by Acts of 1979 and 1997, is that they give to a tribunal certain powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court for evidential purposes.</P>
      <P>Tribunals of inquiry are by their nature inquisitorial and, with the powers given to them, are in a position to thoroughly and properly investigate matters of urgent public importance.  The powers of a tribunal of inquiry, to which the Act of 1921 is applied, are unique in the Irish legal system. These include the power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, whom the tribunal may examine under oath, and to compel the production of documents.  If any person summoned as a witness fails to attend or answer any questions or produce documents the tribunal may certify the offence to the High Court.  The court may inquire into the matter and if the person concerned is found guilty he or she may be punished in the same manner as if it were contempt of court.</P>
      <P>Since the Act of 1921 the law in relation to tribunals has been developed not only by provisions in the Acts of 1979 and 1997 but also by the courts which have explained in various decisions that the presumptions providing for fair procedures and natural and constitutional justice apply to the procedures before tribunals of inquiry.  The overriding concern in relation to tribunals is to ensure that appropriate procedures apply to enable justice to be done to parties before those tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions in this House in recent times various views have been put forward as to whether the terms of reference of a tribunal, established pursuant to a Resolution of both Houses and to which the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts apply, can be amended.  The view of <Col N="234" /> Members of the Government side has been that once a tribunal is established, it should be allowed to proceed with certainty in the knowledge that its terms of reference will not be changed.  If otherwise, the obvious danger is that persons who have co-operated with the tribunal on the basis of the established terms of reference may find their position prejudiced under any proposed new terms of reference.  A change in terms of reference, without safeguards, could jeopardise the operation of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in previous debates in the House of the words in section 1 of the Act of 1921 which provide that &ldquo;the instrument by which the Tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto may provide that this Act shall apply&rdquo;.  The advice available to the Government is that the particular words &ldquo;any instrument supplemental thereto&rdquo; do not bestow a power of amendment of the original instrument and that rather what is envisaged by those words is that the original instrument may contain the terms of reference of a tribunal and the appointment of one or more members of the tribunal but the original instrument would be silent as to the application of the Act of 1921.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a supplemental instrument apply the Act to a tribunal subsequent to its establishment.  This view is supported by the reference in the first line of section 1 of the 1921 Act where it states: &ldquo;Where it has been resolved (whether before or after the commencement of this Act).&rdquo;.  This clearly envisaged the setting up of a tribunal prior to the coming into force of the Act to which the panoply of powers contained in the 1921 Act could be applied.  Accordingly, if an instrument existed by which such a tribunal had been appointed, a further instrument &mdash; an instrument supplemental thereto &mdash; can further provide that the 1921 Act may apply to it.  The supplementary instrument is merely a supplemental instrument to apply the 1921 Act and the powers of enforcement which that Act imports.  It further contemplates the making of an instrument without reference to the 1921 Act at a future date and an instrument supplemental thereto applying the 1921 Act to a tribunal already established.</P>
    <P>It was previously suggested in this House, in a debate on 29 January, that since the law in Australia is the same as here, the Australian book entitled <i>Royal Commissions and Boards of Inquiry: Some Legal and Procedural Aspects</i> by Leonard Hallett should be authority for the view contained in it that the terms of reference of a tribunal can be amended.  However, the excerpt cited from the book deals with the position in the State of Victoria in Australia where the Act of 1921 is not and never has been law.</P>
    <P>In England, a Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry was set up to review the working of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 &mdash; the Act which also applies here.  That commission reported in 1966 but the report in question does <Col N="235" /> not contemplate an amendment in the terms of reference of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>When the Act of 1921 was framed it did not appear to envisage amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry or the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed.  If the Act had envisaged such change it is reasonable to assume it would have expressly provided for any such amendment.  It is the prudent and legislatively responsible course of action to create an express power to so amend and put the matter beyond doubt.  Given the doubts surrounding the issue, surely it is prudent that the legislation should be amended to confer express power to amend.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that tribunals are not established as such by the Act of 1921 but by a resolution of both Houses and the Act of 1921, in so far as its evidential provisions are concerned, is merely applied to such tribunals.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Attorney General that if the Houses were to pass a resolution with amending terms of reference, and a Minister of the Government were to make an instrument appointing a new tribunal and applying the Act of 1921 to the new terms of reference, the new instrument would not be an amending instrument but a distinct instrument with separate terms of reference, the effect of which would be the creation of another tribunal parallel to the original tribunal.  In other words, the tribunals would be distinct entities, albeit with the same individual as chairperson.</P>
    <P>This could not have been intended by section 1(1) of the Act of 1921 and would produce an absurd result, but because there is no express power of amendment of an instrument this would be the legal effect of passing new resolutions and making another instrument applying the Act of 1921.  The new instrument would apply the Act to the new terms of reference only.  The Bill addresses those legal or technical difficulties.  The effect is not to create another tribunal but to simply allow for amendment of the instrument containing the original terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Attorney General, which reflects the consistent view of senior legal officers of the Attorney General's office expressed by them over the past ten years, and with which the Government agrees, is that primary legislation is necessary to properly deal with the matter by amending section 1 of the Act of 1921, expressly providing for amendment of terms of reference of an instrument appointing a tribunal and applying the Act to the tribunal.  This view is supported in independent legal advices obtained by the Attorney General for the particular purpose of analysis of the request by the sole chairman of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters for an amendment to the terms of reference which apply to that tribunal.  Independent senior counsel opinion was not sought because the Attorney General or his advisers in the Attorney <Col N="236" /> General's office had changed their minds or had doubts about the issue.</P>
    <P>The urgency of resolving issues now, as proposed by the Bill that has been initiated, is that in the interim report of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters, dated 26 February 1998, a request had been made by the sole member of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Flood, for amendment of its terms of reference.  That tribunal was established following a resolution of both Houses in October 1997.  The instrument establishing the tribunal provided that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts shall apply to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal include the following at paragraph A5: &ldquo;In the event that the Tribunal in the course of its inquiries is made aware of any acts associated with the planning process committed on or after 20th June 1985 which may in its opinion amount to corruption, or which involve attempts to influence by threats or deception or inducement or otherwise to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties, it shall report on such acts and should in particular make recommendations as to the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing corruption in the light of its inquiries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The tribunal's interim report indicates, at paragraph 19, that a number of matters which are said to have occurred prior to 20 June 1985 have come to its attention and that it has been advised that evidence in relation to such matters is admissible if, and in so far as, it is relevant to matters which occurred after 20 June 1985.  However, the tribunal considered that the fact that such a date had been specified in its terms of reference might give rise to a legal challenge which would inevitably delay proceedings.  Consequently, notwithstanding its legal advice and to avoid any such legal challenge, the tribunal requested the Oireachtas to amend paragraph A5 by the deletion of the words &ldquo;committed on or after the 20th June 1985&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the background to the Bill.  I hope I have dealt sufficiently with the matter to enable the House to be informed about the complex issues involved.  In the circumstances which have arisen it is the desire of the Government to clarify the position in relation to the question of amending terms of reference of tribunals to which the Acts of 1921 to 1997 apply.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill and explain how it is proposed that the law should operate in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 1 inserts a new section 1A into the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  Subsection (1) of the new section 1A provides that an instrument to which the new section 1A applies shall be amended, pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to certain conditions which are specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection.  The conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) are that the tribunal has requested the amendment and is satisfied that such amendment would not prejudice the legal <Col N="237" /> rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of new section 1A provides that, where an instrument to which the new section 1A applies is so amended, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, shall apply to the instrument as amended.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that section 1A applies, in the case of a tribunal to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, is applied under existing section 1 thereof, to the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed.  Section 2 of the Bill is standard and provides for the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section 1A of the 1921 Act is obviously the core of the Bill and gives legislative effect to a number of principles in a coherent and structured way.  First, it makes clear that an instrument by which a tribunal is appointed may only be amended following a further Resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Second, it provides that the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed may be amended following such further resolution even if it was made prior to the enactment of this Bill.  This clearly comprehends the current situation of the request from the Flood Tribunal but also takes into account any future requests which are of a similar nature. Third, it sets out clearly the conditions which must be satisfied prior to the initiation of this process.</P>
    <P>The first condition, that the tribunal itself must have requested the amendment, ensures that when a tribunal sets about its task of publishing its terms of reference in newspapers, asking for information, considering whether information supplied is within its terms of reference, considering requests for representation and takes evidence, it will be able to proceed with some certainty in the knowledge that a change in its terms of reference would be rare and then only on the basis of its own initiative.  Where it is contemplated that any change be made to terms of reference of a tribunal, the tribunal itself is best placed, given the facts already before it, to determine the nature of any such amendment.</P>
    <P>The second condition, that the tribunal must satisfy itself that the amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference, is intended to ensure that the effect of the amendment of the terms of reference of the tribunal would not result in unfairness to any person who has co-operated with or supplied information to it.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied the Bill represents a clear statutory framework on the position that should obtain where a tribunal, to which the Act of 1921 is applied, requests a change in its terms of reference.  Where the Houses are asked to resolve that the amendment that is sought be granted and the full panoply of powers which the 1921 Act imports shall apply, they will do so on the basis of the law that is already contained in <Col N="238" /> section 1 of the Act of 1921 which requires the Houses to resolve that the matter in issue is &ldquo;a definite matter of urgent public importance&rdquo; and they must have regard to the provisions contained in new section 1A.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, can be applied to a sitting tribunal whether such tribunal is established before or after the passing of the Bill.  It is important that the tribunals, and parties who co-operate with tribunals now and in the future, have a statutory framework on which to base their position.  The Bill provides that necessary framework.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> This Bill is unnecessary, superfluous and restrictive.  It is legally possible to change the terms of reference of a tribunal by resolution of the Oireachtas.  Such a resolution would do exactly what Mr. Justice Flood requires. A similar resolution would also enable the investigation of the Ansbacher accounts.  The Bill is not only unnecessary, it is also unwise in that retrospective legislation clearly opens the way for legal challenge.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the product of three weeks of dithering and indecision by a fumbling Government.  It would never have happened had the Government not received wrong legal advice from the Attorney General.  I hope the Attorney General was not trying to please his political masters by giving them legal advice simply because he knew it was what they wanted to hear.</P>
      <P>This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has firmly set its fact against establishing and revealing the identity of Ansbacher account holders who may have been involved in illegal money transactions, mainly for the purpose of avoiding tax.  For some reason, best known to itself, the Government does not want the identities of the Ansbacher depositors revealed or established.</P>
      <P>In adopting such a negative and retrenchant attitude, the Government is badly misreading the public mood, which is for a thorough investigation of Ansbacher.  The Ansbacher auditors expressed major concerns about a certain number of transactions.  McCracken made a distinct and pointed reference to this.  The public wants to know; last week's Supreme Court decision means the public is entitled to know.  The Supreme Court judgment is very welcome because, as with the National Irish Bank fiasco, the public's right to know must take precedence over the so-called right to anonymity of those depositors who collectively owned £38 million which was operated under codes similar to the S.8 and S.9 accounts set up to facilitate the financial transactions of Mr. Charles Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All one has to do is to read through the tangled web of events which occurred between the setting up of the Guinness Mahon Cayman Trust in February 1971 and the massive transfer of deposits once the Moriarty tribunal was established in 1997 to realise the extent and intent of the whole <Col N="239" /> Ansbacher operation.  However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who pontificated daily in Opposition about zero tolerance of crime, seems to have a total blind spot when it comes to facing up to the reality of white collar crime.</P>
    <P>The shunting of money from bank to bank and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for tax evasion purposes can be dressed up any way one likes but it is white collar crime.  It must be treated as such, investigated and stamped out.  It should be investigated by the Moriarty tribunal.  There is no reason the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal cannot be extended and amended now to enable it to so do.  The Supreme Court judgment last week is a clear insistence on the precedence of the public right to know over privacy and personal identity.</P>
    <P>It is particularly interesting to watch the tactical manoeuvres of the Government as it seeks to duck its responsibility.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told the Dáil on 20 January, &ldquo;Once a resolution has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas, and once an order is made appointing the tribunal under specific terms of reference, the power to amend the order does not exist in legislation&rdquo;. That statement was untrue.  Has it not been torn to shreds by Mr. Justice Flood, chairman of the planning tribunal, who himself sought an extension of the commencement date of his inquiries to before 20 June 1985?  Here, we have a High Court judge making a simple request to the Government to broaden the scope of his investigations, without any reference to the need for legislation to so do.</P>
    <P>The Government, knowing that its legal advice was wrong, still clung to the wreckage and decided, nevertheless, that it would go the legislative route to protect itself and its Attorney General. Not alone that but it tried to pull the cloak of protection around itself by involving the former Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, went on record as saying that Mr. Gleeson had given the same advice to Deputy John Bruton when he was Taoiseach. That was wrong.  The Taoiseach repeated the falsehood by asserting, &ldquo;Deputy Bruton had the same advice from Mr. Dermot Gleeson when he was Attorney General&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I spoke to Mr. Gleeson about these allegations and he is clear that he never gave such advice.  He was never asked by the previous Government as to whether it was possible to extend the terms of reference of a tribunal after it is established. Indeed, Mr. Gleeson asserted that the Finlay tribunal could go back to the Dáil after 20 days and seek a change of terms.  The Taoiseach should correct the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Given it is so adept at U-turns, it is strange that the Government has failed or refused to do an about turn on this issue.  It continues to dig itself deeper into the hole.  Officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were asked <Col N="240" /> to draw up the legislative amendment with officials of the Office of the Attorney General.  In the course of their consultations &mdash; this is well chronicled &mdash; it transpired that the amendment might not be necessary.  It is not necessary.  Yet the Government refused to concede and put two legislative options to the Cabinet, one of which is before us in the form of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from being unnecessary, the effect of the Bill is to restrict and not to extend or expand the scope of what can be done by tribunals.  It provides that any request for an extension of the terms of reference must come from the tribunal itself.  This is wrong because it precludes the Dáil, the Seanad or the Government from requesting an amendment of the terms.  The initiating agency for all tribunals, the Oireachtas, the elected assembly of the people, will be unable to initiate a change in the terms of reference once a tribunal has been established.  This is wrong.  The Government or the Oireachtas should be enabled to seek a change to the terms of reference.  Of course the agreement of the chairman of the tribunal would be of paramount importance in seeking to achieve this.  However, this Bill is designed to thwart the right of the Oireachtas in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government purports to be the guardian of the public good.  It hid behind the legal advice of the Attorney General by stubbornly insisting that the terms of reference could not be changed and that Ansbacher could, therefore, not be investigated.  That fig leaf was removed by Mr. Justice Flood's request.  The Government then discovered that a new Bill might not be necessary, yet it is not only proceeding on this basis but is intent on introducing a measure which is deliberately designed and intended to ensure that the Moriarty tribunal is prevented from ascertaining the identities of the Ansbacher depositors.</P>
    <P>In trying to defend its insistence that the changing of the terms of reference can only occur on foot of a direct request by the chairman of the tribunal, the Taoiseach and the Government point to the fact that there are no requests from judges, as the Taoiseach puts it, &ldquo;dealing with other tribunals.  &rdquo; Did anybody from the Government ask Mr. Justice Moriarty if he was agreeable to an extension of the terms of reference of his tribunal?</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the McCracken tribunal should have discovered the existence of this huge hoard of money, should comment on exchange control breaches in definitive terms and should talk in forthright terms about a so called ingenious system which allowed Ansbacher account holders to hold their money offshore.  Yet neither the Attorney General nor any representative or official of Government would appear to have been willing to approach the tribunal which is investigating one of the major Ansbacher depositors and ask if the chair considers that Ansbacher should be investigated by him.  Surely there is a duty on the Government to do so.  In the same way as Mr. Justice Flood considers it necessary to probe into areas beyond the original terms of <Col N="241" /> reference of his tribunal, Mr. Justice Moriarty may find it desirable and appropriate to establish the identify of the Ansbacher depositors.</P>
    <P>While the Government may try to evade its responsibilities in the Ansbacher affair it should face the fact that Ansbacher must be investigated now or at an early stage.  Now is the time to establish the facts and clear the decks once and for all. Not revealing the names means that these people cannot be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners for the income tax they owe and which they have evaded and avoided.  The Government knows that the Finance Act, 1983, makes it clear that the Revenue Commissioners cannot investigate such deposits unless the names of depositors are supplied.  By refusing to go after Ansbacher and the Ansbacher names, the Government is frustrating the Revenue Commissioners from getting at the facts.  In addition, by failing to face up to its responsibility, it is fuelling an ongoing public suspicion about the extent of its determination to root out fraud, corruption and tax evasion.</P>
    <P>This perception is strengthened by the flippant language and approach taken by the Minister for Finance in dealing with the recent revelations that Irish registered non-resident companies are being used for tax avoidance.  Some of the cash involved derives from the proceeds of fraud, money laundering and Russian Mafia activities.  It also involves multinationals determined to avoid taxation in the US.  Yet the Minister appears to have trivialised this serious situation in the rather dissuasive terms of &ldquo;all this fuss and recent commentaries&rdquo; while blaming the media and Opposition for &ldquo;making such allegations&rdquo; and &ldquo;making political capital&rdquo;.  The Minister's recent comments on National Irish Bank amount to saying they are all at it and that we all know this has been ongoing for a long period of time.  How can the public have any confidence in the Minister's bland assurance that there is no place for what he calls &ldquo;these undesirables&rdquo; in the companies register of this State when he and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment fly in the face of the advice of the legal section of her Department to the effect that all registered non resident companies should be abolished without exception? Both she and the Minister for Finance have rowed back from that.</P>
    <P>Accountancy firms secured revenues of approximately £40 million by facilitating 40,000 companies in moving £20 billion laundered through the Irish economy without a penny accruing to the economy by way of benefit.  Is it any wonder that the average income taxpayer is angry when the Department of Finance recently published a survey of income tax paid by high earners showing that 8.5 per cent of those earning over £250,000 paid no income tax because of accounting ingenuity and that a further 21 per cent of high earners paid tax at a rate below 25 per cent?  The Government is sitting on an equality time bomb and unless there is decisive action to cut deep and root out unhealthy <Col N="242" /> elements and practices in our commercial and financial structures it will explode.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Attorney General advised that the Opposition proposals could not be met because it is not possible to have anybody other than the chairman of a tribunal investigate a move for a change in the terms of reference. Yet the same Attorney General had to seek independent legal advice and discovered in the course of deliberations with officials of the Minister's Department that it is possible to do what we seek on this side of the House.  What independent advice was given to the Attorney General and the Government after they discovered they had gone up a <i>cul-de-sac</i> on this issue?</P>
    <P>This legislation is restrictive.  It is deliberately designed to ensure that salient facts in relation to other controversies and scandals are not got at. In bringing forward an amendment to the terms of reference by way of resolution in this House, there is no intention of prejudicing the rights of third parties who co-operate with the tribunal. That can and must be provided for in terms of any resolution before this House, just as the Minister is providing for it by way of legislation here.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that one of the merits of setting up a tribunal that has a beginning and an end is that one can advertise in the public media, seek information from the public or interested parties, and build up a portfolio.  Presumably, in the wake of the move to facilitate the request from Mr. Justice Flood that this also will be done and the fact that the date has now been extended prior to 20 June 1985 will have to be advertised in the public press.  Likewise, if a simple resolution of this House was used as the mechanism to extend terms of reference beyond what was originally decided by this House, it would be possible to put an advertisement in the paper notifying the public that this had been done and seeking information under the remit and within the scope of the new terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Government has set its mind against this measure that we on this side of the House want &mdash; doing this by way of resolution of the House. If this Bill passes Second Stage, this side of the House will introduce an amendment &mdash; and it will be interesting to hear the Minister's defence in Committee &mdash; to ensure that the rights of the Oireachtas are respected, that the Oireachtas, as the initiating body, the instituting instrument will have a right, as the elected representatives of the people, to come back here and collectively decide that the terms of reference of the tribunal can be extended in certain circumstances, provided the consent of the chairman of the tribunal is sought. If the Government in its wisdom thinks the terms of reference should be changed, it should be able to put forward a resolution to amend the terms of reference, in consultation with the chairman. That is what we seek and we will settle for nothing less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is unnecessary, unwarranted and an attack on the <Col N="243" /> democratic powers of the Oireachtas.  Its sole purpose is to paper over the shamefaced refusal of this Government to widen the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  The fact that this Government will use every trick in the book to deny an independent, judicial inquiry into the £38 million salted away in the Ansbacher accounts is well documented, but today's initiative represents a new low in this saga, even by this Government's standards.</P>
      <P>The Government now intends to limit the powers of Dáil Éireann and, by extension, the powers of the citizens of this country, in an attempt to cover their tracks on the Ansbacher accounts. This course of action is an insult to the House, to the citizens and the chairmen and staff of the tribunals of inquiry currently under way.</P>
      <P>I will briefly recap the course of events that have led to the proposal of this undemocratic and unnecessary legislation.  This Government voted down a Labour Party amendment to the original terms of reference of the Moriarty inquiry, which would have empowered the tribunal to fully investigate the Ansbacher accounts.  The Government subsequently voted down an Opposition motion seeking to extend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  The Government attempted to justify this action by citing unspecified legal advice that has never been brought into the public domain, and this despite the fact that the primary legislation governing the establishment and conduct of tribunals of inquiry, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, seems specifically to recognise the possibility of amending the terms of reference of an established tribunal by way of Dáil resolution.  The 1921 Act refers to &ldquo;the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto&rdquo;.  The only reason a supplemental instrument could be required would be to amend by addition, variation or repeal, the terms of the original instrument.</P>
      <P>Despite the massive public concern over the Ansbacher accounts and the public demand that these accounts be fully and publicly investigated, the Government stoutly refused to accede to this request.  Its reasons for doing so remain unclear. This buttoned lip approach to the Ansbacher accounts and indeed the wider question of how we establish and conduct tribunals of inquiry was a disgrace and an affront to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may have believed it had heard the last of this matter in January and could be content that it had successfully managed to sweep it under the carpet.  However, its strategy was again thrown into crisis on foot of a request by Mr. Justice Flood to extend the terms of his inquiry into certain planning matters.  I am convinced that when Mr. Justice Flood made his request to extend the terms of reference of the planning tribunal, he was expecting the necessary resolution of the House to be made under the terms of the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) <Col N="244" /> Act.  I do not believe Mr. Justice Flood requested that new legislation should be drafted.  Neither do I believe that Mr. Justice Flood expected his reasonable request to be used to restrict the powers of the Oireachtas to set the parameters for the conduct of all future tribunals.  However, if the Government were to accede to Mr. Justice Flood's request, it would expose its stance on the amendment to the terms of the Moriarty tribunal's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood published his interim report on 26 February.  It is quite obvious that the planning tribunal has serious grounds for believing that certain events committed before 20 June 1985 must be investigated in the public interest. The Cabinet discussed this request at a meeting of 3 March, and the events that have followed since that meeting give rise to extremely serious questions that go to the heart of our democratic process.  At best the Government's attitude to this matter can be described as incompetent, and at worst as downright dishonest and disingenuous.</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 3 March the Government decided that legislation was necessary to give effect to Mr. Justice Flood's request. The Bill before the House was not initiated by the Department of Justice.  It did not come about through the normal channels of consultation and discussion.  I put it to the Minister that the Government at its meeting of 3 March saw the predicament it was in, realised that Mr. Justice Flood's request exposed the threadbare defence of the amendment to the Moriarty tribunal terms of reference and put its mind to conjuring up some new trick to cover its tracks.</P>
      <P>That new trick has now been placed before this House in the form of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill.  However, the Department of Justice, on examining the matter in its preparations of a Bill, came to the conclusion that no legislation was necessary to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal established by the Oireachtas.  Newspaper reports reveal that the Department of Justice communicated this advice in writing to the Government and advised that the Minister should not proceed with the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that a Government should maintain the lie that legislation is necessary when civil servants in the Department of Justice and the Office of the Parliamentary Draughtsman had come to the conclusion that no such legislation is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister has obviously instituted a new branch of zero tolerance of sound legal advice from his Department on an issue of national importance.</P>
      <P>The Minister insists that 24 hours before the Cabinet meeting on 10 March outside legal advice supporting the Government's position was obtained by him.  Was a memo to Government circulated before this legal advice was obtained in advance of the Cabinet meeting on 10 March? When and from whom was the outside legal advice sought and obtained?  Were officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform given the opportunity to study and comment on the advice prior to the Government's decision? What were the reasons officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the office of the parliamentary draftsman had to doubt the need for legislation?  Were these reasons conveyed to the outside legal adviser?  If the Minister cannot or will not provide full and adequate explanations to these questions, we can only draw the most sinister conclusions from this sorry debacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill is one of the most extraordinary documents produced in the recent past.  It states that nowhere in the Act of 1921 is there an express power to amend an instrument already made.  I agree with that statement.  However, it does not follow that, because there is no express provision in the 1921 Act, such a course of action cannot be undertaken by the Oireachtas.  It is clear that the Department of Justice, Equality <Col N="246" /> and Law Reform and the office of the parliamentary draftsman believe such a power rests with the Oireachtas and that the Bill is unnecessary.  I and the Labour Party agree with this view.  The Bill is not only unnecessary, it also undermines the power and authority of the Oireachtas.  If the legislation is passed, the terms of reference of any future tribunal can only be amended on foot of a request from the tribunal itself.  This is a disgraceful negation of the democratic responsibility of the House and an affront to democracy.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents one of the most serious breaches of the proper administration of the country.  It is obvious that the Minister does not have the support of his Department or the backing of the legal advice available in the Civil Service. In the face of this opposition, the Minister has decided to trawl round the Law Library, desperate to find some helpful soul who may agree with the stance he and the Government have taken.  It is farcical and an appalling way for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to treat his senior officials.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not intended to facilitate the Flood tribunal or to improve the system of judicial inquiries.  It is intended to protect the Government from its failure and, for whatever reason, to properly and publicly prevent the people with Ansbacher accounts being investigated.  It is the latest and most irresponsible act of the Government in its ongoing efforts to protect the people who hold Ansbacher accounts.  It is a disgrace.  It should be rejected by the House and all who believe in democracy and fair play and who want the truth about what went on regarding the enormous amounts of money salted away in the Ansbacher accounts, which there is a strong case to suggest belongs to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Two days ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform refused to accept a Fine Gael Party Private Members' Bill. He stated there had to be a real need for legislation that was in the public interest before it could be introduced.  However, those criteria obviously do not apply to this legislation.  The only reason for the Bill is the Government's need to cover its back and to bury the investigation of the Ansbacher accounts once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Bill is shameful and brings the House into disrepute.  The Minister should do two things in relation to the issue which arose as a result of Mr. Justice Flood's request.  He should either do what Mr. Justice Flood requested, which is amend the terms of reference of the tribunal, or introduce proper, comprehensive legislation that reflects the democratic mandate and accountability of the House.  However, the Minister is not doing either of those things.  He is engaging in a face saving exercise to copperfasten a dishonourable position adopted by the Government in the teeth of opposition not only in the House but also among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must pinpoint what is at issue.  The legislation supposedly arises from a request from the <Col N="247" /> tribunal chairman, Mr. Justice Flood.  However, he did not seek an amendment to legislation but a change in paragraph A5 of the terms of reference under which he operates.  He wanted the deletion of the words &ldquo;committed on or after 20 June 1985&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice Flood did not seek an amendment to legislation, rather a change in the terms of reference.  The tribunal was established by the House.  It was not set up by the Judiciary or a body outside the House.  Therefore, the House is accountable for its functions and the reason it was established.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood's request was reasonable. The Government is in a pickle, not because of the nature of the request but due to the position it adopted.  The disgraceful and discreditable approach it took in relation to the Moriarty tribunal has become apparent.  The Government has put forward this ruse to save face and cover its embarrassment.  It could not say to Mr. Justice Flood that it could not accede to his reasonable request.  It is possible that he would have said that he could not continue to operate if that had happened. However, if the Government agreed to his request, it would have shown up its refusal to change the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is evident that no legal requirement must be met, rather that political expediency is required. The Bill is a fig leaf.  It is a shield constructed by the Government to hide behind so it can avoid facing the obvious public desire to investigate the serious matter of the Ansbacher accounts which has been debated in the House but has not been resolved.  The Bill is an act of cynicism and hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>The resistance to the investigation of the Ansbacher accounts by the Government has been consistent.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told the House on 28 January that there was a strong legal view that once a tribunal had commenced its work on existing terms of reference, they could not be changed.  This line has been trotted out repeatedly by Government spokespersons.  However, there is a large body of opinion in the legal fora and the House that this is untrue.  Any reasonable person can recognise at this stage that there is no legal bar to changing the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Government lacks the political will to face up to its obligation to investigate the Ansbacher accounts.  That is the kernel of what is at issue today and the reason we are being asked to pass unnecessary legislation that is not in the public interest.  The Bill does not deal with a common good; the hypocrisy was evident in the Minister's statement earlier.  We know there is opposing legal opinion to what he is using as a crutch.  More importantly, we know grave doubts have been expressed within his Department.  The day before the Cabinet made this decision grave doubts were expressed by senior officials in his Department who have extensive experience and expertise in <Col N="248" /> this regard, but their advice was disregarded and shelved in the interest of expediency.</P>
    <P>While I accept this point was made earlier, it is important to reiterate that it is a matter of grave concern when the so-called opinions of a previous Attorney General are being used to back up an untenable Government position.  It is on the record that the previous Attorney General specified that such a change would not be possible after public hearings had started.  We have not yet reached that stage.  The proceedings of the tribunal are at an earlier stage and there is no bar to changing them.  Obviously, one must be fair to people appearing before the tribunal, but nobody has appeared before it yet.  It is fundamentally wrong for a Government to adopt erroneous positions and use unsustainable arguments that have been refuted.</P>
    <P>This is not the type of Bill that should be passed even if one believes the legislation is necessary.  It is far too restrictive.  Under the Bill the terms of reference of the tribunal can be changed only when the tribunal requests such amendment.  That is unacceptable, it is not democracy.  The Bill provides that the terms of reference can be changed only when a request is initiated by the tribunal.  While nobody would dispute that the tribunal should have a right to initiate such requests, the Dáil must be given discretion to change the terms of reference if the legislation is to be democratic and accountable. Obviously, this should be done only when the Dáil deems it necessary, particularly if new information comes to hand.  When the Bill is passed the Government could obtain new information that would not be available to the tribunal which would necessitate a change in the terms of reference, but the House, which represents the people, would not be in a position to do so.  The Bill provides that only the chairman can request such a change.  That renders the Bill fundamentally flawed and we, and I am sure other parties, will put forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to reiterate points that have already been made eloquently by other spokes-people, but there are a number of points about the establishment of tribunals of inquiry which must be noted, even if they do not relate directly to the legislation.  It has taken a long time for this tribunal to get up and running.  I am not apportioning blame in this regard, but the question of legal fees, resources and facilities had to be addressed. Those issues must be examined by the Minister to enable tribunals of inquiry to start their operations speedily.  The need for this tribunal arose out of grave circumstances.  A senior Cabinet Minister resigned over the point at issue, but six months later the tribunal has not started its work.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the way the proceedings of tribunals are related to the public. Tribunals of inquiry must be accessible to the public through the key means of communication, namely, television.  The public will pay for this tribunal in the same way as they pay for all tribunals. <Col N="249" /> Therefore, there is an onus on the Minister to ensure members of the public have access to its deliberations and conclusions.  This can be done effectively only through the medium of television. It is no longer adequate to cover the proceedings of tribunals only in newspapers, even though they provide a good service.</P>
    <P>This is a sad day for the House.  We are being asked to collude with the Government in covering up its inadequacies, its refusal to face up to its responsibility to investigate the Ansbacher accounts as requested by the Opposition and, more importantly, by the public.  We know the public wants that investigation carried out and it should not have a bearing on the Flood tribunal. That tribunal is being dragged into the matter because the Government is not willing to respond to a reasonable request by Mr. Justice Flood to alter the terms of reference in a minor way.  The Government is running away from its responsibilities and trying to cover its back on another issue of fundamental public importance.  In the past the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform preached frequently and at length about zero tolerance and what is correct, but when he is in a position to do what is right, he is running away in a manner that disgraces him and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  When I heard that Mr. Justice Flood had requested a change in the terms of reference of the tribunal, I was pleased because it highlighted the need to change them.</P>
      <P>At the time it seemed the Government would accept the bona fides of the request and would act on it without further questioning.  When I heard the Government was to respond, that seemed good news.  However, it was a grave disappointment to read in the Bill that the response would be restrictive to the point of tying up in knots any change to the terms of reference of a tribunal.  To use a metaphor, this Bill is a combination lock on changing the terms of a tribunal. A citizen may claim it will affect his legal rights in some way and we may have to face a court case.  This will take us to the point where a judge will be reluctant to seek an extension of the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>I regret this legislation will effectively stifle the progress of a tribunal rather than enable it to get on with its work.  The flagrant refusal to respond to Mr. Justice Flood's request that the Ansbacher accounts be investigated highlights the serious questions that hang over the Government's position in relation to these accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations are made day in day out to public representatives for funding for various projects, including schools and so on while the amount of uncollected tax on the Ansbacher accounts is allowed to accrue.  This is a source of justifiable anger among the public.  I need only look to my own constituency to find similar examples.  St. Ita's Hospital and carers for the elderly and infirm are inadequately resourced while <Col N="250" /> the Ansbacher accounts remain uninvestigated. We hear on a daily basis of hospital waiting lists. Doctors are told to approach their TD as they do not have the funding.  Public transport is under resourced to the point of being ridiculous.  Local authorities are looking at small areas of open space in which to build houses, thereby preying upon the easiest targets &mdash; the amenities on which people depend for some quality of life.  Sewage treatment plants around the coast are inadequately resourced.  All these projects require capital investment, yet the Government allows offshore accounts to remain uninvestigated.  This is a clear example of the Government's lack of concern for basic needs and basic justice.</P>
    <P>The need for the inclusion of 1985 as the starting point for investigation is obvious to those of us, particularly in north County Dublin, who have had any dealings with the local authority where the accusations relating to rezoning are being made.  There are other areas also but that would broaden the terms even more.</P>
    <P>I was elected to Dublin County Council in 1991.  Prior to that I sat in the public gallery after the local election of 1985.  Particularly after 1989 and 1990 agendas on the floor of Dublin County Council were never reached because of the number of section 4 motions at the top of each agenda.  They were being taken one after the other to the point where the business of the council was ignored and probably dealt with by the officials.  The greater part of the time of elected members was utilised in dealing with section 4 motions.  This was totally against the advice of the planners, officials and engineers who were qualified experts in dealing with the proper planning of the area.</P>
    <P>We are not talking only about development plans but the day to day business of the local authority at that time.  It is obvious that one should go back to 1985, at the very least, to investigate properly the background to many of those decisions.  Justice Flood realises only too well, having looked at the issues before him, as will anybody who has an interest in public affairs whether a public representative or not, that payments which are the subject of investigation in this tribunal can be made at any time, before or after a decision is made.  The allegations should take into account the fact that a decision can be made and paid for retrospectively.  There are not many people who would pay a builder before the work is done.  That is commonsense and should be taken into account when considering the request from Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>Land speculation, an issue close to the subject under discussion, is a long-term activity.  Many of us will be aware of land or buildings that have mysteriously sat unattended and have been allowed fall into ruin.  One wonders why nobody cares.  It happens over a long period.  The purchase of such property results in windfall profits for the person who has the resources to invest, given the house price crisis, affecting particularly first time buyers.  I hope the Government will <Col N="251" /> respond fully to Justice Flood's request before public anger becomes uncontrollable.  Ordinary people are suffering badly on account of the interaction between developers and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are entering into land swapping arrangements with developers because they do not have the money to buy the land.  The local people then discover that the owner of land, which they thought would be used for a certain development, has changed and that the new owner is the local authority or <i>vice versa.</i>  Local people are left out of the equation and are treated with disdain and contempt.  That is the feeling on the ground.  If people were to make their feelings known more forcefully to this Government, particularly at elections, they would get a response.</P>
    <P>At present, local authorities are preying upon small green spaces.  In Swords, for example, the local authority has put its eye on a small town park because it does not have the money to purchase a proper site for its civic offices.  It intends to use the park in the town centre, the equivalent of St. Stephen's Green in Dublin city, for building. That is the result of insufficient resourcing of local authorities caused by practices such as turning a blind eye to the Ansbacher accounts and to common sense requests from people such as Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to Mr. Justice Flood's request, by putting this insulting legislation before the House, defies justification.  It means the Minister and the Government will force such requests through the legal wrangles to which this Bill will give rise.  There is already a case before the High Court in which a former Taoiseach is challenging the right of a tribunal to investigate his affairs.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives <i>carte blanche</i> to a person to challenge a request for information.  It will lead to the usual merry-go-round of legal fees which will put in a worse light any type of investigation that might be required.  If the problem of legal fees is to be contained, the Government should ensure that the request from Mr. Justice Flood for a change in the terms of reference of the inquiry will result in a speedy and minimal-cost change so we can get to the bottom of what are clear inconsistencies and, I suspect, illegal acts on the part of people who have been in positions of responsibility.  That is not a major request, simply basic justice.</P>
    <P>This is the last opportunity to take stock of the bona fides of Mr. Justice Flood's request and I urge the Government to accede to it.  The problem is his request is not being granted.  The request has been heard but it has not been accepted.  Instead it has been amended and watered down and forced into a form which, ultimately, will be a hindrance rather than a help to the work of the tribunal.  That is the basic issue which the Government has a responsibility to address.</P>

      <P>It is understandable that the Ansbacher accounts should have been raised in the course of this mean spirited debate.  It did not surprise me.  However, there are legal difficulties involved, which I have discussed previously. Irrespective of that, the Ansbacher accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners and by the authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste under the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated that the proceedings of the tribunal were monitored closely by the Revenue Commissioners and that appropriate action will be taken.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has also clearly indicated that any additional powers that might be required by the Revenue Commissioners can be provided for in legislation.  In addition, the Moriarty tribunal has a brief to examine certain aspects of the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important at this point to refer to the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  They permit inquiry into the Ansbacher accounts to investigate any payments from those accounts to the benefit or in the name of any person who holds or has held ministerial office and to ascertain whether any holder of public office, for whose benefit money was held in the accounts, conducted any act in the course of his or her public office to confer any benefit on any person who was the source of that money or directed any person to do such an act.  Any deposit holder discovered by <Col N="253" /> the tribunal to have made payments from the Ansbacher accounts to any of the aforementioned categories of persons will be publicly identified, have their deposits made known, have the amounts paid to the categories of persons made known and have any benefit conferred made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A deposit holder who did not arrange such payments will not be publicly identified.  Deputy Higgins is aware of the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The question that arises with regard to the Ansbacher accounts relates to the possibility that the depositors might be evading tax.  The tribunal of inquiry is not required to conduct an investigation into tax evasion.  Its terms of reference provide for the making of recommendations for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion through the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts and to recommend whether changes should be made in the tax law to achieve this end.</P>
      <P>Consequently, to make recommendations, the tribunal must investigate offshore accounts to establish how they work, the purposes for which they are established, whether the State's tax base is at risk in the establishment and maintenance of such accounts and, if so, the changes in tax law that should be implemented to prevent this.</P>

      <P>If the terms of reference were amended by the inclusion of a requirement to investigate whether individual deposit holders were guilty of tax evasion in circumstances where the tribunal may wish to seek information from <Col N="254" /> the Cayman Islands, the work of the tribunal could be seriously compromised for the following reasons.  The McCracken tribunal was required to go to the Cayman Islands to acquire information as to the identity of deposit holders in the Ansbacher accounts.  When the terms of reference were drafted, it was believed the Moriarty tribunal would have to do likewise.  That may still be the case.  In view of the well recognised principle in international law, as adopted in our domestic courts, that the courts of one state will not enforce or aid in the enforcement of another state's revenue laws, any inquiry in the Cayman Islands with that stated purpose would have been refused, thus jeopardising the primary focus of this tribunal relating to propriety in public life.  If that had happened, I can imagine the hue and cry I would have heard across the floor from the Opposition benches this morning.</P>

The shifting of the goalposts by amending the terms of reference might result in individuals or institutions who have bona fide on the basis of the existing terms of reference provided information to the tribunal requesting that no use be made of that information.</P>

      <P>The revelations last night on the RTE 6 o'clock evening news contained the most alarming allegations ever made against a bank here, particularly a clearing bank.  The fact that National Irish Bank has confirmed the substance of the charges made against it is disturbing in the extreme.  Banking is built on trust between banks and their customers.  Any suggestion that that trust has been abused by one of our leading financial institutions is extremely damaging for the banking industry, Irish business and the international image of this country which it has taken years of effort to build and enhance. The International Financial Services Centre is marketed throughout the world on the basis of the reputation of the Irish banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is determined that all aspects of the National Irish Bank allegations will be fully investigated by every means at its disposal.  We are determined to ensure that any wrongdoing will be fully exposed.  We are determined that those responsible for such wrongdoing will be named and treated with the severity their actions justify.  We have moved on several fronts to <Col N="255" /> ensure a full and comprehensive investigation is carried out.  The fraud squad has opened an office this morning and wants to receive complaints from the public in relation to this matter.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is carrying out an investigation in relation to bank charges and is currently involved in meetings with the banking institutions.  We have asked RTE to make the information at its disposal available.  I am making preparations, in conjunction with my legal advisers, to petition the High Court for the appointment of an inspector.</P>
    <P>When the allegations in relation to National Irish Bank first came into the public domain towards the end of January, the State acted in a number of ways.  The Central Bank immediately began to carry out an investigation.  As Deputies are aware, the Central Bank is the regulatory authority for banking and acts independently of Government.  The Revenue Commissioners were involved in an investigation in relation to tax fraud.  My Department wrote to the bank to seek information in relation to insurance matters for which we have responsibility.  When we received a reply, we immediately made contact with the Attorney General and sought outside legal advice which was made available to us about ten days ago.  On foot of this advice we appointed an authorised officer under the insurance Acts to carry out an investigation.  The authorised officer went into the bank last Monday.  If we succeed in getting the High Court to agree to our petition to have an inspector appointed under section 8 of the Companies Act, it will be the first time an inspector has been appointed without a preliminary investigation.  In all, it will be only the third time an inspector has been appointed under the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am determined, as I have been from the outset, to act with the best legal advice to ensure we are successful.  The customers of National Irish Bank and the people demand no less.  The Government is determined that, if there are deficiencies in the legislation which might prevent a thorough investigation and these matters getting into the public domain, we will address those issues.  The Minister for Finance will deal with the matters which affect his Department and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>While I cannot say with certainty that the court will agree to my request to appoint an inspector &mdash; the terms on which it might agree are a matter for the court &mdash; the following are the matters I would like the inspector to address.  I would like him to establish the nature and extent of the practices which came to light by National Irish Bank and which customers were involved.  I would like him to establish the role played by the bank's internal and external auditors in identifying the problem and bringing it to notice and the role, if any, played by National Irish Bank management in encouraging such surcharging practices.  I would like him to establish whether National Irish Bank management acted effectively to <Col N="256" /> terminate these practices when they came to its attention.  For instance, were staff disciplined and new control systems and procedures put in place to ensure such practices were not repeated?  I would like him to establish why the misappropriated funds were not repaid and who was responsible for this decision.  I would like him to establish the role, if any, played by the chairman, directors and members of National Irish Bank in encouraging, condoning or ignoring these practices and in supervising the activities of National Irish Bank management.</P>
    <P>We are determined to ensure the investigation does not run into the sand like two other investigations under section 8 of the Companies Act. On foot of those investigations nobody was ever prosecuted.  One investigation cost £1.2 million and the other in excess of £200,000.  In moving cautiously but with determination the Government wants to ensure we are successful.  We have to take the best legal advice to ensure we are successful.</P>
    <P>The statement from National Irish Bank will be of great assistance in helping us to have an inspector appointed.  After the Government became aware of the allegations on the 6 o'clock news &mdash; nobody in the House knew anything about the matter before then &mdash; we were in discussion with the Attorney General, the governor of the Central Bank and others on the best way to proceed.  We had to be satisfied that we had sufficient evidence to convince the court that the company was run in such a way that it might defraud creditors or any other person or that it was run in an unlawful manner.</P>
    <P>They are the circumstances under which an inspector would be appointed.  Given that National Irish Bank made a statement, it should make it easier for that inspector to be appointed. The statement reads: &ldquo;the incidents RTE referred to go back many years and do not reflect the current policies or practices of the bank&rdquo;.  National Irish Bank is clearly acknowledging that what was contained in the RTE revelations is correct.  It goes on to say that &ldquo;this practice occurred in a small number of branches and in a limited number of accounts in the late 1980s and early 1990s&rdquo;. It continues: &ldquo;We accept that customers affected by the unauthorised practice were not advised of it and were not offered recompense at that time&rdquo;. It is extraordinary that although these practices were detected seven, eight or nine years ago, it is only now that the bank will identify the customers involved and reimburse them.  That is not good enough.  It is a disgraceful response by National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>We will take questions later but if we succeed in having an inspector appointed to National Irish Bank, it will be the tenth inquiry with which I have been involved in eight months in office. That is an extraordinary indictment of the manner in which our company law has been enforced. We are determined that the laws which apply in this country are enforced fairly and evenly, regardless of who is involved.  Those who do business <Col N="257" /> in and with Ireland are entitled to expect no less.</P>
    <P>Those who put their money in the bank are entitled to expect that it is safe and to have trust and confidence in the bank.  As I said earlier, when trust and confidence in a banking institution breaks down, it is not just serious for the customers and bank involved but also for the country.  That is why the Government is taking this issue seriously.  The Cabinet meeting yesterday evening after we became aware of these facts and which lasted approximately an hour and a half was probably unprecedented.  Meetings were held with the Governor of the Central Bank and the Attorney General late into the evening.  We did that because of our concern and determination to ensure that we leave no stone unturned in bringing these matters into the public domain and in dealing with the severity which such actions justify with those responsible, whether by condoning, ignoring or encouraging them.</P>

She is a public speaker of repute and ability, but it is unacceptable and bounds on the scandalous for her to come into the House without a script.  This is one of the most important issues to occur in the banking industry.  To ad lib her way through a statement in the manner in which she has done is totally unacceptable and not part of a proper process of accountability to this House.  The Tánaiste presides over one of the major Departments.  If I, with no resources or backup, could prepare a script since the Order of Business, the Tánaiste should also have one from her Department.  I served in that Department and I know the ability of its civil servants to produce proper scripts if policy decisions are taken.  However, it is clear that the Government has been floundering since last night and is unable to act or to give clear policy directions to the relevant Departments which are then unable to provide the necessary written statements for the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>The allegations made by RTE yesterday evening about National Irish Bank were deeply disturbing.  They accuse NIB of theft and fraud.  Over a number of years NIB had an organised system in place which loaded interest on accounts of certain customers.  The loading was arbitrary, motivated by a desire to maximise NIB profits and was applied without the knowledge or agreement of its customers.  A second allegation that an arbitrary system was also in place to load bank fees on certain accounts to accumulate further profits is also disturbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> These extra fees were totally unjustified and their imposition amounts to theft and-or fraud.</P>
    <P>NIB has stated that it will repay customers the interest charges which were wrongly applied.  This amounts to an admission that the allegations made by RTE are true.  A clear <i>prima facie</i> case now exists that persons at senior level in NIB were involved in a conspiracy to defraud their customers and to steal from their accounts to increase the profitability of NIB.  In the final analysis, fraud and theft are matters for the Garda Síochána.  If the evidence now before us applied to the theft of a bicycle by a young man, the squad car would be outside his door.  I hope the general inability of the criminal justice system to deal with white collar crime will not prevail in this case and that the gardaí are given every encouragement, support and co-operation to proceed to a successful prosecution.  I also hope that whatever other action the Government proposes to take will not inhibit the gardaí or lead to further procrastination.</P>
    <P>The Government, particularly the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, dealt with the original allegations that NIB was involved in organised tax evasion in a tardy, casual and offhand manner. They did not afford the issue the seriousness it merited.  I was not surprised at the panic and ineffectiveness of the Government last night when faced with this emerging scandal.  The Minister for Finance dismissed the original allegations as matters of little consequence.  On RTE he remarked that the issue was unimportant as it applied only to a minuscule percentage of NIB's deposit accounts.  The Tánaiste failed to act until she was aware that this latest scandal was about to break.</P>
    <P>The hapless Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Treacy, appointed an inspector under the Insurance Acts to investigate a matter which was self-evident and could be established in a five minute telephone call &mdash; that National Irish Bank was in breach of European Union and domestic law when it marketed a life insurance product in this jurisdiction which was sourced in the Isle of Man, a non-EU jurisdiction.  Everyone in the banking and insurance industries knew that if they operated without a licence they were in breach of that law.  This was a codology response by the Minister of State, in consultation with the Tánaiste, to a major scandal and the Tánaiste should be ashamed of herself.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must convince this House and the public that their inability to act when the original allegations were made was due to nothing more than their inability to make decisions, to managerial incompetence and to a general layer of doziness which is the hallmark of so many Ministers in this Government.</P>
    <P>This Administration is close to National Irish Bank.  Deputy Cooper-Flynn is a former employee and had some role in the sale and marketing of the broker bond product which gave rise to the original allegations of tax evasion.  The former <Col N="259" /> chief executive of NIB, Mr. Jim Lacey, is reputed to be a close associate of the Taoiseach. I understand he is chairman of Forum 2000, the main fund raising vehicle of the Fianna Fáil Party which was set up by the Taoiseach in 1995 to target business people in each constituency to raise £3 million in three years.  Mr. Lacey was appointed by the Government as chairman of the Irish Aviation Authority and as a member of the executive board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He was also chairman of the Local Government Reorganisation Commission. I have little doubt that Mr. Lacey is well suited to these State appointments on grounds of ability and experience.  However, when the Tánaiste is going to the High Court to appoint an inspector to NIB to investigate alleged fraud at a time when Mr. Lacey was chief executive, would it not be appropriate for the Taoiseach to ask Mr. Lacey to step aside from these State appointments while the Tánaiste's inspector is carrying out his investigations?</P>
    <P>It has been publicly stated, and not denied, that NIB is the main banker of the Progressive Democrats. An overdraft figure of £300,000 has been mentioned in the media.  I hope the Tánaiste has requested her party trustees to establish that no interest loading or excessive fees applied to the accounts of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any of these personal friendships or business relationships with NIB has led the Government or any Minister to act improperly in this affair.  There is a general inability in Cabinet to take resolute action, but it must be taken now.  The Tánaiste, who has failed to do that, and the Minister for Finance must make it absolutely clear that resolute action will be taken.</P>
    <P>I suggest the following programme of action. The investigation into allegations of tax evasion being made by the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Tánaiste's insurance investigator must be brought to a conclusion immediately.  The reports must be brought before the House, debated in full and their recommendations implemented.  The Garda should be encouraged to investigate the latest scandal and any other action taken by the Government should not be used as an excuse to delay a Garda inquiry. The Tánaiste should proceed, as she stated she would to the High Court, to put an inspector in place, with the consent of the High Court, at the earliest possible date.  We do not need her to read out terms of reference.  The function of the inspector is to investigate the allegations of fraud under the insurance Acts and to make recommendations. The Minister for Finance should request all internal audit reports from NIB and report to the House on how widespread was the practice of interest loading.  The Minister for Finance should appoint an outside firm of auditors to examine all relevant NIB accounts to make recommendations on the amounts that should be repaid to NIB customers and those amounts <Col N="260" /> should include interest and compensation payments. NIB now lacks the credibility to carry out this work and a helpline service should be organised for aggrieved customers.  All costs of latter two proposals should be borne not by the Exchequer but by National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs should take whatever steps he is empowered to take to establish if fraudulent practices, similar to those in NIB, were carried out in other banks.  I have no evidence that such practices were common or in place in other banks, but the suggestion is being widely made this morning, privately and publicly, principally by bank customers.  Credibility in the banking system must be restored.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance has an adequate portfolio of powers through the Central Bank to restore such credibility and to allay the fears of the public.  I recommend the Minister for Finance should set up an independent banking inspectorate answerable to the Central Bank which would visit and examine on a random basis any branch, Department or section of a bank to investigate all its proceedings and report on them to the Central Bank.  Unless there is an inspectorate in place which can thoroughly examine the proceedings of any branch, section or department of a bank on a random basis, credibility will not be restored in the Irish banking system.  The Central Bank should be made accountable to Dáil Éireann in respect of its regulatory and supervisory powers in relation to banks.  Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.  I have heard the Minister for Finance say here on at least two occasions that the Central Bank will investigate and report to him but he is bound by reasons of confidentiality not to reveal the contents of its report and not to share its recommendations with us.  That is not acceptable.  The primary role of the Central Bank will shortly pass to the new European Bank in Frankfurt.  Its main role from now on will be a regulatory function in respect of the financial industry and the banking sector in particular.  There must be accountability to the people through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister decides he needs to legislate to put that accountability in place this side of the House will support him.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank must immediately inspect the computer software systems of all banks by which interest and fees are applied.  If there is fraud in other banks we can take it for granted it is done by rigging the software.  Customers' transactions are run through the computer and the software will dictate what fees or interest they are charged on particular transactions and types of accounts.  The Central Bank must immediately give an assurance that everything in regard to software is in accordance with law and best practice and subject the systems to subsequent random inspection.  That is absolutely vital as all our wages, salaries, overdrafts and deposits will be transferred into Euro shortly.</P>
    <P>This scandal goes to the heart of the banking system.  If it is not dealt with in an upright and <Col N="261" /> resolute manner by the Government it will damage our economic prospects.  Fine Gael will support any action the Government is willing to take to restore credibility to the banking system and get to the bottom of this scandal.</P>

      <P>I will try not to repeat what my colleague Deputy Noonan said other than to say the information RTE disclosed last night is profoundly damaging not only to the National Irish Bank but to customers' credibility in our banking system.  I reiterate what Deputy Noonan said.  It is important that the Taoiseach or one of the Ministers should clarify the position of former Chief Executive of the National Irish Bank, Mr. Jim Lacey, and his continuance in the public positions he holds.  Section 10 of the Companies Act clearly allows an inspector once appointed to interview anybody or persons relevant to the investigation irrespective of whether they are officers of the company being investigated.  The inspector will have to investigate the actions of the former chief executive and others.  It is doubly extraordinary that in the early 1990s the chief executive wrote a letter to his staff telling them that the practice of skimming people's accounts for fraudulent reasons must stop immediately, but that did not seem to happen.  His instructions were not taken up immediately and questions must be asked about why his authority did not rule.</P>
      <P>I regret to say this is another element of the Tánaiste's unsteady handling of a number of issues since she took office.  I refer to the Seagate affair when she said she knew nothing about its closure, her tardiness in setting up an inquiry into the Ryanair matter and the fact that in January this same bank came up for questioning over using insurance bonds as a tax evasion measure. I call on the Tánaiste to ensure that when she gets power from the courts to appoint an inspector she will include in that inspector's remit an investigation into the use of insurance bonds as a tax evasion measure.  That is something she should have done last January when this story broke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to overstate the importance of the revelations made yesterday evening by RTE.  It is probably fair to say that most people believe bank charges are too high and it is certainly fair to say that most people, myself included, believe bank interest is too high. However, few of us would have suspected that one of the big four banks would have set out systematically to defraud its customers.  The banking system is built on trust and confidence.  Customers lodge their money in banks because they have confidence in the system.  They may have a particular choice because they have been offered a good deal or they may get on well with a particular bank manager, but the bottom line is they have confidence in the system managing their money.  They believe that when they lodge money they will be able to withdraw it whenever they want to.  They believe in the system.  Without that trust in the system it cannot work.</P>
      <P>By engaging in improper activities, which were almost certainly illegal, National Irish Bank has posed a serious threat to public confidence in the banking system.  It is not difficult to imagine the reaction of ordinary bank customers yesterday evening when they saw the report on RTE.  The truth of the matter is very few of us pay much attention to our bank statements.  We do not scrutinise them carefully, most of us do not have the wherewithal to do so and some of the charging arrangements are so complex that ordinary people would find it difficult to do it anyway.</P>
      <P>For example, bank interest is charged on a daily basis.  Few customers, if any, are in a position to assess whether they have been charged the correct rate of interest.  We rely on and trust the bank to get it right and NIB has betrayed that trust through its actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to find out what happened.  RTE has evidence that malpractice occurred in at least four branches of the bank &mdash; Carndonagh, Walkinstown, Cork and Carrick-on-Shannon.  It relates to the late 1980s and early 1990s but how can we be sure such practices were not more widespread and that they have now ceased?  A full and immediate investigation of the bank's activities is necessary but it must not be confined simply to the allegations made by RTE.  We must go much <Col N="263" /> further and look at the full range of activities of NIB since it commenced business under its current management in this country.</P>
    <P>The decisions to load charges on individual customers were implemented by local bank managers who were later given bonuses despite, or perhaps because of, their diligence in increasing the bank's profit margins.  Senior head office management was told what was happening.  The impression given is of a bank divided between those who wanted to make profits at all costs and those who wanted to enforce normal banking standards.  The public is entitled to know who authorised what happened, who know about these malpractices and who was ultimately responsible.  In a sense the answer to the last question is clear.  If senior management did not know what was happening, then it should have known.  There is no way out and it must take responsibility and the consequences.</P>
    <P>The statement made by NIB yesterday is amazing as it admits to gross irregularities and then goes on to state blandly &ldquo;the bank regrets this.  &rdquo; Does it seriously believe a one sentence statement of regret is an adequate response?  There is no indication the bank will make a full disclosure on what happened or even explain how it came to happen; that it will discipline those responsible for the fraud or that it has the remotest appreciation of the serious nature of what it has done. The statement is worse than that because having given a one sentence statement of regret it goes on to make an extraordinary attack on RTE for having the cheek to make the revelations initially. I am quoting from the last paragraph of the statement:</P>
    <P>RTE has again allowed itself to be used by disaffected parties to promote out of date information about the bank in a manner designed to inflict maximum damage on NIB. NIB is gravely concerned that RTE continues to present highly selective information leaked to it to undermine the bank and to misrepresent the bank's management and its staff.</P>
    <P>The effrontery of this attack is breathtaking but is entirely consistent with the approach of the bank over these last weeks.  The bank first attempted to deny what happened and then went on to organise an internal investigation with no commitment to make the results public.  It then panicked and decided to go to court to attempt to muzzle RTE.  We should reflect on this.  The bank admits to its inadequacy in its systems but then goes to court to prevent RTE from highlighting them.  It is like saying &ldquo;I admit I stole something but how dare you call me a thief?&rdquo; The Supreme Court decision is hugely important.  All of us acknowledge that confidentiality is at the heart of the banking system.  It is important that a customer should be able to deal with his or her bank in the confident knowledge that it will go no further, but it is equally important that the system is not used for illegal <Col N="264" /> or improper purposes.  The court set out to strike a balance between the public interest and that of the bank and individual customers.  In doing that, it has done a good day's work for the general public.  It is right that journalists and others should be allowed or encouraged to reveal wrongdoing wherever they find it.  We owe a debt of gratitude to RTE for the work it has done over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Extraordinary though it seems the effrontery of the bank did not even stop when it lost the court case.  It went on to issue a statement earlier this week which was presumably intended to preempt yesterday's RTE report.  These people have done nothing to earn our trust or respect.  On the contrary, the action of the bank's management at every turn smacks of cynicism of a despicable kind.</P>
    <P>I turn to the response of Government.  Issues relating to NIB have been in the public domain for eight weeks.  I was struck, as were many others, by the extraordinarily blasé response of the Minister for Finance, in particular.  The frenzied reaction of Government over the past 12 hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Efficient not frenzied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is in stark contrast to the nonchalant attitude the Minister has taken up for most of the past two months.  It is about time he started acting as a Minister rather than as an accountant who shows a quaint awareness of the practices some customers wish to carry on.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Tánaiste has done and that the right approach is to apply to court for the appointment of an inspector.  It is about time but this should have been done weeks ago.  However, it is the right way to go.  It is extraordinary that the governor of the Central Bank is meeting Mr. Spain this morning.  There were a number of opportunities in recent weeks to discuss the role of the Central Bank and I have been struck by the inadequacy of the response from the bank and the Minister for Finance in defending its role. The governor and the bank have consistently said they will look only to the prudential supervision of the banking system.  Their role, as they see it, is simply to ensure the ratios are right and the system is not about to collapse.</P>
      <P>The bank must go one step further and realise that when customers of a bank cease to trust it, the system is under threat.  Public cynicism poses the greatest potential threat to the system.  The role of the Central Bank must ensure the practices that have been revealed over the past while do not continue.  It must take a more proactive, interactive role in going into individual banks and ensuring that activities, such as tax evasion or those which have been revealed over the past 12 hours, simply do not happen.  If the bank does not currently see this as its role, then it must be told, and if necessary legislation must be amended to ensure it is given such a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential consequences for the banking <Col N="265" /> system as a whole are grave.  My office has taken a number of telephone calls from customers of other banks suggesting that activities such as these were happening in their branches also.  It has been specifically suggested that in another bank a directive was given a number of years ago that loading should be introduced in a systemised way on certain customers.  I have no way of verifying that but hope it is not true.  However, there is no doubt there is widespread distrust among the public about what is happening in the banking system which must be confronted and set aside. Mr. Fagan, the Director of Consumer Affairs, must be given authority if he does not already have it to go into banks and ensure their practices are up to best standards.  We must be assured these activities are not widespread, but if they are the information must be revealed.  The public is entitled to be told the first step is to obtain information and then take action.  There must be action against the individuals responsible in NIB for these practices and elsewhere if it is more widespread. The allegations border on, if not amount to, fraud.  They are illegal, improper activities; it is stealing.  If that is the case, the DPP and the Garda have a role and should investigate without delay.  The Government has been excessively tardy in reaction to this.  It has misread the public mood which is one of anger, cynicism and a lack of confidence in the banking system.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of Government to confront this and restore confidence.  I want to have confidence in the Government's ability to do so but nothing it has done over the past eight weeks gives me such confidence.  I hope it does better in the next while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been revealed by two RTE journalists to have transpired at NIB strikes at the basis of the trust that is the foundation of the banking system.  We do not know yet if there are grounds for believing that the practice of raiding the accounts of their customers extended to other banks.  If it is found that the practice of bank profits being swollen arising from the NIB practice of helping itself to its customers' money is replicated elsewhere then the integrity of the banking system itself is at issue.</P>
      <P>This raises the fundamental question of the actions &mdash; or rather, the failure to act &mdash; of those with political responsibility to move speedily to restore confidence in the banking system.  The performance of the Government to date, for whatever reason, has been characterised by uncertainty, prevarication, diversion and above all a determination that whatever has been going on will be kept quiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that this crisis did not suddenly blow up last night on the &ldquo;RTE News&rdquo;. The Government cannot feign shock or surprise and pretend to be taking speedy action.  This story goes back to the extraordinary revelations of 23 January by the same two journalists, Mr. Charlie Bird and Mr. George Lee, who alleged, as summarised <Col N="266" /> by the Supreme Court, that the bank knowingly facilitated the targeting of high net worth customers, including hot money, for the purposes of tax evasion.  Could there be a more serious allegation?  Is stealing on a large scale from the Exchequer acceptable but stealing from the bank's customers provokes an emergency Cabinet meeting?  These two charges are so serious that if established they raise questions about whether this bank should continue to be licensed to trade as a bank.</P>
    <P>Why did the Tánaiste not move to appoint an inspector?  Over eight weeks I have repeatedly sought to explain to the public the difference in the powers of a section 8 appointed inspector and those of an authorised officer.  For today's purposes, the main difference is that the report of an authorised officer may not be published.  An organised scheme to facilitate tax evasion is a criminal offence and does not meet the obligation of directors in terms of compliance with company law.</P>
    <P>We knew about the RTE allegations of large scale tax evasion and the lengths to which the bank went to obfuscate and conceal the truth. The bank incurred the costs &mdash; which will no doubt be passed on to its customers in due course &mdash; of going to the Supreme Court to suppress further disclosures.  The Tánaiste knew all this; why did she think the bank went to the court in the first place?  She knew RTE had made no secret of the fact that they had further, grave, reliable information concerning the conduct of the bank, yet she resisted all appeals to have an inspector appointed.  Why?  She tells us now she has to take advice concerning whether the circumstances obtaining permit her to petition the High Court to have a section 8 inspector appointed but why did she not take this advice over the last eight weeks?</P>

      <P>Is tax evasion less serious than stealing from customers' accounts?  No citizens of the State were defrauded when I was in that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of secrecy sits uneasily with the Tánaiste's honourable record as an Opposition Deputy, yet that is the common theme running through this saga since 23 January in all the inquiries, whether instituted by the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank or NIB itself &mdash; whatever the outcome of the inquiry, it must be concealed from the public.  Only this week, when the dogs in the street knew that RTE was coming back for a second time, did the Tánaiste move to appoint to NIB what RTE erroneously but understandably called an inspector.  She appointed not an inspector but rather an authorised <Col N="267" /> officer under the Insurance Act, 1989 to establish whether CMI was authorised to do business here.</P>
    <P>This is so incidental to what has occurred at NIB that if I did not know the Tánaiste to be a politician of integrity I could only conclude that this decision was a smokescreen to avoid the real issue and maintain secrecy.  Whether CMI was or was not authorised to do business in this jurisdiction &mdash; and I am puzzled as to why that is not available in the Department's records &mdash; is incidental to the main issue here, which is a bank raiding its customers' accounts and being accused of facilitating tax evasion.</P>
    <P>As Deputies Noonan and McDowell said, the Minister for Finance in his inimitable fashion pooh-poohed the RTE story of 23 January &mdash; he said the money involved was small in the context of the amount of tax collected every year.  In any other EU member state, if a Minister for Finance made that statement he would find himself allocated to other duties.  Has the Tánaiste been subjected to such arguments for not acting and hoping the Supreme Court would gag RTE?</P>
    <P>In this scandal the role of the former chief executive of NIB must be examined.  It is not sufficient to say, as he did in his letter, that &ldquo;this practice must cease for obvious reasons&rdquo;.  Why did he not ensure that the practice terminated or that the findings of the internal audit committee were implemented?  Why did he not direct that the property stolen from customers be restored to them?  Is it true, as I have been advised, that he personally drove this unquestioning culture of profit maximisation before he was relieved of his duties as chief executive officer?  The one Deputy who can answer that question has left the House, unfortunately.  I note that Mr. Lacey has powerful political connections which are entirely a matter for himself and whoever wants to associate with him but the Tánaiste should reassure the House that these known political connections played no parts in the unwillingness to date to properly investigate the RTE revelations in a manner which can be subjected to proper scrutiny in this House and the public domain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the almost unprecedented response of the Tánaiste, who came into this House without a script and ad libbed her way through a crisis which poses questions about the entire banking system, thus making it impossible for Opposition spokespersons to look at what precisely has been said.  However, she made one extraordinary statement, mentioned by neither of my colleagues &mdash; she is examining a remit for the inspector, if he is appointed by the High Court, which will have him deal with the events of last evening.</P>

      <P>In any event, to imply that there is a jurisprudence in this area since 1990 is a nonsense, it has happened on only two occasions.  If the Minister does not appoint an inspector in a case where the integrity of the banking system is at issue, when does she opt to appoint one?  The little old ladies who thought it was safe to take money out of their mattresses and put it into the bank now have serious cause for reflection.  Myles na gCopaleen said banking was the second oldest profession but more profitable than the oldest.</P>
      <P>Now we know why the profits are so high.  It is not enough that one has to pay a plethora of charges, one is subjected to the bank helping itself to one's account whenever a manager is under pressure to produce results in that particular bank branch.  That is a fundamentally serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of charges, the Consumer Credit Act, which I introduced, for the first time gives the Director of Consumer Affairs authority in respect of bank charges.  The Director of Consumer Affairs now must have the commercial justification made out to him by any bank seeking to impose a new or additional charge.  Each such application must be accompanied by a fee of £20,000.  My purpose in doing that was to deter additional charges.  I well recall the lobbying the banking industry engaged in at that time to kill that particular change in the Bill.  I am glad it is <Col N="269" /> now law.  In the context of the euro it will be especially effective.  The £20,000 contributes revenue to the Director of Consumer Affairs to enable him to ensure he has the technology and staffing available to him to supervise the question of bank charges.  In a low inflation environment, where banks cannot make the kind of killing on interest rates they made previously, they are more reliant than ever on bank charges of one kind or another.  Therefore, this particular power to the Director of Consumer Affairs ought to be examined in terms of its efficacy. If it needs to be strengthened that should be done and the Government should give support speedily to that area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste also to tell us what she knows about the situation in the other banks.  I am advised that this procedure of loading of interest charges was not unusual in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Another associated bank apparently categorised their customers in categories of one to five.  Category three accounts, which were generally regarded as troublesome or time consuming, were singled out and were the subject of loading of up to 3 per cent.  We need to examine if there is any basis for that claim.</P>
    <P>I am advised also that a different associated bank operates the practice known as &ldquo;shadow permissioning&rdquo;.  I will explain that to the Tánaiste so that she will be enabled to respond to it without a script.  If a person gets permission to run up an overdraft of, say, £1,000 he or she is given, but not told of, shadow permission for an overdraft of up to £2,000.  If that person goes over the £1,000 limit the cheque will be honoured but the balance between £1,000 and £2,000 will be loaded through extra interest and charges.  That allegation has to be investigated to see if there is basis for it.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical of the Tánaiste personally &mdash; I know she has many responsibilities &mdash; but the RTE story of 23 January is mind-boggling. Why was action not taken?  The Tánaiste knew RTE would come back with more allegations. Why were the pieces not put in place to petition the High Court over that period?  The Tánaiste knew well that RTE did not go to the High Court and the Supreme Court because it had shot its bolt, so to speak.  She knew there was more coming.  We still do not know, except what the bank tells us, about the scale of this matter.  I do not know why the Tánaiste should pick Carndonagh, Carrick-on-Shannon, etc.  As I understand it, managers are now regarded as profit centres in their own right, they are required to perform and the relentless drive for profit maximisation produces this kind of pressure.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that the regulatory authority is only now wakening up to a scam like this. The Central Bank has a responsibility.  How did it not know there was organised tax evasion and that this latest scam was going on?  I am concerned about that and it ought to be dealt with in the contribution from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>On 3 March my colleague, Deputy Gormley, asked a question of the Minister for Finance as to whether any consideration was being given by the Government to the establishment of a commission on banking.  Sadly, the Minister was not satisfied that such a commission was necessary.  I wonder if the Government is still of that opinion as it scans the illegal practices of National Irish Bank now being revealed on almost a daily basis.  The Green Party considers that a commission on banking has been necessary for some time.  Recent revelations regarding National Irish Bank have merely entrenched us in that position.</P>
      <P>The still unanswered scandal of offshore banking being used for tax evasion purposes has now been added to by the revelations that the bank has engaged in hidden charges and underpayments of interests.  We should be grateful to RTE for making this information available and wonder whether such information would have been made available by the Department of Finance or by the Central Bank.  We can now that the protracted court actions involving National Irish Bank and RTE had little to do with the spurious reasoning of protecting customer confidentiality and everything to do with ensuring this information was never made public.</P>
      <P>The questions that now need to be asked are: what was known, by which Government Department, when, what action was taken and what action is it intended now to take?  These are questions that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have to answer in a credible manner.  Other members of the Government need to ask questions of themselves and eventually they may be required to answer questions in this House.</P>
      <P>National Irish Bank, as an institution and as a grouping of individuals who make up its decision making body, is not unknown to this Government, as already mentioned.  Prominent individuals in this bank have been closely identified as key supporters and providers of resources to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We now know that the Progressive Democrats also bank with National Irish Bank.  So close have such relationships been that the Taoiseach can claim to have close personal knowledge of the key individuals who have been involved with National Irish Bank.  The fact that such individuals have been appointed to boards of State agencies seems to indicate that confidence existed in their abilities and the performance of the agencies with which they have been associated.  Those who have made these decisions now need, at the very least, to have their judgment questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious question that needs to be answered immediately is whether donations were made to political parties or individual politicians by National Irish Bank and, if so, should such <Col N="271" /> donations not be made public and perhaps returned given that we now know about the activities of National Irish Bank?  It should be self-evident by now that there is a need to appoint, through the High Court, an inspector with the strongest possible powers to investigate the activities of National Irish Bank.  Failure to do anything else would indicate that the Government, as well as NIB, have something to hide.</P>
    <P>Returning to the wider issues to which this controversy gives rise, there is also a need to investigate whether any such dubious banking practices are in any other financial institutions in the country.  The need to discover whether NIB represented the exception rather than the rule is something a commission on banking could legitimately and effectively determine.</P>
    <P>We need to address the philosophy that underlines Irish banking as well as the conduct of the Central Bank on this issue.  The clumsy approach adopted by the Minister for Finance in relation to credit unions in the recent Finance Bill seems to indicate an attitude that all financial institutions have a single-minded approach to the creation of money whereas responsibility, if it exists at all, is rarely directed to the good of society in general.</P>
    <P>The issues that now need to be addressed represent a catalogue of tax evasion, hidden charges and non-payment of charges which can be added to the list bank customers have long held as part and parcel of a system which does little to assist, inform or benefit.  The inexplicable language of banking needs to be reinterpreted.  The activities of all financial institutions should be standardised in terms of charges.  Banking legislation, as well as legislation on data and consumer protection, needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The veil of secrecy sorely needs to be lifted. However, whether a Government that has been willing to hide behind that veil is able to bring about that openness is strongly open to question. Other mechanisms must be put in place.  There is a need to establish an office of financial ombudsman, which would be independent of the banking and insurance industries.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, natural and necessary for the Government to exercise a close monitoring role on national and international monetary systems. It is now clear the banking system has not been accountable.  In the short term, the Minister and the Government must ensure this investigation into theft and tax evasion is conducted clearly and thoroughly and whatever crime is revealed must not escape unpunished, as happened with white collar crime.  However, the Government must focus in the longer term on banking systems which concentrate on community development and which avoid complex and exorbitant charges. Such banks must be supported and learned from. I cite in that regard the LETS, the Local Exchange Trading Systems, which must be given credibility and support in the longer term as an <Col N="272" /> important means of benefiting the unemployed and low waged and developing the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The extraordinary revelations of what took place in National Irish Bank branches puts a whole new construction on the concept of bank robbery.  Our image of bank robbers has been of violent men in balaclavas with guns in one hand and swag bags in the other; it must now include sober suited bank executives with fountain pens in one hand and altered balance sheets in the other.</P>
      <P>Of all the recent scandals in our society, it must mark a new low in the workings of the present system when a pillar of the economic capitalist establishment in this State indulges in blatant and blind robbery of unsuspecting citizens, most of whom are undoubtedly on incomes substantially lower than those enjoyed by National Irish Bank executives.  If the fourth largest bank in this State acts in this way, it begs the question whether other banks have indulged in similar practices. Will the Government tell us what measures it will take to see if that is the case?</P>
      <P>Devastating as these revelations are on first hearing, on second thoughts perhaps it is not so surprising because the banking system generally has been guilty of overweening arrogance in the way it has imposed charges on customers, quite legally apparently, for many years.  I equate the charging system of the banking establishment to the taxation raising powers of the State.</P>
      <P>The banks have been encouraged in this by the failure of successive Governments to challenge them in their lust for super profits.  Indeed, the banks have been consistently encouraged by successive Governments in the kinds of tax breaks and other incentives they have been allowed to offer.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the two largest banks had profits approaching £1 billion in the past 12 months?  Look how successive Governments have treated the income of ordinary workers in comparison with the banks.  Ordinary workers have had their wage increases hammered to only 1 per cent per annum in real terms over the past ten years.  In the 12 months to September 1997, National Irish Bank had a massive 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to £25.5 million &mdash; no restraint there.</P>
      <P>Other questions must be asked.  The largest banks in this State have said at their annual meetings in the past few years that they have made substantial financial donations to the major political parties represented in this House.  If National Irish Bank has made donations to any political parties they should be declared in this debate and, as Deputy Sargent said, returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks are now very much a part of the economic structure of this society and they carry massive power, which is exercised by unelected boards and faceless men and women.  I call for the public ownership of the banking system, which should be run for social aims and the benefit of ordinary people and not to bloat the profits of a few individuals, <Col N="273" /> which gives rise to scandals such as we have just seen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the recent serious allegations concerning certain practices in National Irish Bank.  It is also concerned that bank customers should be able to rely on the fact that the charges levied by their bank, whether these charges are made up of interest or fees, are no higher than the standard charges which that bank applies to that particular type of account. Customers have a right to expect that higher charges will not be imposed without their knowledge. Customers also have a right to expect that where genuine errors are made by their bank, corrective action is taken as soon as possible after the error comes to light.  These are basic minimum standards which every customer is entitled to expect their bank to abide by.</P>
      <P>The information available to the Government in relation to these allegations is no greater than that in the public domain.  The allegations being made relate to transactions which took place a number of years ago.  These transactions predate important legislation on consumer protection, notably the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, and the introduction of greater transparency in relation to bank charges.  I have no reason to believe the alleged practices have taken place within this new regulatory environment.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, the Central Bank of Ireland is the supervisory authority in Ireland in relation to banks.  The Central Bank has available to it a modern legal framework to support its supervisory activities.  This statutory framework is based on EU legislation for the most part and it is, therefore, up to best international practice.  As Minister for Finance, I have been assured by the Governor of the Central Bank that he is satisfied the regulatory powers available to him are generally adequate to enable him to discharge his regulatory duties in a satisfactory manner.  He has also assured me the bank is in a position to implement these supervisory duties in the way it is required to do by law.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Governor has already completed an investigation into earlier allegations concerning National Irish Bank.  He wrote to me confirming this on 19 March 1998, and confirming again the general satisfaction of the board of the bank with the legal framework for bank supervision.  I will now read this letter to the House:</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of 26 January requesting a report on the implications, if any, for all aspects of banking supervision of the allegations made against National Irish Bank.  I can confirm your understanding that the Central Bank officers who inspected National Irish Bank were acting solely as banking supervisors. Their report is completed.  I am precluded by law from informing any third party of the outcome of their inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to you on 11 November last at some <Col N="274" /> length about supervisory issues arising from the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments).  In my letter, l confirmed to you that the board was satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge satisfactorily its statutory functions.  I also told you that the board keeps supervisory procedures and practices under review, and tries to ensure that these are in line with best international practice.  I elaborated both on the statutory and procedural questions and I will not repeat the detail here.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Bank's recent inquiries into National Irish Bank leads me to change any of the conclusions which I reported last November. The Bank's powers governing inspections are extensive.  More generally, both legal requirements and procedures are adequate to deal with the issues involved.  I do not see, at present, any need to change legislation dealing with banking supervision, other than in the detail I mentioned in my November letter.</P>
    <P>There is a general point about the legislative framework touching on the area covered by the NIB allegations that I would like to bring to your attention.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, introduced new obligations covering money laundering, both for the Central Bank and for most financial institutions, including all credit institutions, from May 1995.</P>
    <P>Credit institutions are obliged to report any suspicion of money laundering (including that arising from tax evasion) on the part of their clients to the Garda authorities.  Banks have in place detailed and extensive procedures and guidance rules, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure proper client identification.  They have also appointed compliance officers and a large number of reports have been sent to the Garda.  We do not know what number of these might relate to taxation.  For our part, the Central Bank has to report to the Gardai suspicions of money laundering by the financial institutions we supervise. So far we have not had cause to file a report.  We have monitored consistently the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act in financial institutions, both in meetings and in inspections, over the last three years.  I can report that institutions across the board now seriously address the issue of money laundering.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the Moriarty Tribunal has been requested to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally. The Bank looks forward to continued co-operation with the Tribunal in this matter. We have already made a lengthy submission on supervisory matters generally to the Tribunal. We welcome the prospect of expanding on our submission and clarifying any issues arising, as the Tribunal may see fit.</P>
    <P>I am aware of some concern that the conditions <Col N="275" /> of confidentiality imposed on us in relation to our supervisory duties allow the Central Bank to disclose findings only in a very limited range of circumstances.  Obviously, in such a well publicised case as that of National Irish Bank, public questioning of the position arises again.  However, you are fully aware of the rationale for the current position and the fact that it reflects faithfully our EU obligations. I have dealt with this extensively in correspondence with you and in information furnished to Oireachtas Committees.  I told the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service recently that these requirements derive from and are consistent with European Union laws.  Other banking supervisors in the European Union are subject to similar confidentiality requirements.  Our situation is in no sense unique.  If the Irish authorities attempted to abandon these requirements, not only would we be in breach of EU law but we would forfeit the co-operation of other supervisors in exchanging information.  This exchange of information is vital.  Without it, we simply could not operate as a competent supervisory authority and operations by Irish banks abroad would be called into question'.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Governor's reference to changes in some of the details in the current legislation, this relates to amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, and these are being addressed in the draft Investor Compensation Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the latest allegations concerning National Irish Bank, I have been informed by the Governor of the Central Bank that he has decided to raise these further allegations concerning National Irish Bank with the chairman of that bank today.  I have also been informed by the Governor that he intends to ask RTE to make available to the Central Bank all the information which it has at its disposal in relation to these allegations concerning National Irish Bank.  I strongly urge both National Irish Bank and RTE to co-operate fully with the Governor in his efforts to establish the facts of this case.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Central Bank as regulator of the banking system be in a position to quickly establish the facts of a case and for National Irish Bank to make these available to the public.  It is particularly important that National Irish Bank establish what amounts were overcharged to its customers and notify the customers of the amounts involved and how it proposes to make good the loss.  It is essential that the bank clear as soon as possible how it is going to approach this task and when it expects to be able to inform customers of the outcome of its investigation.  I expect the bank to give this task the highest priority.</P>
    <P>Turning to a more general approach to the question of consumer confidence, I impress upon the banking sector that it is in its own best interest to increase, to the maximum possible <Col N="276" /> extent, transparency in relation to charges of all kinds.  I am sure that everyone in the banking sector would agree that as we enter the more competitive world of EMU it is essential that customers are satisfied with the service being provided to them by the domestic banking sector. In the same way it goes without saying that customers must be able to have confidence in the standards of service provided by their banks at all times.  I would, therefore, urge the banking industry in general to make a special effort to ensure that the customers fully understand their system of charges and interest so that they can be confident that they will be informed whenever charges are levied by the bank or whenever charges are varied.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence whatever that any other bank or credit institution has engaged in the practices which are alleged to have taken place in National Irish Bank.  It is also important to keep in mind that it has not been established that the alleged practices took place outside a limited area of National Irish Bank.  It is essential that in our debate today we do not make allegations for which there is no evidence and which could damage the banking system.  The Government is determined to establish the facts and to act only on the basis of facts.  That is why it has asked the Director of Consumer Affairs to examine the implications of the allegations being made for the protection of bank customers, particularly in the area of bank charges.</P>
    <P>The Irish banking system has always been considered to have good systems of internal control and external audit.  It would appear from the reports in the public domain that they worked in this case.  They worked in the sense that the first line of defence so to speak, internal audit, identified these issues but the corrective action seems to have fallen well short of what was required in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The boards and managements of banks have a serious responsibility to satisfy themselves that there is a clear understanding at all levels within their organisations that rules and procedures and good practice must be followed and that in circumstances where it is discovered that these have not been adhered to, whether inadvertently or otherwise, corrective action is taken immediately, and that any loss to customers is made good at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government appreciates that bank customers are anxious for reassurance about the current state of affairs.  We are anxious to do what we can to give that reassurance.  I would again emphasise the considerable strengthening of the legal framework for consumer protection over recent years and the more recent extension of the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs to cover bank charges other than interest.  Notwithstanding these advances, as I have earlier indicated, the Government has specifically asked the <Col N="277" /> Director of Consumer Affairs to examine the implications of the alleged wrongdoing in this case for the general issue of the protection of bank customers, particularly in the area of bank charges.  I stress that we see this as a preliminary step and, if the conclusions reached by the Director of Consumer Affairs suggests a need to further strengthen existing arrangements, the necessary changes will be considered by Government as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The section 8 procedure is an exceptional procedure and has been used on only two previous occasions.  In using the procedure it is necessary to convince the court that there is evidence to suggest wrongdoing.  It is not good enough for somebody else to have the evidence. Until National Irish Bank issued a statement last night confirming that what RTE had alleged was correct we were still in a difficulty as to whether or not we could succeed in having an inspector appointed.  We would have been seeking, and have sought, from RTE the information at its disposal because we have to get all the information we can before we can convince the court.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want is to be rebuffed by the court.  When Deputy Quinn, as Minister, went to the High Court to have an authorised officer from the Department appointed as an inspector, he did not succeed; the court felt that some other person should be appointed.</P>

      <P>Including that.  I want to make the strongest case and I want to win.  I became aware that RTE had another story along these lines some time between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. yesterday, although I did not know the details.  When the insurance issue broke at the end of January, our legal advice was that we could not proceed with somebody else's information, that we had to have it.  We wrote to the bank and it responded a couple of days later.  Then we made contact with the Attorney General, and we got outside legal advice in relation to the matter.  That advice became available on 10 March.  I do not want to prejudice the present case by outlining the details of that advice.  However, it is not dissimilar from the advice Deputy Rabbitte received when he decided not to seek an inspector in relation to the Clonmannon village issue.  Deputy Rabbitte went on about old ladies &mdash; old ladies and old men were abused in that case.  We did not seek the appointment of an inspector because we received the same kind of advice to the effect that we probably would not succeed.  It would be a great PR stunt for me to go to court and to be rebuffed.</P>

It further succeeded in getting the court to adjourn the hearing of the case. It was only when our affidavits were produced that the action could be proceeded with.  So I have to tread carefully.  I want a thorough examination, and it has to be based on sound legal advice.  I was in my Department until close to 2 a.m. this morning.  I was in RTÉ early this morning and I was in touch with people very early this morning.  I apologise for not having a script, but when I left this House I was, again, in touch with the officials.

      <P>The Minister for Finance seems to be focusing essentially on two different levels of investigation, both of which carry major difficulties. He refers to the role of the Central Bank in investigating National Irish Bank.  It is right that he should do that.  The Governor of the Central Bank has made it very clear in recent weeks that he sees the role of the Central Bank as being to regulate the sector to ensure that the system works.  He is not approaching this from the point of view of individual customers but from the point of view of the safety of the system, to ensure that individual banks do not collapse.

      <P>The Minister says it is important that the Central Bank as regulator of the system should be in a position to quickly establish the facts in the case and for National Irish Bank to make these available to the public. Surely it is an essential difficulty that we are relying on National Irish Bank to make the facts public &mdash; the Central Bank cannot.  That must be a real problem because, from what we have seen of National Irish Bank in the past few weeks, we can have little faith in its willingness to do so.  Am I right in thinking that the Director of Consumer Affairs does not have the power to go back before 1986 or to look at bank interest as opposed to bank charges?  If the answer to both those questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, as I suspect it is, clearly he will be seriously constrained in what he can do.</P>

      <P>The last part of the question <Col N="280" /> relating to the Director of Consumer Affairs is obviously addressed to me as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We are seeking legal advice in relation to that matter.  At the moment it is uncertain whether he can investigate events prior to when he got his powers in 1996.  When we have that legal advice I will make it available to the Deputy.  If he does not have such powers, we will seek to give them to him if we can legally do that.</P>

      <P>I have read into the record my correspondence with the Governor of the Central Bank and his response to me some time ago on the adequacy of his powers.  Deputy McDowell availed of an opportunity at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to question the Governor of the Central Bank further on those and related matters.  The role of the Central Bank is the same as in other EU countries.  Its job is to regulate and supervise institutions under its control.  However, no matter what regulatory authorities exist, and no matter what laws and rules there are, we can never guard against conspiracy to defraud people.  It would appear from what RTE alleged last night that there was a concerted attempt by some people within National Irish Bank to defraud people.  When people go to such extremes it is very difficult for any regulatory authority to tap into it.  I have said in my reply and in previous replies at Question Time what the views of the Governor of the Central Bank are.  Irish Central Bank legislation conforms with best practice in Europe in this regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that it is not helpful to spread confusion about the complex area of company law?  There is no comparison with Clonmannon.  Is it not the case that I put in an authorised officer, that I used a section of the Act for the first time to intrude into the private affairs of a company, that the company was liquidated and that what was involved was a small-time crook running a retirement village?  It has no bearing, good, bad or indifferent on the present situation.  The advice to me, which the Tánaiste will find on file, and with which I agreed, was that there was nothing an inspector could establish that the very efficient authorised officer <Col N="281" /> had not established.  Did the Tánaiste not think, after the story on 23 January, that something was rotten in National Irish Bank?  Did she not consider the Charlie Bird-George Lee story concerning organised tax evasion to be of sufficient seriousness to warrant her taking action?  Can she explain why she took no action?  Was the matter considered by Government?  Did the Tánaiste discuss the matter with the Taoiseach or with the Minister for Finance?  Will she unequivocally put on the record the answer to the question I raised in my formal contribution, which Deputy Owen put, and to which she did not give a reply?</P>

Is the Minister for Finance suggesting that the people from the Central Bank who investigated the allegations of tax evasion did not read the internal audit reports?  This is the inference of the Minister's statement.  If representatives from the Central Bank investigated allegations of tax evasion without reading <Col N="284" /> the internal audit reports, their investigation is worth nothing.</P>

The Central Bank is not investigating tax matters; it is investigating exchange control matters as a result of the allegations made some months ago.</P>
      <P>I and the Governor of the Central Bank have pointed out previously that the definition of money laundering includes tax evasion.

      <P>As I pointed out previously, if matters are discovered by officers in the course of the supervisory role of the Central Bank of Ireland in relation to financial institutions, the bank is precluded under legislation from telling anybody about them.  This was made clear by the Governor of the Central Bank in reply to questions at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I also made it clear in the House on this and other occasions.</P>
      <P>I first learned about the new allegations during the division yesterday afternoon in the House on the Amsterdam Treaty legislation.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance called to Leinster House and I met him outside the Chamber.  He told me he understood that more allegations concerning National Irish Bank would be made on the RTE 6 p.m. news.  That was the first I knew about it.</P>
      <P>I met the Governor of the Central Bank last night, together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the matter was discussed further.  As I said, the Governor of the Central Bank is due to meet the chairman of National Irish Bank today to discuss these allegations and to consider his role in that regard.</P>
      <P>I wish to make clear, to avoid misapprehension in the House, the role of the Central Bank relating to financial institutions and its role in relation to the Department of Finance and the Minister. This matter has been discussed in detail during replies to many parliamentary questions from Deputy McDowell and others.  Banking is built on trust and confidence.  People must have trust and confidence in the system.  It is obvious in the case of National Irish Bank that the trust and confidence of customers has been totally misplaced. Action must be taken by the Government for the common good.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister for Finance satisfied with the procedures followed by the Central Bank inspectorate to date, given that it appears from his statement that a problem has not yet been found with the bank?  Has the inspectorate ever found wrongdoing in its investigations?  That would be of interest to this investigation.  In what way is the Central Bank accountable to the Dáil and the people?  Does the Minister agree changes are necessary to make it properly accountable and to ensure this investigation is successful?</P>

      <P>As I stated earlier, the Central Bank has extensive investigation powers in its supervisory role and it carries them out on a daily basis.  I have relied on the report submitted to me by the Governor of the Central Bank on this matter. Arising from the McCracken Tribunal report, I raised the question of the adequacy of the supervisory and regulatory powers with the Governor some months ago.  I read his reply into the record in reply to a parliamentary question at that time and I read a further reply into the record today.  The Governor has assured me &mdash; I am satisfied with his assurance &mdash; that the regulatory powers of the Central Bank are adequate and conform with best international practice.  I am satisfied in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked if the inspectorate ever found wrongdoing in its investigations.  In the law of probability, I am sure it has, but the Central Bank is precluded in law from reporting its findings to anybody.  That is the position under Central Bank Acts here and in other countries. However, evidence of money laundering can be reported to the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's final question related to the Central Bank's accountability to the Dáil.  The Central Bank Bill, which I recently brought before the House, related mainly to the compatibility of Irish legislation with economic and monetary union.  However, I included a section that will make it possible to bring the Governor of the Central Bank before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  The Governor appeared before that committee of his own volition some time ago but he is limited in what he may tell the Minister for Finance or the committee because he is precluded by law from relating his findings to others.</P>

      <P>I want a simple yes or no answer to a question I will put to the Tánaiste.  Is she saying to the House that she will not put before the courts the tax evasion scam operated by the NIB because she has not yet established who is directly responsible?  In seeking the appointment of an inspector, will she put the matter before the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the Irish regulatory procedures carried out by the Central Bank are in accordance with best practice.  He stated it would appear from reports in the public domain that the control and audit systems of the banks worked in this case.  How can he say that when <Col N="287" /> this scam occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s and is only now coming to the attention of the public?  Presumably the Central Bank was responsible for examining the internal audits of the banks concerned, but no steps were taken to force the NIB to refund the money taken out of customers' accounts.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to undertake an investigation into the other banks operating in the State to find out if similar scams have operated or continue to operate in them?  Does he intend to ask Mr. Jim Lacey to step aside from his positions on various State bodies, at least until the investigations have been completed?  That would at least establish that the Government is not constrained by other considerations in regard to Mr. Lacey.  He should be asked to step aside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>I stated earlier that the Irish banking system, like other banking systems, has control over its internal and external audits and that it would appear from the allegations in last night's news programmes that the internal audit system worked because these matters were brought to the attention of the bank on foot of that system.  However, the follow-up procedures seem to have broken down.  The Deputy may not be aware that in large organisations, banking and otherwise, external auditors rely heavily on the internal audit and control procedures.  That is what happens in all institutions.</P>

      <P>Under the money laundering legislation &mdash; tax evasion is regarded as money laundering &mdash; that can be reported to the Garda. In reply to parliamentary questions I have dealt with this point at some length.  The Deputy asked about any proposals I might have to inquire into other banks.  I have no evidence that these practices have taken place in any of the other banks. These allegations relate to National Irish Bank. It would not be correct or proper to give the impression that, in the absence of specific evidence, other financial institutions have been involved in this type of activity.  If in the future such activities come to light, the Government will consider the matter further.</P>

      <Col N="288" /> The Deputy referred to Mr. Jim Lacey.  So far as I am aware Mr. Lacey has been the chairman of a Fianna Fáil organisation, Forum 2000, for the past three years since its foundation.  This is an unpaid position and it has meetings approximately once a month.  Members pay an annual subscription and in return attend business events which attract a number of non-party keynote speakers.  I have attended a number of these events in the past three or four years.  Some of those who have attended and spoken have no connections with the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy De Rossa, subject to legal advice everything will be included in the investigation.  In relation to the insurance products which were being promoted it is uncertain as to where the blame lies, whether with the promoter or those who availed of the products being promoted.  When this issue came into the public domain we took legal advice from the Department.  The advice was that in the interests of natural justice we should write to the bank since we did not have in our possession the information and give it an opportunity to respond to questions.  We did that within two days and it responded a number of days later.  On receipt of the response we took further legal advice.  That legal advice suggested two courses of action &mdash; either that we write again to the bank or appoint <Col N="289" /> an authorised officer since we needed more information. It also stated that if we wrote again to the bank and it responded it could not incriminate itself and, therefore, it could prejudice a future case.  Therefore, it was decided not to write to it again but to appoint the authorised officer. We were further advised that, if one goes to a court without having first exhausted other channels, section 8 is a procedure of last resort.  If one goes to the court in the first instance in relation to these matters the court may well say the correct procedures were not followed.  Clearly, the bank would argue and would probably propose a section 8 investigation &mdash; and may still do so.  It would argue that it is prepared to co-operate because it kept telling us so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to Clonmannon as a holiday village.  Clonmannon is a retirement home.  It took 18 months from the time it came into the public domain that old people were being abused and six Seanad debates before the then Minister appointed an authorised officer.

      <P>It is a matter of the gravest concern for anybody dealing with a financial institution that incorrect charges are made to their accounts without their knowledge.  I certainly look at my bank statements more diligently than some people because they have always been in the red.  I have never taken too much trouble to look at interest or other charges and I am sure that could be said for 99.9 per cent of people because I assume it is done correctly.  It is a matter of the gravest concern that a financial institution should abuse that trust.  I am not saying that on bank statements errors are not made on both sides.  That a financial institution would deliberately defraud customers is very serious.  I have no doubt the Central Bank will take those <Col N="290" /> matters into consideration in its deliberations and what it must do regarding this institution.  I have every confidence it will act expeditiously and correctly. As my colleague has said in another context all facts will have to be on the table.  It is necessary that these allegations be thoroughly investigated and that we do not make precipitative decisions.

Does the Minister recognise that the Central Bank's operations continue to be shrouded in secrecy and are, in effect, protecting those who are involved on the one hand in the systematic evasion of tax and on the other in ripping off bank customers, as was so dramatically revealed by RTÉ?

Is that a fair summary of her responses today?  Since 23 January, therefore, she has not discussed the allegations of tax evasion with her relevant Government colleagues.  Did she ask RTE to supply her with information?</P>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste seriously of the opinion that, irrespective of the mechanism used to siphon funds nominally offshore to evade tax, it might not be included in the remit of the inspector?  Is she also serious when she informs the House that nothing can be done about residents of this jurisdiction who utilise a mechanism which is devised to enable them to evade tax, provided the mechanism is located outside this jurisdiction?</P>

The vast majority of people whether they are taxpayers or business people, who are also taxpayers, are honest and do not engage in practices of this nature. If this practice were to occur in other institutions, the majority of them would discipline the people involved.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs can carry out an inquiry into bank charges under section 4 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  The Act is confusing in that one part provides that the director's functions apply only to bank charges while another part, on which we are seeking legal advice following Deputy McDowell's question earlier, provides that he may carry out investigations into any practices where he believes that such investigations are proper.  I must clarify if the director can also carry out investigations into interest charges.</P>
      <P>I am personally not aware of any donations to the Progressive Democrats from National Irish Bank.  It is true the party banks with the National Irish Bank and that it has an overdraft from the bank.  It is also true that our party pays the highest possible charges on that overdraft.</P>

      <P>It is true that many bank funds went astray over the years and that they were not always properly investigated.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as we can ensure the issue is investigated in a general way by the Director of Consumer Affairs, that is the intention.  Many people probably believe that every bank has been engaged in these practices.  Many of us also believe, from time to time, that the banks act unfairly.  After all, they cannot be described as popular institutions.  Nevertheless, it is important for confidence in the economy and for the confidence that customers should and must have in their banks that there be a thorough investigation. That is the intention.</P>
      <P>If possible, and subject to legal constraint, everything we know will be put into the petition to the court.  However, I must be constrained by legal advice and I cannot act irresponsibly.  I want to ensure that we succeed and that we follow procedures in a thorough and fair fashion.  As the Minister with statutory responsibility, I must be able to prove to the court that I have acted fairly in handling these matters.</P>

      <P>The fact that National Irish Bank confirmed the RTE story is the most significant information legally.  We will act immediately on foot of it.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Keaveney's question, there is provision in the Companies Act for the court to make a restitution order to ensure that people are properly compensated.  I cannot say that the bank's customers in Carndonagh will be singled out ahead of customers of other branches. I am seeking to ensure that all the affected customers are dealt with fairly and quickly, that their accounts are corrected and interest and compensation paid.  All costs involved should be paid by National Irish Banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a proposal to build at least one superstore or hypermarket in the Dublin area and it seems likely that other such stores will follow.  In assessing developments of this kind, it is important to remember that we live in an open economy where the rules of the single market apply.  I have no power to prevent these developments and we must recall that Irish companies have as much right to open businesses in other member states of the Community as companies from other member states have to open here.  This is a right which many Irish firms have exploited very successfully.</P>
      <P>These developments are subject to the provisions of the Competition Acts which govern behaviour in the market.  The Acts prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of a dominant position.  However, developments in any sector which increase consumer choice and reduce prices are in the interests of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of new stores will lead to significant job creation both at the construction phase and subsequently.  The extent to which these will displace existing jobs is difficult to assess.  Given the growth in the sector it is reasonable to predict that the net employment effect will be positive.  One area of particular concern which I am actively addressing is the effect on suppliers to the retail sector.  Forbairt is in the process of establishing a supplier development programme which it will shortly pilot.  This programme will determine, at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist the Irish sub supply base to respond to the challenges <Col N="294" /> arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of new opportunities which are arising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's interpretation of what constitutes a hypermarket or superstore? Is it a store on the scale of 50,000 square feet or 100,000 square feet?  Is she aware that in other countries such as the United Kingdom and France, because hyperstores have been allowed to proliferate on the edges of towns, business has been sucked from other locations?  Will she discuss with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the possibility of introducing, as in the United Kingdom, a planning measure under which the scale of such stores would be taken into account to minimise their destructive impact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to discuss the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Under existing provisions local authorities have the power to designate certain areas.  The Deputy is concerned mainly about the impact on towns from a commercial and social point of view.  I share her concern. The bigger the store the fewer the opportunities for smaller outlets.  This is a matter of some concern in rural Ireland.  Given the extended opening hours of many hyperstores, it is having a negative impact on rural communities in particular.  Having regard to our membership of the European Union and the opportunities that exist for Irish companies in other jurisdictions, our capacity to act in this area is limited.</P>
      <P>We all know what we mean when we talk about a multiple store &mdash; the typical Dunnes Stores or Quinnsworth supermarket.  The advantage in the economy has been that they have kept the price of food products down.  There is intense competition in the sector.  This has had a favourable impact on inflation, notwithstanding some of the adverse effects to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>In November Forfás produced a report on the retail sector.  It estimates that the share of UK multiples in the Irish market is likely to increase from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in the short to medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the British companies which are talking about building large stores are also talking about siting petrol outlets at these locations?  This would have an effect on retailers in the immediate locality.  If people visit a superstore to buy their groceries, newspapers, tights and so on, they will also buy petrol.  Will the Minister examine this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also examine the possibility of introducing an amendment to the competition Acts, 1991-96, to provide that, in assessing whether an undertaking is in a dominant position in the Irish market, regard will have to be had to its global turnover and trading activities within the European Union?  While some of these stores will not be in a dominant position here, they are <Col N="295" /> in a dominant position within the European Union.  There are 30,000 people directly involved in the small grocery sector and a further 30,000 in the supply sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by at least one of the oil companies about the provision of petrol outlets.  This is now a feature in the United Kingdom and other European countries. I am not certain what we can do to resolve the difficulties but the matter is being examined within the Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made the point that, while a particular superstore or hypermarket may not be in a dominant position in the Irish market, it may be in a dominant position in the European market. In the context of mergers, if companies are over a certain size the matter is referred on.  I am not certain that we could restrict companies locating here on the basis that they are in a dominant position in the European market.  Each market has to be defined.  This is a difficult thing to do when it comes to competition policy.  The enforcement powers of the Competition Authority granted by my predecessor are effective in ensuring nobody abuses a dominant position, which is a separate matter.</P>
      <P>We have to ensure the interests of the consumer are protected and that the consumer gets good value for money at the lowest possible price. One of the benefits has been that the consumer has been getting good value for money.  As I said on a previous occasion to Deputy Perry, because of competition between the multiples, the price of products covered by the groceries order went up more than the price of products not covered by it.  This is ironic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to thwart competition or prevent people buying goods at the lowest possible price.  Will the Minister agree that a method has been found in the United Kingdom &mdash; PPG6 &mdash; to minimise the destructive impact of hyperstores and that the United Kingdom has not been found to be in breach of EU regulations? The Minister should consider this as a matter of urgency before the onslaught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not responsible for planning legislation, I will be happy to discuss the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to identify the most appropriate way to exercise control over these developments. I misunderstood the Deputy.  I thought she was suggesting that changes should be made to competition law.  I am not certain that we can do that.  If there are environmental measures we can take to amend the planning Acts, we should examine them.  I will ask the Department to prepare documentation on this issue with a view to raising it with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <Quest>if she will use her powers under the Competition Act, 1991, to instigate an investigation into the Diageo-Guinness takeover of United Beverages; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I previously outlined to the House, Guinness Ireland Group voluntarily notified its proposed takeover of United Beverages Holdings to the Competition Authority on 4 September 1997 seeking clearance of the proposal under the competition Acts.  This ensured the proposal would be subjected to a thorough investigation by an independent authority and rendered it unnecessary for me to exercise my powers under the competition Acts.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority has not yet finalised its consideration of the proposal and has yet to make its decision.  Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to comment while the matter is in the hands of the independent statutory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion the Minister accepted responsibility for missing the original deadline for reference of the matter to the Competition Authority.  We are faced with a situation where Diageo will have 100 per cent control of the largest drinks wholesaler in the drinks business, a shareholding in the second largest and 100 per cent control of the third largest. Because of its over-reaching power in up to 11,000 outlets it can block the entry of new entrants into the market.  The European Commission decided in October that, because Guinness, Grand Met and Diageo had too much power in the distribution market here, with the result that the environment was anti-competitive, they should divest themselves of some of their distribution business.  If the takeover of United Beverages proceeds, the decision of the European Commission will be undermined and we will be left with a closed shop in the drinks distribution business.  It is critical that the Minister should try to prevent this.</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste find it disturbing that the Competition Authority has refused to meet some of the key objectors, such as Murphys and Irish Distillers, and other important domestic Irish producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Competition Authority is the appropriate authority to examine the matter.  The Minister has two powers under the Competition Acts.  One is under section 11 where the authority can be asked to carry out an inquiry or an investigation to establish the practice in relation to the distribution and supply of goods or the provision of services.  Under section 14 the authority can be asked to carry out an inquiry if the Minister is of the opinion that someone is abusing a dominant position.  Before a Minister can do that, however, <Col N="297" /> they must establish that a company is in a dominant position and is abusing it.  Under EU law, a dominant position is considered to arise when one can act independently of one's competitors &mdash; in other words, when one's competitors do not matter.  I am not certain those circumstances arise in this case.  We should await the report of the Competition Authority which has issued its initial recommendation and invited submissions, which it is now assessing, before we make any further comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste have in her possession a draft of the Competition Authority's decision?  Representations made to me suggest that may be the case.  Many independent Irish producers want the Tánaiste to re-establish her competitive credentials in this regard.  A mistake was made by the Department last summer before the 28th Dáil met and we had a chance to question the Tánaiste about it.  However, I commend her for taking responsibility for that.  This situation is dragging on and it could lead to job losses. Many smaller Irish brewers and distillers believe that further inward investment will be discouraged if this overweening giant, Diageo, is allowed to dominate the wholesale production business.</P>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste concerned that Diageo Guinness-Grand Met is possibly the group with the biggest advertising share in the press?  Many small producers believe this issue has not been covered adequately in the media.  When Deputy Owen and I raised it on past occasions, we received little media coverage.  Small competitors are worried that the media are not prepared to allow a full and frank discussion of this matter because of their fear of losing advertising revenue.  The evidence available to me suggests that this take-over should not go ahead.  The Tánaiste should ensure it does not happen and that competition is maintained in the drinks business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Competition Authority informed me that it was likely to approve this take-over and asked me for observations.  It informed me before 5 March that it was its intention to grant a licence in the case of Guinness Ireland Group, United Beverages Holding.  I asked it to ensure that competition operates in all sectors of the economy, particularly in markets which, for whatever reason, have been characterised by dominance or high levels of concentration in the past.  I wanted such markets to be opened up to the full forces of competition.  I also said we trusted that the authority would make every reasonable effort to afford each of these parties objecting such opportunities as they request to express their concerns and to give full consideration to all submissions before coming to a decision.  I am satisfied the authority will do that as it is a competent authority with the appropriate expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I usually receive complaints that the authority is too aggressive in seeking to enforce competition or collect information.  Recently, a number <Col N="298" /> of Deputies from all sides of the House complained to me about one particular investigation in which it was involved.  I do not have any function in relation to those matters.  I have every confidence that the authority will take into account the various points made by the Deputy and interests in that sector.</P>
    <P>I was not aware that this group is the biggest advertiser.  However, that will not influence the authority as it is extremely independent and determined to ensure that competition exists in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>The closing date for submissions was 6 March.  Is the Tánaiste concerned that the Competition Authority did not meet the principal objectors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be critical of an independent authority which is funded by my Department.  Provision was made recently to appoint another member to the authority to assist it in its endeavours.  Competition is essential if we want to be able to withstand the pressures which will inevitably flow from economic and monetary union where our scope to manoeuvre will be limited. We will not be able to affect exchange rates, so competition policy will be even more important, particularly to ensure that consumers get value for money.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if all parties were met &mdash; I do not know if they were met at a preliminary stage &mdash; but that is a matter for the chairman, Professor McNutt, and the members of the authority, particularly those carrying out this inquiry.  It would be wrong for me to interfere.  The important thing is that it makes the right decision, not necessarily that it does what is perceived to be the right thing.  I am concerned about the right decision being made and I have every confidence it will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that I appointed an authorised officer on Monday last, 23 March, under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, for <Col N="299" /> the purpose of obtaining further information from National Irish Bank in order to ascertain whether, where relevant, the operations of National Irish Bank and its associated companies meet the requirements of the Insurance Acts and regulations and whether breaches of that legislation may have occurred.  I have asked the authorised officer to present his report to me within two months.  The House will also be aware of the ongoing investigations being conducted on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners concerning allegations of tax evasion and by the Central Bank into the operations of National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint the authorised officer follows ministerial and departmental inquiries from National Irish Bank and extensive and ongoing consultations between the Tánaiste and myself, our departmental officials, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office, over the past seven weeks.  The Attorney General's office has engaged counsel to advise on the basis of the information provided in response to our inquiries whether breaches of insurance law may have occurred, justifying the submission of the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The results of counsel's examination of issues raised by our Department and the Chief State Solicitor's office indicated, having regard to the complexity of the legislation involved, the need to obtain further detailed information from National Irish Bank.  When I studied the initial information and the legal advice, it became clear that in order to obtain the further information prescribed by counsel the appointment of an authorised officer with statutory powers was necessary, notwithstanding the co-operation of National Irish Bank in the preliminary written inquiries.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an authorised officer to examine the NIB CMI insurance arrangements was an appropriate response given the information available to us last Monday.  We require more information to address the insurance issues and it is my intention that the authorised officer should continue his work.</P>
    <P>As regards section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, the section provides that the Minister may appoint an inspector, on petition to the High Court, to investigate the affairs of a company where there are circumstances suggesting that, <i>inter alia</i>, its affairs are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors or for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.  In previous section 8 cases, petitions were preceded by preliminary examinations.</P>
    <P>The information becoming available yesterday from the RTE inquiries is a cause of serious concern to the Government.  We are currently taking legal advice on the appointment of an inspector by the High Court under section 8 of the Companies Act and we hope to proceed with this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Col N="300" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Will he agree that the steps the Government took since 26 January have been extremely tardy and that if they had been taken expeditiously we might have got the information made available through RTE yesterday sooner? Will he agree he should have proceeded in January or February by using section 8 of the Companies Act?  There was a clear indication by the banks in their public statements that they were concerned about the use of the CMI insurance bond schemes and the motivation for their use.  Given that they ceased the practice of their use, they must have had some evidence that was something they should not have been using.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify with the Minister of State the exact sequence of events.  I understand he wrote to the bank around 23 January when the information became available.  The Tánaiste, in reply to an earlier question, said that the Minister of State did not get legal advice on what the banks had told him until 10 March.  Why did it take from then until 10 March to get that?  If he got that legal advice on 10 March why did it take from then until 19 March to use the very weak powers of the insurance Act to put in place an authorised officer?  In view of the information that became available yesterday, does he consider the two months deadline given to his authorised official is now irrelevant and that he should ask the official to give him whatever information he has so that it can be used by the Tánaiste in her submission to the High Court for the appointment of an inspector under section 8 of the 1990 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject emphatically the Deputy's allegation that there was any tardiness involved by myself, the Tánaiste, our officials or Department acting on behalf of the Government on this issue.  I can give a blow by blow account of this situation.  Under no circumstances were any difficulties created or any delay in the appointment of an exceedingly competent authorised officer to proceed with this matter.  I have the utmost confidence in his ability to ascertain the most detailed information required under the law to pursue a conclusion to his report.</P>
      <P>I wish to put some matters on the record which may take some time.  Alleged irregularities regarding the selling of insurance products in Ireland by National Irish Bank, on behalf of an Isle of Man insurer, were contained in media reports emanating at 9 p.m. on the RTE News on Friday, 23 January.  Those were subsequently carried in the national papers over that weekend on Saturday, 24 January and Sunday, 25 January. They first came to my attention on Saturday, 24 January when I purchased the morning newspapers. I immediately consulted my private secretary and told him to be available on Monday morning and to have relevant officials ready because I wanted to consult them on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Northern Ireland at meetings on the Monday and I had consultations at the highest <Col N="301" /> level with my Department on a number of occasions pertaining to this matter.  The Secretary General of the Department and his officials had further consultations with the Chief State Solicitor's office regarding this matter on Monday, 26 January.  A letter from me, drafted in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office, was issued to the chief executive of National Irish Bank on 27 January 1998 seeking answers to a number of questions.  National Irish Bank responded to my letter on 29 January 1998 and its response was forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's office for further advice.  Internal Department inquiries and examination of the papers continued in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office and further information on sample policies was sought from National Irish Bank.  The bank fully co-operated in this regard.</P>
    <P>Counsel's opinion was furnished to the Department on 10 March 1998.  Counsel advised <i>inter alia</i> that further information would be required from National Irish Bank relating to the precise steps undertaken by National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited in effecting the insurance policies.  Counsel concluded that as matters stood there was a legal basis for seeking further information from the National Irish Bank to take a position on the legality or otherwise of the NIB's CMI operations.  I subsequently got a request from the National Irish Bank to meet its management pertaining to the involvement by it in CMI emanating from inquiries instituted by the National Bank of Australia, its parent company.</P>
    <P>The insurance legislation under which we are operating is complex.  A particular difficulty arises from the statutory positions on which breaches of the insurance Acts and regulations could be pursued.  Section 9 of the 1936 Act which prohibits the effecting of insurance with an unauthorised insurer still subsists though its original purpose was to protect the domestic insurance industry.  It now must stand alongside section 6 of the European Community's Framework Regulations, 1994, which were introduced to liberalise the provision of insurance services across all the member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>After the request came in from National Irish Bank to meet its management the Attorney General's office and counsel were consulted and the advice available to us was it would be inadvisable to meet National Irish Bank for the meeting scheduled and requested for 19 March.  The Tánaiste was out of the country.  I considered this was a very serious matter.  The Tánaiste returned to the country last Sunday evening.  I left my home on Monday morning to come to Dublin, I met the Tánaiste and senior officials and we took a decision based on the information available to us to appoint an authorised officer, Mr. Cosgrave, an accountant in our Department who has an excellent track record, under section 59 of the insurance Act.  The appointment was made for the purpose of obtaining information to enable me to exercise my functions under the insurance <Col N="302" /> Acts and, in particular, to determine whether any breaches of the insurance Acts and regulations may have occurred.  National Irish Bank has co-operated with the appointed authorised officer.  I believe the appointment of an authorised officer was an appropriate action given the knowledge and the information which we had last Monday. We require more information to address the insurance issues and it is my intention that the authorised officer should continue his work under the section of the Act under which he was appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow up on a few points in the long answer of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it was detailed.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that taking a six week period to deal with this matter can be considered dealing with it expeditiously?  He said he wrote those letters in the latter part of January and he passed NIB's reply of 29 January to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and counsel, but it was not until 10 March he sought legal advice on a matter that was undermining the credibility of our banking system at that time.  Little did we know how much it would be undermined by information coming into the public arena.  A bank was under scrutiny for using a method for tax evasion purposes. Is the Minister of State satisfied that six weeks is a sufficiently speedy time within which to get counsel's advice?  In view of the fact that the Tánaiste may well be in the High Court this afternoon or tomorrow morning seeking the appointment of an inspector under section 8, will he ensure the information his authorised official was examining will go before the courts tomorrow so that it can be included in the remit of an inspector who will hopefully be appointed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion although I love history.  Six weeks was not a long time.  We are legislators and we must operate within the law.  Deputy Owen will understand that when one is discharging one's duties in a Government office, as she did on one occasion, one must move carefully to ensure that one does not become a victim of the law erroneously, by misadventure or otherwise.  I must be guided by the legal advice available to me, by way of the professional advice within my Department and the legal advice available to me.  I cannot tell lawyers who get a brief how and when they should discharge it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a matter is referred to a lawyer, one expects it to be examined in great detail.  This was a matter of great complexity which was examined in detail and advice was submitted to us on 10 March and became available to me on 11 March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a subsequent request for a meeting with management of the bank.  That again was referred for legal advice and the response, returned on 18 March, stated it would be inadvisable to hold the meeting scheduled for 19 March.  As I told the Deputy at that stage the Tánaiste the relevant Minister, was out of the country.  I was acting on her behalf and I was honoured to do so.</P>
      <P>As soon as the Tánaiste returned, I had consultations with her and our officials and within one and a half hours we were in a position to act. That was a rapid response taking into account the complexities of the matter, the advice available, certain risks with which one must proceed and the track record of previous applications and appointments.  The Deputy is not giving credit for the efforts made on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, one of the most astonishing aspects about the Minister of State's performance is that he answered in detail questions which you would not allow me to table, in particular where I asked for the details of legal advice which the Tánaiste had sought and received on NIB, including costs; if she had sought the advice of the Attorney General on the affair; if she disclosed to him that her political party had a business relationship with the same bank and if she sought any legal advice as to whether the Progressive Democrats Party's business relationship with NIB came under the scope of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why those questions were disallowed.  The Minister of State has just given a convoluted response to a number of those questions. He knew on 23 January that the law was being broken by NIB in the CMI affair and that a massive fraud was taking place.  I do not understand why he, or the senior Minister, did not take action because the House should be concerned about tax evasion of that order.</P>

      <P>A belated decision has been taken to petition the High Court, as Deputy Owen and I urged at least four weeks ago.  Why will the Minister of State not consider simply asking the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation to begin an investigation of NIB this evening on the basis that there are <i>prima facie</i> allegations of serious theft from the public by officers of this institution and then send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions and get to the heart of the matter?</P>
      <P>In view of the role NIB plays in our banking system was the Minister of State or the Tánaiste in touch with the Australian owners of the bank on the CMI matter and the latest horrendous revelations? Has he considered using the powers available to him under the Companies Act to suspend the current management of NIB and replace them with authorised officers to run the company until the High Court and the other three investigations have been completed?</P>

I have acted on those allegations and discharged my responsibilities in that area.  Other matters that have been raised involve other State agencies.  Deputy Broughan's questions were adequately answered by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance during the earlier two hour debate.</P>

    <P>We do not have any statutory responsibility for National Australia Bank and it would not have been proper for us to have consulted with it.  Our function is to deal with its subsidiary in Ireland. It is a matter for others to make certain recommendations at the conclusion of the investigation. The Government is seriously concerned with regard to the complex matters which were brought into the public domain yesterday evening.  All relevant Departments and State agencies have been alerted to take the necessary action.  We will proceed with positive, practical <Col N="305" /> action to ensure we get to the bottom of this and never have a repetition by any financial institution here.</P>

      <Quest>the initiatives, if any, she has taken in relation to training programmes geared towards meeting the skill requirements of the labour market and the needs of individuals; and the emphasis, if any, which will be given to equipping the unemployed and early school leavers with skills that are in demand and will be in demand in labour markets.</Quest>

      <P>There is a broad range of initiatives in the training area on a number of levels, aimed at identifying and meeting the skills needs of the growing Irish economy.  FÁS is taking a wide range of actions in this connection and it has carried out a programme of research activities to identify the sectors and occupations that are growing and are expected to grow in the future. FÁS has also carried out research into areas of skills shortages, both in terms of recruitment difficulties and skills deficiencies.  FÁS is running a number of programmes to meet skills needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has made specific reference to early school leavers and the unemployed.  The Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for young people aged between 15 and 18 years who have <Col N="306" /> left school early without qualifications or vocational training.  The national traineeship programme currently being developed has already proven to be a flexible way to meet emerging skills demands, particularly in the fields of technology and foreign languages.  I am working with FÁS to ensure that we reach the ambitious target set in the White Paper on Human Resource Development of 5,000 traineeship places by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The number of apprenticeships has risen rapidly in recent years to meet the demands of the economy, particularly in construction.  In 1997 a record 5,300 persons were registered as apprentices compared with a level of 4,200 in 1996 and levels of around 3,000 in the preceding years.  In November last, the Government announced the establishment of a £250 million education technology investment fund as part of a major drive aimed at raising the skills profile of our students and workers.  Also last November, I launched in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science a new business, education and training partnership.  This will develop national strategies at the highest levels that tackle skills needs, manpower forecasting and education for industry and business.</P>
    <P>One area where I have some concern relates to the relatively low proportion of long-term unemployed people who participate on training programmes. This is partly due to an inadequacy of foundation or progression type programmes such as would enable long-term unemployed people, frequently coming from a low education or skills base, to access higher skills programmes.  I have asked the new board of FÁS to address this problem and I expect that it will bring forward proposals later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that a radical shake-up of training and a new approach to unemployment to combat the skills shortage is now needed?  Given that 240,000 people are unemployed and it is expected that job creation in the labour market will be 7 per cent, the numbers unemployed will effectively not be reduced.  What interest groups will be appointed to the expert group on future skills?  It is important that the group represents business, the unemployed and others concerned with employment.  Will the Tánaiste clarify why, from the EU allocation of £100 million for training in small and medium sized enterprises, the Government allots only £5.5 million for this area?  This fund is specially designed for small enterprise initiatives but only a small fraction is spent on this area.</P>
      <P>Will she also examine the future of in-house training, which is crucial for job creation?  FÁS is doing an excellent jobs but a number of people on training schemes are not getting into the workforce because their schemes are not of benefit to employers.  She should consider funding employers' specific needs if they guarantee they will maintain long-term employment.  That would increase productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Multinational companies receive £15,000 per employee while indigenous companies receive £3,000.  The service sector is the greatest job creator of all but it receives no income support.  Will the Tánaiste consider funding an initiative with FÁS to train business people to take on members of staff?  The job start scheme provides £80 per week, which is totally inadequate.  It means that people unemployed for three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We need radical reform of our existing policies on human resource development and the foundation laid by my predecessor in the White Paper on Human Resources is where we should begin.  As I told the House previously, that is why a small group was established last autumn, shortly after I took up office, between my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, because the two Departments must work closely together.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs deals with the clients who are unemployed and on the live register and it is the responsibility of my Department to create and sustain jobs and to provide training problems to ensure more people can gain access to jobs.  That is the priority.</P>
      <P>This year we will spend £750 million on various measures to encourage people from welfare to work.  That is a substantial amount of money and we must ensure we are spending it in the right place.  As the Deputy knows, a number of skills shortages have arisen in the economy, particularly in the electronic and software sectors, the high-tech end of the economy.  As a fire brigade measure the Government had to take radical steps on gaining office to ensure we had the supply of skills necessary for the emerging jobs, because companies were beginning to wonder whether they could continue to invest in Ireland if we were not going to have people with suitable skills.  That is why the £250 million fund was established over a three year period to ensure we have a ready supply of people with skills for emerging jobs.  This year there are an extra 2,000 people on various education programmes, such as PLC, institute of technology and university courses being trained and equipped with the skills for the emerging jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, there are clearly pressures on small to medium sized industry and that is one reason we are taking the industry support services from FÁS and putting them into the new indigenous agency which will be created by July. If we are to support it correctly and help it grow, <Col N="308" /> develop and compete in the more competitive environment after EMU, it is essential that training is part of the package of support which Government gives to industry.  If training is provided by a different agency from the one which is providing grant aid to allow companies to grow, which is also different from the one which supports companies in the export market, we are taking a diffuse approach which does not get the best results.</P>
    <P>The Deputy wants to change the three year rule because someone out of work for that period has difficulties.  There is a dilemma in that regard because in so far as the State has resources to spend &mdash; and they are considerable, as I said earlier &mdash; it is important that we target the long-term unemployed.  Only 11 per cent of those in that group go on training courses and the longer one is out of work the more difficult it is to have access to employment opportunities.  In the context of the review being carried out my priority is to ensure resources are targeted at the long-term unemployed.  It is not necessary to exclude others and we clearly cannot do that but one wonders whether the State should spend money through its training agency on people with third level or university qualifications &mdash; and in some case postgraduate qualifications &mdash; rather than on the long-term unemployed.  The dilemma is that the person with higher qualifications has a better opportunity to gain employment but one could argue that regardless of the State's training programme those with high qualifications will get employment opportunities in any event.  The working group of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will report shortly about the way forward on these matters.  It is intended to implement the White Paper's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 25, 30, 49, 53, 71 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Ms Evelyn Owens, the chairperson of the National Minimum Wage Commission, has indicated to me her intention to present to me the commission's report before the end of this month. I intend to publish the report as soon as possible and to bring forward quickly my proposals to Government on this matter.  The report may come before the end of March, which is only a few days away.  It is my intention on receiving the report to bring proposals to the Government on its recommendations and to publish the report at the same time.  It may be useful if a committee of the House or the House itself were to debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Tánaiste confirm that the remit of the commission chaired by Ms Owens is to indicate how the Government's proposal to introduce a minimum wage is to be implemented, not whether it will be implemented?  Has the Government set aside the resources which will be required when a minimum wage is introduced? Irrespective of the recommendations of the commission there will be costs involved in introducing a minimum wage &mdash; it has been indicated that home helps, for instance, receive far less than what is considered to be a minimum wage and if the provision is to be introduced for such people there will be a 100 to 200 per cent increase in health board budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I addressed the commission I asked it to recommend how the Government might introduce a national minimum hourly wage or wages &mdash; that is also in its terms of reference.  However, the commission may well recommend a particular minimum wage and it is not precluded from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect the report will be comprehensive.  The Commission consulted widely and it also consulted <Col N="310" /> the social partners.  The Government does not know what minimum wage might be recommended and we have not made provision this year in the Estimates for the introduction of a national minimum wage.  Deputy Owen is correct that if a national minimum wage were to be set somewhere between £3.50 and £5 per hour for certain categories of work, the State, in its broadest sense, would probably be found to be one of the biggest defaulters of that hourly rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a poor indictment on the State.  There is no doubt there will be costs attached to a rate being struck anywhere between the two figures I mentioned.  Approximately 150,000 workers are currently covered by the JLC procedure, the Joint Labour Committee recommendations, which covers workers in several categories in the economy and rates from approximately £5 to just below £10 per hour.  We must ensure that the way we introduce a national minimum wage does not cause wage inflation because if everybody regards their rate per hour as relative to the lowest possible rate or the rates below them, they may well argue that they are entitled to the differential of £3 or £4 between the minimum that applies under the JLC model and what they receive.  We must ensure that does not happen because wage inflation would cause major problems in this economy, make us very uncompetitive and put pressure on vulnerable indigenous industries in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying that the Minister sounds as though she is backing away from the agreed commitment she and Deputy Ahern gave last May to introduce a statutory national minimum wage.  She sounds as if she is trying to have her cake and eat it which I do not believe is possible. The Minister mentioned the JLCs.  Presumably Ms Owens and her committee will report in favour of the establishment of the statutory minimum wage.  Does the Minister propose to introduce legislation along the lines Margaret Beckett has indicated in the United Kingdom, or has she given any thought to how it might be implemented on a statutory basis?  In relation to JLCs, does the Minister see that system being used as the central plank of the new system and extending from that or does she envisage a totally new system along the lines of that operated in the United States?  Has the Minister's Department undertaken any studies of the operation of minimum wages throughout the EU in countries such as Holland and France as well as the American experience?  What lessons has the Department drawn from those studies given that US, probably the most effective and efficient economy in the world, has had a minimum wage system for many decades?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not backing away from the commitment in the programme for Government. <Col N="311" /> I am simply saying we need to be careful in the way we go about introducing national minimum wages.  I look forward to receiving the report from the commission next week to see how it recommends this should be done.</P>
      <P>I have not personally examined the research in this area but the commission has and it has carried out its own research.  We appointed a commission because this is such a complex issue.  I felt the most appropriate way to do that was to appoint a commission of five persons representative of the various strands in our society, the social partners, the Chairperson of the Labour Court and two other members who have experience and strong views in this area.  The commission consulted widely and carried out its own research but because the issue was so complex we had to extend the time originally given to the commission.  We initially hoped it would report by the end of last year.</P>
      <P>I am aware that minimum wages have applied in the United States for some considerable time. When I was in the US recently I saw notices displayed in some of the companies I visited and I understand the rate is approximately $4.30 per hour and is due to increase shortly to over $5 per hour.  If we apply that rate in the Irish context it is just over £3.  I do not know what the commission will recommend but it is the Government's intention to implement those recommendations in whatever way and as quickly as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Major tax reform will be needed in regard to a minimum wage because a single person earns only £67 tax free.  It was announced in the UK budget recently that every home should have a tax free income of £212.  If we introduce a minimum wage it is important to implement tax reform and the Minister should have discussions on the net income with the Minister for Finance. I support a gross wage of £5 per hour but employees are concerned about the net income and major changes are needed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that in trying to deal with one problem &mdash; the exploitation of vulnerable workers in certain sections of the economy &mdash; we do not create another and extend the black economy.  That is not the intention.  Tax and PRSI have a major role to play in relation to this matter and we need to deal with the two in tandem. As Deputy Owen said earlier, for the State employees who are earning rates that would be regarded as below what might be a reasonable national minimum wage, there are financial implications that will have to be examined also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that care has to be taken with the implementation of the legal minimum wage but will she indicate a time scenario to the House?  Has work started on drafting the legislation?  There was resistance in the Department to the notion of a legal minimum wage.  Almost a year has elapsed in terms of the <Col N="312" /> lifetime of the Government.  The Government is fairly shaky and it might not be around for much longer.  Will the Minister give the House an approximate date when legislation might be published to give effect to a legal minimum wage having regard to the fact that there is a serious low pay problem in this economy, substantial profits are being taken and low paid workers are not enjoying the benefits of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a commitment in relation to when the legislation will be introduced.  The first step was to establish the commission to advise the Government on how best we can introduce a national minimum wage taking into account all the factors I mentioned earlier.  I am not trying to be smart but the Deputy's party and the Labour Party were in Government in recent times and no commitment was entered into to introduce a national minimum wage and legislation was not forthcoming.  The Government will implement in full the recommendations of the commission in relation to this matter as quickly, effectively and efficiently as we can taking into account the difficulties that arise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that because she was unqualified earlier in her support. She said the Government will implement the recommendations in whatever way it can.  Will the Minister confirm that the Government will implement whatever the commission recommends? If the Government does not like the recommendations, will it have the latitude to change the recommendations to increase or decrease the figure if the budget does not allow the Government to implement it?  Is it not the case that the Department should have already commenced the preparation of the broad strokes of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware what the commission will recommend.  In fact, I cannot be certain it will recommend that we strike a particular rate.  It may decide to leave that matter to the Government.  I cannot give a blank cheque commitment notwithstanding the fact that I have enormous confidence in the commission because of its composition and the manner in which it has gone about its work.  The commission is made up of a balanced group of people representative of both sides of the social partnership.  The intention is to implement the findings of the commission bearing in mind that it will be expensive and will require substantial change.  If a rate is recommended, and presumably it will be a reasonable rate, the State is perhaps one of the biggest defaulters and given what Deputy Perry said about the impact on industry and the effect on the tax and PRSI system, changes will have to be made but the commitment is to do that as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility of the 35 county and city enterprise boards, the first of which was established in October 1992 and which come under the aegis of our Department, is to support enterprises with ten employees or fewer. These are commonly known as micro enterprises. County and city enterprise boards are at present co-funded by the Irish Exchequer and by the EU under the operational programme for local urban and rural development, which is scheduled to end in December 1999.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the outstanding contribution of county and city enterprise boards to the development of micro enterprise and job creation since their establishment.  The boards have assisted some 8,000 projects, which have created over 11,000 jobs up to December 1997.</P>
      <P>Although the operational programme still has 21 months to run, our Department is already engaged in consultations with the enterprise boards to elicit their views on how the momentum of micro enterprise development and job creation can be sustained beyond 1999.

The State funded the boards from 1992 until 1994 when the operational programme came into being.  They currently receive 25 per cent funding from the Exchequer and 75 per cent from the European Union.  Prior to that, the old county development team system operated from 1965 <Col N="314" /> and was totally funded by the State at a very low cost.  The average cost between 1965 and 1992 was about £60,000 per annum.  The State has got tremendous value for money from the boards.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, no other agency or organisation was prepared to deal with individuals with entrepreneurial flair and ideas who needed support.  We created a structure whereby they could get technical assistance grants to explore an idea.  If that proved positive they could then qualify for the various grants from the boards.  The boards are here to stay, as far as I am concerned.  They have a key role to play in local job creation and the development of enterprise from the lowest levels.  They are very involved in creating an enterprise culture in secondary schools.  The boards have the full support of the Government.  They are in the proper place, with the other State agencies, in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is where we intend to keep them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the new company agency, only 80 people will be transferred from FÁS which will still have in excess of 2,000 people involved in its operations.  The services to industry section of FÁS, which has a staff of 80, is being transferred to the new organisation.  FÁS will continue with all its other activities apart from that small unit.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have experience of the county enterprise system and the local partnership boards.  Is it not very late in the day for the Minister and the Minister of State not to have any plans in place for the huge downturn in EU funding which will occur between 1999 and 2002? They should be urgently drawing up a White Paper on this area.</P>
      <P>I support some of the comments made about the Dublin and Fingal enterprise boards, both of which had a pretty good impact on small business. However, there is deep uncertainty, and perhaps despondency, in those organisations and the partnership boards about their ultimate future.  How will the Minister of State calm that, give them some hope for the future and ensure his invention, if that is what it was, continues to play a good role?</P>

      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Broughan, there are still 21 months to run.  The boards have a tremendous track record.  We are consulting the people in the front line who are dealing with the public.  I am quite confident they have the professionalism and the ability to make proposals which will ensure they will have a key role to play in industrial development and job creation in the years ahead.  The operational programme only began in 1994 and still has almost two years to run.  I am very confident we will come to a positive conclusion.</P>

      <P>The 35 enterprise boards are doing fantastic work.  With regard to the marginalisation and regionalisation of different boards will the Minister of State prioritise the boards which require specific needs?  Will he look at the devolution aspect of regionalised boards in different counties along the western seaboard, especially with regard to cross-Border funding?  For example, the Sligo Enterprise Board can avail of cross-Border funding, but to obtain maximum funding State and EU funding would have to be regarded as supplementary funding.</P>

Doubtless he is aware that the local employment service operates in only 18 centres throughout the country, yet there is long-term unemployment in many other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my area of responsibility, but in line with Deputy Rabbitte's remarks, the Minister and I are at one in ensuring that there is an efficient State system.  The enterprise boards system should deal with the system outlined if it is best fitted to do so.  It will be taken into account in the overall review.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Perry's question, State funding is always additional to INTERREG funding, the operational programme and so on.  We cannot have duplication; there can be only co-funding.  We have no intention of creating a regionalised board system.  It is a matter for the boards to decide on their focus within their functional area.  The Deputy's board is fortunate in that it has a number of lines of funding available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking at facilities whereby the board could have an ongoing financial mechanism available to it, not alone from the Exchequer in the normal statutory way, but in other ways &mdash; in the grants it gives and systems it creates.  It may be able to create a revolving or cumulating fund, perhaps a loans fund, which would be constantly renewed and would be available to others as they come on stream with their ideas and projects.  We are looking at that.  I considered it in 1992 but I <Col N="317" /> was not there to proceed with it.  Some good work has been done in the meantime and if we find a solution we will implement it.</P>

      <P>Under proceedings currently before the courts it could be argued that the process of altering the terms of reference, to which I referred prior to the adjournment, was flawed or illegal, thereby jeopardising the State's defence of these proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lead story in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 15 March 1998 headed &ldquo;Secret memo contradicts Cabinet tribunal decisions&rdquo; stated, among other <Col N="318" /> things, that confidential documents revealed that on the eve of Cabinet approval of an amendment to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office believed it was not legally necessary.  The document quoted in the article is an internal submission to me of 9 March 1998 from an official in my Department.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that because there was a healthy discourse on the issues between my Department and the Attorney General's office there are irreconcilable differences between the two offices.  The reality is that the practice when preparing legislation is to engage in a detailed analysis of all the issues involved to tease out the legal principles and all of the practicalities.  In the course of this exercise, the Department and the parliamentary draftsman raised queries which required to be answered by the legal side of the Attorney General's office.  This is not an unusual course of events in the drafting of legislation and if everything were as clear as some people would like to pretend where the law is concerned we would not have any more court cases.</P>
    <P>There have also been suggestions from some commentators that legislation might not be necessary and these need to be addressed.  On Monday evening, 9 March 1998, the Attorney General's office advised my Department in writing that the Attorney General was of the view that primary legislation was necessary to amend section 1 of the Tribunal of Inquiries (Evidence) Act, 1921, to expressly provide for amendment of terms of reference of an instrument appointing a tribunal and applying the Act to the tribunal and that this view had been confirmed by independent senior counsel.  Taking into account the Attorney General's advice, the memorandum was submitted to Government seeking its approval to proceed with the legislation before the House.  The following new paragraph was inserted in the memorandum for the Government meeting of 10 March.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some commentators that tribunals are not established, as such, by the Act of 1921, rather that they are established by resolution of both Houses and that the Act of 1921 regarding evidence etc.  is merely applied to such tribunals.  The Attorney General, however, is of the view that primary legislation is necessary to amend section 1 of the Act of 1921 to expressly provide for amendment of terms of reference of an instrument appointing a tribunal and applying the Act to the tribunal.  This view is supported by independent senior counsel.  It is in the light of these advices that the Minister seeks approval to proceed with the legislation.</P>
    <P>At its meeting of 10 March 1998 &mdash; there is nothing sinister about this &mdash; the Government approved the text of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Jim Higgins and others that the Attorney General's advice is wrong.  It is also being suggested that I should <Col N="319" /> accept the view of an official as opposed to the view of the first law officer of the land who also sought independent legal advice to analyse the situation further but who had no doubt about the position.  I submit I had a clear duty to accept the advice of the Attorney General and I did so in good faith.  The Government, acting on my advice, also acted in good faith.  It would have been wrong to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton audaciously suggested that the senior counsel who gave advice to the Attorney General in this matter only did so after the Attorney General or the Government had trawled through the Law Library.  That is a disgraceful and scurrilous remark.  It calls into question the integrity of a senior counsel of considerable expertise, integrity and knowledge of this subject.  The Deputy should withdraw the allegation. It is wrong of him or of any other Member to make unfounded allegations of that kind in this House.</P>

      <P>Not only was the senior counsel to whom Deputy Upton referred not here but he does not have the opportunity to attend this House and clear his name.  Nor does he have the opportunity to challenge the Deputy on those remarks in court.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition also suggested that they did not have the same advice when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition, when in Government, were advised that primary legislation was necessary, by way of amendment of section 1 of the Act of 1921, to expressly provide for amendment of an instrument incorporating terms of reference and appointing a tribunal to which the Act of 1921 is applied.  They would now like to deny this. That does not surprise me.  However, it is clear from the provisions of the order which the Government made on 7 February 1997 setting up the Dunnes payments tribunal what the true position is.  They envisaged the possible necessity for a further resolution of the Dáil and Seanad in the event of any matters arising before that tribunal, and specific provision was made in the original order providing for its amendment.  Thus, the order allowed the Dáil and Seanad to make a further resolution that automatically applied to the original tribunal.  The provision was inserted by the Government of which Deputy John Bruton, the present leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Quinn, the present leader of the Labour Party, were members, because there was doubt as to the power to amend the order establishing the tribunal once it had been established.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Let me reiterate the point I made in my Second Stage speech which is that I spoke in person to the former Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, and he never at any stage was asked for or gave general advice to the effect that it was not possible to amend the terms of reference without legislation.  He was never asked for, and never gave the opinion, that legislation was necessary to amend the terms of reference. I imagine he would concur with the view that it is not necessary to change the terms of reference by way of legislation, that it could be done by way of simple resolution of this House. Doctors differ and patients die.  The Minister can quote one legal expert.  I am quoting a legal expert of considerable experience, knowledge and integrity and I do not want his name in any way impugned.</P>

      <P>I have stated that the provision was inserted by the Government of which Deputy Higgins was Chief Whip and of which two leaders of the Opposition were members, because there was doubt as to whether there was power to amend the order establishing a tribunal once it had been made.  With regard to Deputy Higgins's remarks in relation to the former Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, let me say that on the occasion in question Mr. Gleeson had a conflict of interest in that he had formerly acted for a party in the Dunne family litigation and as a result was unable to advise in relation to the setting up of the tribunal.  It was not Mr. Gleeson, for whom I have the highest personal and professional regard, who gave the advice.  In accordance with normal practice on such occasions, the Government's legal advice in this matter was provided by the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General.  Regardless of who gave the advice, the positive assertions now emanating from the Opposition benches that there is no doubt but that the matter can be dealt with by resolution, is to say the least, strange given the clear evidence that the Opposition had a considerable doubt when in Government and clearly were given precisely the same advice as this Government has been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to withdraw anything.  I am dealing with what the advice was in relation to the general question of the Dunnes tribunal.  I am dealing with that specific matter as an analogy to establish beyond doubt that the Government of the day had considerable doubt as to how this matter should be proceeded with in the light of advice it had received in relation to the Dunnes tribunal.  What advice Mr. Gleeson did or did not give in relation to other matters pertaining to this situation is not something I am prepared to go into at this time because I am not <i>au fait</i> with it in the context of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the need to introduce amending legislation in order to amend the instrument incorporating the terms of reference of a tribunal once it has been established.</P>
      <P>In my introduction to the debate, I outlined the reasons a change in the law is necessary but, given the comments made in the course of the debate, it is important that I state them clearly again. They are: (1) the legal advice is that primary legislation is necessary to properly deal with the matter by amending section 1 of the Act of 1921 expressly providing for amendment of terms of reference of an instrument appointing a tribunal and applying the act to the tribunal; (2) nowhere does the Act of 1921 provide for the amendment of the instrument which establishes the tribunal, and it is the prudent and legislatively responsible course of action to create an express power to so amend and put the matter beyond doubt; (3) the Government's view has been that once a tribunal is established, the tribunal should be allowed to proceed with certainty in the knowledge that its terms of reference will not be changed.  The overriding concern in relation to tribunals is to ensure that appropriate procedures apply to enable justice to be done to parties before those tribunals. Where a change in terms of reference is deemed necessary, such change could jeopardise the operation of a tribunal unless there are sufficient safeguards. The fourth reason I outlined was that while it is argued that the words &ldquo;any instrument supplemental thereto&rdquo; bestow a power of amendment of the original instrument, the Government's advice is that what is envisaged in those words is that the original instrument may contain the terms of reference of a tribunal and the appointment of one or more members of the tribunal, but the original instrument would be silent as to the application of the Act of 1921.  The purpose of a supplemental instrument is to apply the Act to a tribunal subsequent to its establishment. The fifth reason was: to attempt to amend the terms of reference simply by a resolution of both Houses and without express legislative provision would result in the creation of another tribunal side by side and parallel to the original tribunal. The tribunals would be distinct entities, albeit they would have the same individual as chairperson. This would be clearly absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Following on all the accusations and allegations which have been made in the course of this debate, I cannot put the matter more clearly than I have in relation to the law on this matter.  Let me repeat that it has been the consistent view in the Office of the Attorney General over many years that the terms of reference of a tribunal established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, once fixed, could not be changed.  To my knowledge no Attorney General has ever expressed any contrary opinion or contrary view.  That settled view has found expression on at least two occasions prior to the tenure of the present Attorney General.  The first occasion was when the beef tribunal was being established. Advice was given verbally by an official from the Attorney General's office that it would not be possible to change the terms of reference of a tribunal once it was established.  This advice was not sought formally, possibly because the terms of reference of the beef tribunal were so comprehensive that it was clear that there would be no subsequent need to amend them.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General at the time, Mr. John Murray, Senior Counsel, does not recollect whether he personally advised in relation to the matter but, in any event, he gave no written advice.  Advice emanating from the Attorney General's office is deemed to be the advice of the Attorney General, as anybody who has ever served in Government knows.  In addition, the McCracken tribunal was established after Judge Gerald Buchanan reported on the payment of money to politicians, but before he reported on whether any payments had been made to public servants.</P>
    <P>When the terms of reference of the tribunal were drafted, the senior legal assistant advised that a mechanism should be included which would permit the referral to the tribunal of any evidence which might subsequently become available as a result of a second part of Judge Buchanan's investigation without the need for an amendment to the terms of reference.  This mechanism involved a further resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas but not an amendment to the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>This novel and unusual mechanism was deemed necessary because it was considered that the terms of reference of a tribunal established under the 1921 Act could not be amended.  If it had been considered that the terms of reference could be amended, there would have been no need for the mechanism.  The reason for the insertion of this provision in the terms of reference, namely that it was considered that the terms of reference once fixed could not be changed, was made known by the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General to the members of the Government at that time.  I understand it was also made known to the advisers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton and others appeared to suggest that somebody should go to Mr. Justice Moriarty and ask him if he wants the terms of reference of his tribunal amended.  However, anybody who <Col N="323" /> went to Mr. Justice Moriarty, or any other judge in charge of a tribunal, and asked him if he felt the terms of reference of his tribunal should be amended might be considered by many to be interfering with the judicial independence of the chairperson of the tribunal.  If any member of the Government did that, legitimate questions would be asked in the House.</P>
    <P>I regret that Members of the House suggested that type of legal mumbo jumbo and tried to pass it off as desirable.  I also regret that Members of the House stated blandly as a matter of absolute fact that the advice of the Attorney General is wrong.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of the story of the man who would not agree that a particular horse won the Grand National in 1973.  When the history of the event was produced, he said the book was wrong.  This type of argument does not have any type of weight.  It makes no sense.  It was suggested that the Government is covering its tracks regarding the Ansbacher accounts and conjuring up new tricks.  These allegations are derived from extremely fertile imaginations.  The people who made them and who possess such fertile minds might be better engaged writing ghost stories or mystery novels or something which would keep them more usefully occupied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  &rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to outlaw discrimination on nine distinct grounds &mdash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  The scope of the Bill is comprehensive and deals with discrimination in work related activities from vocational training to access to employment, equal pay for work of equal value and employment conditions generally, including training, work experience and advancement within employment.  The Bill, when enacted, will give Ireland one of the most modern employment equality codes in Europe.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the fate of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996.  That Bill passed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas a year ago.  The entire Bill was referred to the Supreme Court by the President in a reference under Article 26 of the Constitution.  On 15 May 1997, the Supreme Court held that three provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution.  On taking office, priority was given to this aspect of the equality agenda, to examining the constitutional issues raised in the judgment and to returning the Bill, appropriately amended, to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the Bill before the House has two distinct advantages over other Bills which may come before the House in the current session. First, the Bill is almost identical in its provisions to the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which was considered by the previous Dáil and Seanad within the last 15 months.  I hope that the recency of the Dáil debate, even if the composition of the House has changed, will facilitate examination of the Bill.  Second, the Bill has been examined thoroughly by the Supreme Court, particularly as regards a range of key and controversial provisions, and has been found constitutionally sound except for the three provisions I mentioned. I hope that these facts will set a backdrop for balanced and informed deliberations in the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill was found by the Supreme Court to contain three provisions which were repugnant to the Constitution.  Two of these provisions are of a technical nature and were amenable to satisfactory redrafting in the Bill which is before the House.  The third provision which the Supreme Court found to be unconstitutional, that of reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities, raises profound issues, both legally and politically, about the scope available to legislators to deal with this socially important concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The 1996 Bill required an employer to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability unless the cost to the employer of providing the reasonable accommodation gave rise to undue hardship.  The Supreme Court found that this provision amounted to an attack on the property rights of the employer under Article 43 of the Constitution.  The advice which has been received and the subsequent changes made to the Bill allow for retention of the disability ground in the Bill.  The Bill defines disability to include the absence of bodily or mental faculties, having chronic disease, whether manifest, and a wide range of learning and personality conditions.  The implication of the Supreme Court judgment is that an employer, or a prospective employer, may be obliged by law to provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability.</P>
    <P>However, the employer cannot be similarly obliged to bear the costs of providing such reasonable accommodation.  The Bill requires an employer to provide special treatment and facilities for a person with a disability, unless the cost of such provision to the employer is more than a nominal cost.  In considering the total costs of any provision, State supports for workplace adaptation and equipment will be taken into account as well as any cost borne by the employer.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has recommended the preparation of a disabilities Bill.  The options for developing proposals for such a Bill are being examined in my Department.  There is an opportunity to revisit the question of statutory provision for reasonable accommodation in the context of specific disabilities legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the constitutional issues raised in the Supreme Court judgment about the disability ground in a fair and constructive way.  I am well aware also of a high level of concern, evident both in the Seanad debate on the Bill and through representative groups, that the Bill as drafted may not go far enough to ensure the rights of people with disabilities.  The view put to me is that the text of the Bill may stop short of the optimum provision that could be made in relation to reasonable accommodation, while at the same time respecting the terms of the Supreme Court judgment in the matter.  This proposition is being carefully examined.  I hope that some advance can be made that will satisfy representative groups as well as constitutional requirements.  However, I must await the outcome of the examination before it will be possible to say whether any change to the existing provision is legally practicable.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the Bill, as it relates to people with disabilities, represents an important step towards ensuring that people with disabilities will in future be able to exercise their right to participate on an equal basis with other employees in the world of work.  Research shows that households headed by people who are unable to work, due to illness or disability, are one of the groups in our society most likely to <Col N="326" /> encounter poverty and experience basic deprivation. It is estimated that the unemployment rate for people with disabilities in this country is as high as 80 per cent.  There are a variety of reasons for this unacceptably high level of unemployment among people with disabilities.  I hope the protection offered by this Bill, when it becomes law, will have a positive impact in reducing this figure and in increasing the awareness among employers of the availability of a highly motivated and reliable cadre of actual and potential employees, whose disabilities are entirely incidental to their value as responsible and effective workers.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, outlaws discrimination, not only against people with disabilities, but against eight other categories of people.  More than 20 years ago, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, outlawed discrimination against women.  These Acts, arising from developments in EU labour law directives, sought to bring about a change for the better in the behaviour of employers, mainly towards women employees.  The Acts have helped to change the shape and nature of the workforce in a fundamental way.</P>
    <P>We are again witnessing a qualitative shift in the nature of EU provision in the area of social protection.  The draft Amsterdam Treaty gives the Community a clear basis for acting to combat discrimination, both in employment and in the provision of goods, facilities and services, on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.  This Bill will in time improve the position of other groups in the workforce, including people with disabilities, members of the traveller community, older workers, people of minority races and other groups covered by the Bill.  Equal status legislation, which is due for publication later this year, will provide protection on the same nine grounds for discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities.</P>
    <P>The draft Amsterdam Treaty also enshrines significant new provisions which will impact positively on the development of gender equality at work.  In addition to provision for equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, a right already enshrined in Article 119 of the existing treaty, specific and broadly framed provision is made, for the first time, for the adoption of measures to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women.  There is also provision for measures which give particular advantages to one sex to help overcome disadvantage in working life or to make it easier for that sex to pursue a vocational activity.  This provision gives clear recognition to the concept of positive action at the level of the treaty and is geared to address the confusion that has existed about the legality and scope for such measures, since European Court of Justice judgments in the Kalanke and Marschall cases. Following ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, <Col N="327" /> the Commission can be expected to bring forward proposals for the codification of EU law in the area of positive action.</P>
    <P>Allied with these developments at EU level, there is evidence of a marked shift in labour market policies towards enhancing women's participation in the labour market on an equal basis. The Luxembourg Jobs Summit of 21 November 1997 took an important step in this regard by making the promotion of equal opportunities between women and men one of the four pillars of the 1998 guidelines for employment.  The three other pillars are boosting entrepreneurship, enhancing the employability of the unemployed and creating an adaptable workforce.  A significant element in Ireland's employment policies between now and the year 2000 will be the development of a national infrastructure for childcare.  Partnership 2000 commits the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to developing a strategy for the delivery of childcare with other interests and to devising a national framework for the development of the childcare sector.  Work has commenced on this project and it is expected to be completed during the life of the partnership.</P>
    <P>These developments are taking place EU wide against a backdrop of demographic projections for Europe which show an ageing population profile well into the next century.  An EU Commission report in 1997 predicted that, from about 2010 onwards, the proportion of those in the higher age range of the working population aged 55 to 64 years would exceed those aged 20 to 29 years.  With a declining working age population, it is clear that there will be more employment opportunities in the labour market and that increasing numbers of these opportunities will be taken by women.</P>
    <P>The process is already in train.  During the past 25 years there has been massive growth in the numbers of women in the workforce.  Between 1971 and 1996, the number of women in the workplace increased by 212,000, reaching 488,000 in 1996.  The growth in the number of women at work has accelerated in recent years.  For example, the growth in women in the workplace in the five years between 1991 and 1996, at 102,000, almost equalled the growth of women's employment in the previous 20 years.  The most recent labour force survey published by the Central Statistics Office in October last year estimates that the number of women at work exceeded 512,000.  Women now account for four out of every ten people at work.</P>
    <P>These changes are particularly marked in the case of married women.  In 1971, only 14 per cent of the women in the workforce were married. Today, approximately half the female workforce is married.  These changes have brought about a significant shift in the structure of the world of work and have led to a growing awareness of the need to reconcile work and family life, to safeguard competitiveness and the effectiveness of <Col N="328" /> enterprises, while permitting both women and men to devote a sufficient amount of time to their family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>While women have steadily increased their participation in the workforce, they have not been equally successful in attaining positions at the higher levels of the professions or in the organisations in which they work.  For example, in 1994 women represented 35 per cent of medical and 46 per cent of dental staff in health boards, but only 20 per cent of medical consultants employed by the health boards were women.  There is also a continuing trend for women to congregate in the professions and industrial sectors where low pay has traditionally been the norm.</P>
    <P>The challenge now is to put in place measures that will help women to build on the gains they have already secured in the labour market.  This Bill will encourage a more proactive approach to tackling the present segregation of women in the labour market which, as we have seen, occurs both on a sectoral basis and vertically within sectors. The new Equality Authority has been charged in the Bill with statutory powers to conduct equality audits, both in employment generally and in particular sectors, so that progress towards equality can be reviewed and action plans put in place to achieve equal opportunities. I would like to see these powers utilised to foster a consciousness among good employers of the need to work towards equal opportunities in practice.  The Bill will also allow employers, who wish to do so, to put in place positive action measures geared towards the removal of existing inequalities which affect women's opportunities for access to employment, training and promotion.</P>
    <P>A key issue addressed in this Bill is the question of age discrimination.  Traditionally, this kind of discrimination has been a feature of the labour market.  A brief perusal of the &ldquo;situations vacant&rdquo; section of our daily papers will confirm that many firms have a strong preference for recruiting younger workers.  There may have been a sound underlying rationale for this preference in a society where skill lasted a lifetime and recruitment to a big commercial or public service institution offered a &ldquo;job for life&rdquo;.  Structural change that has been taking place in the labour market no longer supports such unthinking discrimination, either on grounds of economics or natural justice.</P>
    <P>The world of work is changing out of all recognition. The pace of this change is fast and can be expected to gather momentum.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's White Paper on Human Resource Development estimates that in ten years' time 80 per cent of today's technology will have been replaced but 80 per cent of today's employees will still be in the workforce.  The growth areas for employment will be in labour intensive services and in knowledgebased, high-tech sectors such as telecommunications, software and data processing.  The inescapable fact is that workers today are more likely to <Col N="329" /> face redundancy and the task of re-integration into the workforce than would have been the case a generation ago.  The interests of social justice dictate that older workers should not continue to suffer systematic disadvantage in the labour market as a result of the application of outmoded or discriminatory criteria for selection for employment or training.  One important policy aim of the Bill is to change this kind of behaviour in the interest of social justice as well as from a public policy perspective.</P>
    <P>Age barriers to employment are EU-wide.  The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has identified age barriers to employment in a number of EU member states.  Some member states with population profiles older than ours have begun to rethink traditional policies that have tended to regard workers over 50, or even younger, as expendable. As a result, there is a growing recognition that older workers often represent highly skilled labour and valuable know-how.  The research supports the view that these workers form a large pool of experienced, reliable and flexible employees.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in Ireland to have an educated and well motivated working population. Irish people have shown themselves to be innovative, hardworking and determined to succeed in whatever enterprise they are engaged.  Success in today's increasingly competitive international, commercial arena involves making the fullest use of the talents of all employees, without regard to work irrelevant characteristics such as age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, religion or race. Enterprises that succeed in tapping the talents and skills of capable and flexible workers will inevitably succeed and have more talent at their disposal.  Enterprises which ignore the skills of some workers, because of a traditional world view and outdated concepts of human resource management and motivation, may find themselves falling behind, resulting in the enterprise and its employees ultimately suffering the consequences.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need for economic success we must consider the consequences of marginalisation. Employment equality legislation is one important way in which we can help redress disadvantage. I am aware this Bill alone will not eliminate inequality or create a perfect society overnight.  That task will require proactive measures over a longer period.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill is a key initiative in the development of a more equal society.  It also lays down a marker for the future.  Today we are addressing these issues in the realm of employment only, but we are working towards bringing forward a new Equal Status Bill later in the year which will address the whole question of equality of opportunity in a much wider context.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into seven Parts as follows: Part I contains standard and technical provisions; Part II sets out the prohibited discriminatory grounds and establishes the scope of the Bill; Part III deals with discrimination on grounds of gender <Col N="330" /> and gives effect to EU law in this area; Part IV deals with discrimination on the eight grounds other than gender; Part V provides for the establishment of the Equality Authority which will subsume the present Employment Equality Agency; Part VI provides for equality reviews and action plans and for a review of legislation by the Equality Authority; Part VII provides means of redress and compensation for persons who may have suffered discrimination.</P>
    <P>Part I, comprising sections 1 to 5, provides in section 2 for definitions, the powers to make orders and regulations in section 3, expenses in section 4, and repeal of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 in section 5.</P>
    <P>Part II, comprises sections 6 to 17.  Section 6 sets out the grounds on which discrimination is prohibited.  The scope of the Bill is also established in this Part.  Section 8 outlaws discrimination in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, training or experience, promotion or re-grading or classification of posts. Section 10 prohibits the publication or display of discriminatory job advertisements.  Section 11 prohibits discrimination by employment agencies. Section 12 prohibits discrimination by providers of vocational training.  Section 13 prohibits discrimination by trades unions, employer organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and by any body which controls entry to or the carrying on of a profession, vocation or occupation. The procurement or attempted procurement of discrimination is prohibited by section 14.  The extent of the liability of an employer or other person for actions of employees and other agents is set out in section 15.</P>
    <P>Part III, comprising sections 18 to 27, deals with discrimination on the gender ground and gives effect to EU law in this area.  Sections 19 and 20 provide an entitlement to men and women to equal remuneration in respect of like work where both are employed by the same or an associated employer.  Discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment is prohibited in sections 21 and 22.  Section 23 contains a definition of sexual harassment and explicitly provides that sexual harassment amounts to discrimination.</P>
    <P>Section 24 allows for positive action to eliminate the effects of past discrimination.  It is a broadly couched provision and may be interpreted to include all forms of positive action, subject only to any limitation imposed by European Court of Justice case law.  Sections 25 to 27 allow exemptions from the principle of equal treatment. These exemptions include an exemption for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; an exemption for certain jobs abroad; an exemption for special advantageous treatment of women in connection with pregnancy, maternity and adoption; an exemption for personal services, such as the care of an elderly or incapacitated person. There are limited exemptions for the Garda Síochána and the prison service for purposes <Col N="331" /> related to privacy and decency; the control of violent individuals and riot situations; and for gender-based height requirements.</P>
    <P>Part IV, consisting of sections 28 to 37, prohibits discrimination on any of the grounds, other than the gender ground, covered by the Bill. Sections 29 to 31 provide for equal pay for like work and for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment. Section 32 outlaws harassment in employment, on the basis of each of the discriminatory grounds set out in this Part.  Section 33 allows positive action in favour of people with disabilities, people above the age of 50 and members of the traveller community.  Section 34 allows for the retention by employees of certain family and seniority related benefits that would otherwise be made unlawful under the Bill.  It allows for the continued fixing of retirement ages and the phasing out of age related pay.  The section also permits the setting of a maximum recruitment age, on trainingrelated cost grounds, and for an exemption from the terms of the Bill where there is clear actuarial or other evidence of significantly increased costs for the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is focused primarily to require an employer to make special provision for a person with a disability, provided that such provision would not give rise to a cost other than a nominal cost to the employer.  Section 36 allows for the continued application of residency, citizenship and Irish language proficiency requirements in the public service and establishes criteria for setting educational and other qualifications.</P>
    <P>Section 37 allows exemptions from the principle of equal treatment.  The exemptions are for religious, educational and medical institutions run by religious bodies; for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; for jobs in circumstances abroad where people of a particular religion or race could not reasonably be expected to operate effectively; for employment in a private household and for the security forces on the age and disability grounds.</P>
    <P>Part V, consisting of sections 38 to 65, subsumes the Employment Equality Agency into the new Equality Authority which is established by section 38.  Section 39 outlines the functions of the authority, which include, <i>inter alia</i>, working towards the elimination of discrimination and promotion of equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>Sections 40 to 50 deal with the appointment of the chairperson, vice-chairperson and ordinary members of the board of the authority; the arrangements for meetings and business of the authority; the appointment of the chief executive officer and staff of the authority and some standard general provisions for the operation of the authority.  Sections 51 to 53 deal with the accounts and audit of the authority, annual reports and the grants and borrowing powers of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 54 empowers the authority, following appropriate consultation, to develop codes of practice for the elimination of discrimination and <Col N="332" /> the promotion of equality of opportunities in employment.  The new codes of practice will be admissible in evidence and taken into account in determining any relevant case.  Section 55 empowers the authority to engage in research and information activities.  Sections 56 to 65 provide that the authority may conduct an inquiry into discrimination and related matters.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, consisting of sections 66 to 71, gives a new statutory power to the authority to carry out equality reviews and devise action plans, sections 67-70, and to review equality legislation, section 71.  Part VII, consisting of sections 72 to 103, deals with procedures for resolving disputes in relation to entitlements under the Bill. In an effort to assist in the speedy and informal resolution of disputes, section 76 allows for binding mediation in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 75 is one of the key provisions of this Part.  It provides that a person who considers that she or he has been discriminated against, victimised or has not received equal remuneration may, in the first instance, refer the matter to the Director of Equality Investigations, with provision for an appeal to the Labour Court.  In the case of a dismissal, the case would be referred directly to the Labour Court, with provision for an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The other key provision is section 80 which allows the director or the court to order an employer to pay up to three years' arrears of remuneration or to order compensation for other acts of discrimination or victimisation up to a maximum of 104 weeks' remuneration.  In a case where the person concerned was not in receipt of remuneration, there is provision for an order for compensation up to a maximum of £10,000.  In a case involving the dismissal of an employee, the Labour Court may also order reinstatement or reengagement of the employee, if that is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Arising from recent European Court of Justice case law, the possibility of compensation without limit has been provided for in substantiated gender equality cases.  A person who may have been discriminated against on this ground may opt to seek redress through the Circuit Court.  In such a case, the only limit on the amount of compensation or arrears of remuneration which may be ordered is a six years' time limit on the backdating of any compensation or arrears of remuneration, section 80(3).  This limit on backdating is the maximum such limit enshrined in the generally applicable Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>Sections 74 and 79 provide a right to seek information for all persons who may have been discriminated against and set out the consequences for an employer for failure to supply such information. Sections 92 to 95 give investigative powers to the Director of Equality Investigations and to the Labour Court to enter premises, to obtain relevant information through interview or otherwise, to ensure compliance in the event of failure or refusal by persons to co-operate with an investigation <Col N="333" /> and to set conditions for the disclosure of information obtained through this process.</P>
    <P>Under section 83, the Equality Authority is empowered to refer disputes to the Director of Equality Investigations.  The authority may also refer a case to the director on behalf of an individual where it would not be reasonable to expect an individual to refer the case, for example, because of the complexity of the case or because of the individual's fear of victimisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue, which is of grave concern to my constituents.</P>
      <P>Since early January many people in east Waterford and surrounding areas have been without British television channels.  This is particularly hard on senior citizens and children and it is extremely inconvenient for the general public.  It is all the more galling in view of the fact that deflector systems, similar to those which were closed down by court injunction in east Waterford, are operating in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Since January, people in the east Waterford area have been awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by the director of telecommunications regulation into the future delivery of televised services in Ireland.  The recently published report is a discussion document and comments on it have been requested to be submitted by 15 April 1998.  While this process is taking place the people in east Waterford remain without a multichannel service and, worse still, there is no indication as to when, if ever, the service will be restored.  Pending the outcome of the consultative process, temporary licences should be granted where people are without a deflector service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative MMDS service available in some, but not all, of the area affected.  The service is considerably more expensive, particularly when there is more than one television set per household.  There is also difficulty if a customer wishes to watch one station while video recording another.  To make matters worse, the Kilmacthomas based deflector service group was forced off the air two weeks ago.  This means that <Col N="334" /> a large part of County Waterford has been denied its television deflector service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen to ignore this situation. That is unacceptable.  People are being penalised in a basic feature of modern life.  The Minister, in the first instance, owes my constituents clarity with regard to TV deflector services. She must further explain why TV deflector systems operate in some parts of the country and not in others.  I demand equity for my constituents in this regard.  Is the law being enforced in some areas and not in others?</P>
    <P>Pending the conclusion of the process currently taking place in the office of the director of telecommunications regulation, will the Minister introduce a system of permanent or, at least, temporary licences or instruct the director of telecommunications regulation to introduce such a system?  The State and its agencies are failing to meet the wishes of many of my constituents.  They are without the service they desire and for which they are willing to pay.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister publish a copy of the contract between her Department and Cablelink in the Waterford area?  In this era of transparency and accountability, my constituents deserve to have full knowledge of the agreement which regulates the provision of multichannel television in their area.  The Minister must take urgent action to rectify this sorry situation and have service restored. Furthermore, will the Minister outline her legislative plans in this regard?</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the strong community involvement in deflector groups throughout the country and the desire of people in the areas concerned to have access to the best possible service taking account of the technical and economic realities.  The key issue is the service provided throughout the country, particularly in rural and remote areas.  The Government favours access to a quality service for all at reasonable rates.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the legislative position is that, while the Minister for Public Enterprise has a policy role in relation to the allocation and use of the radio frequency spectrum, the legal power to issue licences to television deflector operators pursuant to section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, was transferred, with effect from 30 June 1997, to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first director, Ms Etain Doyle, was appointed in May last year.  The director's powers under the 1996 Act, including the power to licence deflector systems under section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, were transferred on 30 June 1997.  It is, accordingly, a legal function of the director to address the question of <Col N="335" /> licensing such operators.  Any licensing regulations proposed by the director would be subject to the Minister's consent.  To implement a licensing scheme, regulations would have to be brought forward by the director under section 6 of the 1926 Act prescribing the form, duration, terms or conditions, fees, etc.  for such licences.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the director initiated a consultancy study of this matter with a view to determining the appropriate course of action.  The purpose of the study was to provide information on future options for the delivery of television services in the context of the development of digital technology.  The director has recently issued the report on this study with a view to opening a public debate on the issues involved.  I understand the director intends to finalise the consultation process in April with a view to coming to final conclusions towards the summer.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the director's independence and the perception of that independence to the successful development of the telecommunications sector, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to speculate on or be seen to attempt to influence in any way the proper discharge of the director's functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will be able to convince the Minister of State, a fellow Corkman who is well aware of the situation in Cobh, that the case I am about to make has merit and that action should be taken to ensure a swimming pool is provided in east Cork.  As he is well aware, Cork is the largest county in Ireland and Cobh is the largest town in the county.  According to the 1996 census, the population of the Cobh Urban District Council area is 6,500.  The population of the rural part of the island is 2,000, giving a total population of 8,500.</P>
      <P>On the question of running costs, I understand the findings of a feasibility study have been forwarded to the Department.  They demonstrate that the project would be self-financing.  To be self-financing a swimming pool has to be located in an area with a large population.  East Cork includes the towns of Midleton and Youghal and, according to the 1996 census, has a population of more than 41,000.  There is a great need for a public swimming pool in the area.  Following the opening of the magnificent new road earlier this year, Midleton is less than 20 minutes drive from Cobh.  People living in Crosshaven and Carrigaline on the opposite side of the harbour can travel to Cobh with great ease via the cross river ferry.</P>
      <P>The old swimming pool in Cobh was closed to the public in 1991 because of safety considerations. Planning for the new pool commenced in that year and there have been ongoing discussions and negotiations with the Department since.  All the relevant documentation was finally submitted last October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> The people of Cobh are not asking the Department to fund the total cost of the project.  A site has been provided and over £350,000 is in the bank.  The proposed site is adjacent to most of the schools in the town.  It is also planned to provide a gymnasium.  This means the facility would be used to the maximum extent by schoolchildren during the day and the wider community in the evening and at weekends.  This would ensure maximum value for money.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree our young people need to be involved in as many physical activities as possible to ensure a healthy lifestyle, enhance their self-esteem and provide alternatives to drugs and crime.  Investment in swimming pools and sport in general will, in the long run, help to reduce the need for investment in prisons.  Millions of pounds have been spent on Spike Island prison which the young people of Cobh can see across the harbour.  All they ask is that a fraction of this be spent on a swimming pool in Cobh.  The law-abiding deserve the same treatment as the law-breakers.  The people of Cobh and east Cork have waited long enough.  I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on my request and take action as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is unable to be present and has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Department pays grants of up to 100 per cent of the approved cost of refurbishing existing swimming pools and up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of new pools, with the remainder being funded by local contribution.  To qualify for a grant the proposal must comply with the standards set out in the Department's Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines.  The Department will also consider grant-aiding up to 80 per cent of the cost of modest ancillary facilities such as saunas, steam rooms as part of a proposal.</P>
      <P>The commitment of funds to a particular project can only be considered when the project design has been approved and the local authority is in a position to accept the tender.  The overall allocation for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other swimming pool projects for the available funds must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The provision for the swimming pool programme in 1998 is £4 million which is fully committed to projects under construction or which have been fully approved by the Department and on which work is expected to commence later this year.  These projects will give rise to spending commitments of £3.7 million in 1999.  The Department has over £44 million worth of projects at various stages of planning which will be competing for funding in coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> The swimming pool in Cobh which was built in 1975 had developed serious problems by 1985.  A report commissioned by the local authority recommended that substantial works be carried out on the pool plant and also highlighted building problems such as corrosion of the pre-cast concrete frame and leaking from the flat roof areas.  The pool was closed to the public in 1991 and since then has suffered the effects of vandalism.</P>
    <P>In 1994 Cobh Urban District Council invited proposals from interested parties for the redevelopment and operation of the swimming pool.  No suitable proposal emerged from this exercise.  In 1995 the council decided to undertake the refurbishment of the pool and engaged consultants to ascertain the full extent of the works required. The consultants' report, which was accepted by the council, recommended the total demolition of the pool building and the development of a new complex on the same site.</P>
    <P>Preliminary proposals for the Cobh swimming pool project were approved by the Department in July 1996 at an estimated cost of £1.71 million. Cobh Urban District Council subsequently submitted contract documents to the Department in October 1997.  These are under examination by the Department's inspectorate.  The current estimated cost of the project is £2.3 million, requiring grant aid of approximately £1.84 million from the Department if it is to proceed.  The balance, approximately £460,000, is to be met by way of local contribution.</P>
    <P>The question of an actual commitment to this or any other swimming pool project would not normally fall to be considered until contract documents and, subsequently, tenders have been approved by the Department.  Having regard to the high level of demand for funding for swimming pools and the limited funds available, it is not possible to indicate when funding will be available for this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  Until recently, unemployment assistance was paid manually to people.  However, the new system of paying by cheque has created problems in many households.</P>
      <P>The basic principle behind this new system is good in that people are no longer required to present themselves at unemployment offices.  It is also in line with my party's policy to introduce a guaranteed basic income.  It provides an alternative to the apartheid which exists in our society between claimants and those with tax free allowances who do not have to present themselves at unemployment offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious mistake was made in not introducing this new system without these delays.  The effect of the change is to turn the advance cash payment into a retrospective payment.  Last Tuesday, for <Col N="338" /> example, there was no money for those who normally get paid on that day.  All such payments will now be one week in arrears, although the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will say that no one is losing money.</P>
    <P>This problem is in stark contrast to the customer friendly policy advocated under the strategic management initiative.  Customers are told to borrow money until cheques are sent a week later.  However, if they do this they will always be a week in arrears as they will need to pay the money back with the following week's cheque. This is a shoddy way to manage the money on which people depend.</P>
    <P>The Department will benefit from this new streamlined system as it will require fewer staff and less security as there will be fewer cash payments. However, the customer will be forced to turn to moneylenders and that is a serious indictment of the State.  I contrast that with what pensioners were offered in the past couple of years to encourage them to change from a cash to a cheque system.  I am not sure of the full details, but I understand they were offered prize bonds. Incentives were provided so that people would feel happy about changing rather than being penalised.  That proves the Department recognised the problems associated with changing from a cash to a cheque payment system.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the only one who can restore the caring reputation epitomised by the Department's logo.  That logo is an insult to those who have been told they will not get any money this week and that they must wait until the cheque is posted to them next week.  That gives the impression the Department is more interested in streamlining its operation and cutting back on costs.  It is computerising its operation at the expense of defenceless and vulnerable people.  Its customer friendly policy is a hollow one.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a 50 per cent payment offer.  I ask the Minister to ensure that payments are not made in arrears and that people are allowed to claim some money to get them through the current week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the situation in this regard.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to a system of payment of unemployment benefit and assistance.  These payments are made through a network of departmental and branch offices.  A new computer system for unemployment, sickness and other short-term payment &mdash; the ISTS system &mdash; is in the process of being implemented. All departmental offices are now operating this system and we are currently in the process of extending the system to the branch office network. Connection to this system represents a significant advance in the service that the branch offices can offer our customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the new system, claimants are no longer paid in cash but will generally receive payment <Col N="339" /> at post offices.  This is a more secure payment system for staff and customers and provides the opportunity for my Department to offer added value services to customers, such as the facility for deductions to be made under the successful household budgeting scheme.  An additional benefit is that customers now have to sign only once every four weeks instead of every week.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of customers in branch offices the switch over to the new computer system has no impact other than the change from payment in cash to payment in post offices.  For customers generally there is no delay in their payment arising from the changeover.  One group of customers, however, namely those engaged in casual employment for part of the week and in receipt of unemployment assistance for the balance of the week, are subject to some disruption of payment in the process of the changeover.  This arises because each week these customers must declare the days they worked in the previous week.  Under the previous system customers declared each week when they signed on the days worked in the previous week and payment was computed and paid on that basis.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangement the details of working patterns are posted in by the customers and are then entered on the computer system for payment.  This can cause some delay during the changeover period for the small number of people involved.  In no case could the period of delay exceed seven days.  The Deputy's motion refers to a period of 14 to 21 days.  If the Deputy is aware of delays longer than seven days, perhaps he could bring them to my attention.  In Balbriggan 1,600 cases were put live on the ISTS system, of which 80 were unemployment assistance casual cases to which we referred.  They were all informed by letter of the change in payment and of the date of the next payment.  Only two people requested the application for the special arrangements to cover the week's delay because they had no employment that week.</P>
    <P>The difficulty this could cause in certain cases has been recognised and arrangements were offered to all such customers to have 50 per cent of their unemployment payment paid to them by special manual payment in advance and the balance paid by cheque the following week.  If there are particular difficulties in any case, the Department tries to deal with them in a sympathetic way.</P>
    <P>The customers in question generally have income from their employment and most have opted to wait for payment without availing of the special arrangement.  The new system of payment, when fully operational, will represent a considerable improvement in the level of service for customers and a more efficient system of payment, particularly by the branch offices throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister of State.  I will be brief and to the point. I would like him to answer the following questions. Was the Department consulted by the Sisters of Charity teaching order of their intention to close this school and, if so, when did such consultations commence?  Has the Department any say in whether the school closes?  Is the Minister of State aware there is a shortage of primary school places in the area covered by the operation of this school?  Is he also aware that in l994 the same school authorities at national level chose to close a primary school, which was a feeder school for this secondary girls' school, but gave a clear indication to parents at the time that the secondary school was not under threat?  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the Department has any lien on the school by virtue of the substantial grants that would have been available to it over time?  Is it possible the Sisters of Charity, who have performed an excellent service for this community over many years and who have needs of their own and other priorities, could depart from the school, if that is their absolute choice, but that the school could continue to operate as a secondary school?</P>
      <P>There are concerns about the closure of this school.  The school is in an area where parents cannot get a primary school place for their children. There have been some primary school closures in this area in recent years and new Gaelscoileanna have opened because of that shortage. There is a shortage of second level school places and this second level school with a good reputation is in the process of being closed.</P>
      <P>There is a meeting tonight of the concerned parents of St. Anne's Secondary School and, as was the case in 1994, those parents and the prospective parents of children who might attend that secondary school want to know how we can reconcile those two things at the same time. Nobody disputes the right of the sisters, if they so choose, to move out of this educational activity and, if necessary, to use the proceeds of this school to look after the needs of the elderly members of their community.  If that is the motivation for exiting from the school, the State should consider ways that legitimate and real need can be addressed, but the satisfaction of that need should not be at the expense of an absolutely essential educational infrastructural facility in a part of this city where the population is increasing. The perception is that is not the case, but the boundary revisions for the Dáil constituencies published today show that Dublin South-East has lost territory because of the intensification of population within it.  It is in this area, which is subject to intensive infill development, that there is a need for such a school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents were not properly treated in 1994 by the authorities in the school and were not given the full facts.  It was only through a process of extensive negotiation and discussion with the <Col N="341" /> Department of Education that we were able to get details of what was happening for the parents.</P>
    <P>The point at issue is whether this decision is irrevocable.  If so, can the educational facility be retained for some other organisation which might provide a second level school?  If it can, what kind of leverage or power does the Department of Education and Science have to ensure that the facilities of St. Anne's Secondary School, which have been put in place with the assistance of taxpayers' money over many years, can be retained as an educational facility and the understandable needs of the order of the Sisters of Charity in relation to the pastoral care they have to provide for their ageing community can be addressed in a different way?  That would ensure the legitimate needs of those people can be looked after and the rights of parents and the opportunities for school children to get a second level education in this area can also be facilitated.</P>
    <P>I know the numbers of students in the school have dropped and those figures have probably been given to the Department, but they have fallen largely because of the closure of the feeder primary school and a certain question mark over the future of this school continuing as a secondary school.  The Minister of State may not be directly familiar with the area, but I emphasis there is a serious crisis concerning the number of school places at primary level and this will be compounded at secondary level where there is also a crisis, particularly in respect of non-fee paying schools.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for raising this issue and I hope my reply will answer the questions he raised.  If there is anything he is unsure about, I will undertake to communicate with him.</P>
      <P>St. Anne's Secondary School, Milltown, is an all girls school with an enrolment of 295 pupils in the current school year.  The trustees of the school, the Sisters of Charity, informed my Department by letter dated 8 March l998 that they had reluctantly decided to close the school. This decision has been taken following discussions with the board of management, staff and parents' council.  The letter indicated the school would be closed on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> The reason given for the decision to close is that the trustees consider the future viability of the school will become increasingly untenable due to declining enrolments.  Ten years ago the school had an overall enrolment of 531 pupils with an intake of close to 100 new pupils that year.  The corresponding figures for l997 were 295 and 36 respectively.  A continuation of this level of pupil intake would result in an overall enrolment of less than 200 in a few years' time.  A consequence of the declining enrolment is that the number of teachers in the school is also reducing and the school is not in a position to continue to provide a full range of subject options.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a secondary school is a privately owned and managed institution and a decision to close such a school is a matter for the trustees.  The Department's main concern in a school closure is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after.  A closure must take place on a phased basis so that the existing pupils are adequately catered for in the period leading up to closure.  Allied to this there would need to be sufficient pupil places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.</P>
    <P>The trustees informed my Department today that there will be no intake of first year pupils next September.  It was also indicated that all 25 pupils on the enrolment list for next September have already obtained places in other schools. Negotiations regarding the phasing out period are ongoing between the trustees on the one hand and the board of management, teachers and parents on the other.  When these negotiations are completed, the final closing date for the school will be announced.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities to ensure that as little disruption as possible is caused to all concerned by the closure of the school.  I will undertake to look into the other points raised by him and we will write to him about them during the coming week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 66, 74 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>This Government's priority is to continue to improve the co-ordination of changes in the tax and social welfare systems to remove disincentives to take up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, the December budget was <Col N="345" /> the first salvo in our battle to cut taxes.  The standard rate of income tax was cut from 26 per cent to 24 per cent while the top rate comes down from 48 per cent to 46 per cent.  Changes in PRSI mean that an extra 60,000 workers pay no PRSI but still qualify for benefits while almost two thirds of industrial, commercial and service sector jobs are now at the low rate of PRSI.</P>
    <P>These changes are important in terms of improving living standards generally but also in terms of providing an incentive to return to work. Also in the December budget we introduced new initiatives and further developed existing policies and instruments, which are specifically targeted at assisting the long-term unemployed into jobs.</P>
    <P>A significant element of this focused approach is the introduction of a two part initiative which provides a special tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000, plus £1,000 for each child and a double tax deduction for wages for employers who employ the long-term unemployed person.  Participants will retain their secondary benefits.  This allowance will be an alternative to other existing back-to-work incentives.</P>
    <P>What this initiative does is that it adds to the range of options available to the long-term unemployed returning to the labour market on the one hand while, on the other hand it can make it more attractive to potential employers to take on a long-term unemployed person.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include an increase of 5,000 places, in 1998, on the back to work allowance scheme, the extension of the area based allowance to the entire country, an additional 1,000 places on the part-time jobs option and 1,000 places on the jobs initiative.  In addition, on the basis of a commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate entitlement to the family income supplement on a net rather than a gross income basis, this Government has completed this process by removing income tax from the basis of assessment with effect from October next.  Moreover, the current family income thresholds are being increased by £7 per week from June.  As a result, the average weekly payment for existing FIS claimants will rise by £11 to £50.</P>
    <P>The combination of fiscal initiatives, the extension and enhancement of in-work benefits and the increased number of places on active labour market programmes have as their overriding objective the removal of disincentives to work.  I fail to see how our approach can be interpreted as making the journey from welfare to work harder.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the negotiations leading to Partnership 2000, a high level group which was representative of Departments, the social partners and the industrial promotion agencies was established to consider proposals for dispute resolution in relation to the issue of trade union recognition. That group submitted a report to me as it was required to do under paragraph 9.22 of Partnership 2000.  The social partners have indicated that they would like discussion of the matter to continue and it has been decided that the parties will work together to finalise their report.  In that context, the dispute at Ryanair and the report of the inquiry team into that dispute will provide further material for reflection on the topic.  As I have stated in reply to a separate question, that dispute is sensitive and complex and I do not consider it appropriate to impose time deadlines on the work of the inquiry team.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, 17, 54, 55, 57 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the comprehensive reply which I gave to the House on 18 February last, regarding the wide-ranging discussions taking place on the draft life assurance transparency regulations with insurance industry representatives, consumer interests and other relevant experts in this field.  It is my intention to seek to finalise the discussions and enact the regulations as quickly as possible.  I am glad to have the opportunity to restate the broad outline and prime objectives in introducing a transparency regime, governing the marketing and sale of life assurance products.</P>
      <P>The objective in introducing life assurance transparency regulations will be to provide the consumer, as of legal right, with understandable pre-contractual and post-contractual information, on essential features and key areas, associated with the purchasing of a life assurance product.</P>
      <P>The prime objectives in the formulation of such a regime are: an end to over-complication in the presentation of such products; the minimisation of mis-selling and confusion; adoption of realistic investment projections, where relevant; transparency on charges and expenses; a knowledge of with whom the insurance consumer is dealing; and adequate redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of life assurance transparency regulations is necessitated by the failure of the insurance industry to adapt and respond to the growing demand by insurance consumers for reasonable disclosure by suppliers of life assurance of the risks and benefits associated with purchasing life assurance products.</P>
      <P>The insurance ombudsman has consistently referred to the dissatisfaction expressed by complainants over surrender values of policies and to the fact that many complaints occur because of poor communication, lack of understanding of information at the time that a policy is purchased and misunderstandings in relation to &ldquo;nil-allocation&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-investment&rdquo; in assurance and investment policies in the early years.</P>
      <P>The insurance ombudsman also pointed out that there was an onus on prospective purchasers of life assurance policies to take care to read and understand the policy documentation themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> My discussions and our Department's continued interaction with relevant parties have focused on the effect which charges, including commissions and sales remuneration, can have in reducing the amount of the premium available for investment, especially in the early years and on the surrender value and maturity value of the insurance policy.</P>
    <P>My objective is to have all charges and deductions from the premium payment disclosed at the outset in a way that will enable the policyholder to readily establish, taking all charges into account, the real return on the gross premium investment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the efficacy of introducing separate identification of commission payments within the statement of total charges, our Department has been seeking to devise, in consultation with the insurance industry, a workable formula for calculating the equivalent of commission component sales remuneration in direct sales of life assurance products.  The disclosure requirements must be framed in a way which avoids unfairly discriminating between the commission payments to independent brokers and other insurance intermediaries and the remuneration packages of direct salesforce employed by the insurers themselves, or through tied agents, such as banks and building societies.  The process of devising a satisfactory formula for computing commission equivalent in direct sales is a difficult and complex undertaking.  Whatever formula is devised, must be soundly based in order to provide meaningful and accurate information to the policyholder, as to how much of the total deductions from the premium in purchasing a life insurance policy, from a direct salesperson, can be directly compared to the commission charge of the policy, were it to be purchased through a broker.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations are aimed at informing any person who proposes directly to an insurer, or indirectly through an insurance intermediary to purchase a life assurance product.  It is proposed that all suppliers of life assurance must supply to the customer before he or she signs a proposal or application form information, in writing in a clear, prominent and accurate manner, as prescribed in the draft regulations.  The information will include full details of the supplier of life assurance, including the legal form of the insurer's name, the regulatory authority granted to the insurer or intermediary, and details of the nature of the relationship between the insurer and the intermediary.</P>
    <P>Information shall be provided, in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy including: (i) information on the benefits and options available to the proposer and the laws applicable to the contract; (ii) the circumstances under which the contract may be cancelled by either party and the arrangements for application of the cooling-off period; which will remain at 15 days as heretofore; (iii) the means of calculation and distribution of bonuses and a statement of the units to which the benefits are <Col N="350" /> linked and the assets underlying unit-linked policies; (iv) the arrangements for handling disputes about the life assurance policy, including the option of recourse to the insurance ombudsman service; (v) the purpose and intention of the policy, that is whether it is a protection or savings policy, or a combination of both; (vi) the type of policy for example, regular premium savings or single premium investment, regular or single premium pension, whether critical illness cover or permanent health insurance is included and whether policies are index-linked; (vii) the long-term nature of the policy and the level of monetary commitment given in that regard; (viii) a statement outlining the cost of the insurance policy and the means and duration of payment of premiums; (ix) a prominent statement indicating whether the policy acquires a surrender or early encashment value and the consequences of cessation of payment of premiums; (x) a prominent statement indicating that early surrender of the policy, whether through non-payment of premiums or voluntarily, may result in a surrender value which is less than the aggregate of the premiums paid up to the date of surrender.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also provide that information shall be made available to the policyholder during the term of the insurance contract, related to any change in the name, legal form, address, branch name or address of the insurer.</P>
    <P>Widespread support has been received from all parties concerned, including the Consumers Association of Ireland, for the provision to the policyholder of a tabular statement showing for each of the years one to five and every five years thereafter up to maturity the premium payment, the total deductions in respect of all charges and expenses, including commissions, the cumulative value of the investment at illustrative rates of return and the surrender value for early encashment. The tabular statement will be the key element of the new disclosure regime and will provide the policyholder with clear and comprehensive information at the outset and it is intended that it will be updated on an annual basis, throughout the policy term.  Allied to the table will be a number of prominent health warnings, indicating essential features and some of the risks associated with the policy, notably the effects of early surrender, the illustrative nonguaranteed nature of the rates of return, premium reviews where premium is not guaranteed to provide benefits or returns illustrated, taxation arrangements, long-term nature of the policy and service fees.</P>
    <P>It is intended to make it an offence for any supplier of insurance who knowingly or recklessly, makes a false or deceitful statement or dishonestly conceals material facts in order to induce a customer to take out a policy of insurance, or who gives a false or misleading impression as to the value of a policy of insurance in terms of its prospective investment performance and-or surrender value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> It should be stressed that the proposals as outlined not only supplement minimum life assurance policyholder disclosure requirements under EU law, but also greatly exceed them in terms of effectiveness, clarity and overall content.  The regulations should also bring about a level of consistency across the insurance industry, in so far as consumer protection is concerned and indeed act as a catalyst to encourage other competing financial services providers to institute comparable transparency measures.  I should stress that, in accordance with my area of responsibility, the present proposals are in respect of life insurance products only.  They do not address non-insurance investment products marketed and sold by other financial services institutions.  It is a matter for other financial services regulators to decide whether a need exists for greater transparency across the range of comparable investment products, including disclosure of intermediaries' remuneration.</P>
    <P>To date, I have taken no final decision on these matters and I will only be in a position to do so when the current discussions and consultations have been concluded.</P>

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself regarding predictions that entering the euro without Britain could put approximately 100,000 Irish jobs at risk; and the plans, if any, she has made to protect the competitiveness of Irish exports in the event of a significant fall in sterling against the euro.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney) Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some recent reports and commentators have eluded to significant job losses in the event of a serious depreciation in sterling post EMU. Depending on the report or commentator involved the estimates of possible job losses fluctuate within a wide range.  While I am unaware of the source of the Deputy's estimate I suspect it is towards the higher end of the scale.  These predictions are largely based on a significant depreciation of sterling whereas the current exchange rate of 82p to the Irish pound provides a substantial competitive advantage for Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>The industries in question where jobs may be most vulnerable if sterling depreciates substantially against the euro are in those sectors, mainly labour intensive, and low margin that are generally vulnerable to sterling-Irish pound exchange rate fluctuations and would be vulnerable to sterling exchange rate fluctuations irrespective of Irelands entry into EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment such exporting companies or companies competing against UK products are enjoying substantial competitive advantage through the current Irish pound-sterling exchange <Col N="352" /> rate, more so than would otherwise be the case were we not about to become members of EMU.</P>
    <P>In the longer term there is much greater commitment by the current Labour Government in the UK to the principle of EMU than was present in the last Conservative Government.  In such circumstances substantial movements in the value of sterling against the euro are less likely.</P>
    <P>In addition member states will have a significant voice in the terms on which sterling would join and they will be anxious to ensure that sterling does not gain a substantial once off competitiveness advantage by significantly depreciating before entry.</P>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's query as to what plans are in place to protect the competitiveness of Irish exporters I would like to identify the following strategies: In anticipation of EMU the ABT has been given a specific target to lessen our dependence on the UK market and to increase the proportion of our indigenous exports going to continental EU markets by 2 per cent per annum up to 1999.  Currently about a quarter of all Irish exports are sold in the UK while 41 per cent of indigenous exports are sold there; at the level of the exporter, the EMU Business Awareness Campaign is aimed primarily at small and medium enterprises and is designed to ensure that Irish business is fully prepared to meet the practical challenges of EMU.  This campaign is being co-ordinated by Forfás with full participation by An Bord Tráchtála, ABT, the national trade board; ABT which has responsibility for export promotion activities, has published an EMU guide for exporters which deals specifically with the marketing challenges and opportunities presented by EMU; ABT is also stepping up its export development programme in Europe in 1998 and will invest in excess of £10 million in support of Irish exporters in continental markets as part of a medium term strategy to increase the proportion of indigenous exports going to these markets by 1999 and as part of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign carried out by Forfás, a study has been undertaken in order to determine the actions needed by Irish firms in order to counter any possible fluctuations in the sterlingeuro exchange rate in the event of the UK remaining outside EMU.  The study is now completed, and it has identified a wide range of actions in the fields of finance, marketing, distribution, etc., that firms could consider as part of their contingency planning.  These actions will be summarized in a document to be included in the Forfás information pack prepared as part of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign to be widely distributed in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let there be no misunderstanding that each individual exporter must take responsibility for the transition to and through EMU and may have to have recourse to various strategies including: market diversification; product diversification; creating value-added; niche marketing and decreasing cost and increasing productivity.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  I can inform him that IMRO submitted a formal complaint to the European Commission, with the unanimous support of its European counterparts in the representative body GESAC pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 3286/94 concerning certain trade obstacles.  The case relates specifically to the administration and licensing of the performing right in music in the United States of America.  The IMRO case was presented to a meeting of the Commission Trade Barriers Committee, a committee established under the terms of the trade barriers regulation to facilitate representative organisations in member states of the EU to bring forward cases which identify barriers to trade outside the EU.  Ireland, which was formally represented at that meeting, fully supported the adoption and pursuit of the IMRO case.</P>
      <P>The European Commission subsequently decided to pursue this matter directly with the US authorities and will, it is understood, pursue this matter through a WTO panel if necessary.  Ireland concurs with the action being taken by the Commission.</P>
      <P>As the European Commission is now actively pursuing IMRO's complaint with the US, the provision of support by my Department does not arise.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor progress in this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 77 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The Multilateral Agreement on Investment, known as the MAI, is being negotiated under the auspices to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the OECD &mdash; in Paris.  It will be a free-standing international treaty open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations.  The deadline for completion of negotiation was April 1998.  However, it is certain that this deadline will not be met.</P>
      <P>Countries which become party to the MAI will commit themselves to treat foreign investors no less favourably than they treat their own investors. They will also agree not to discriminate among investors of different MAI parties.  In general, as long as a country does not discriminate against foreign investors, the agreement will not restrict the ability of a Government to legislate.</P>
      <P>Other important provisions will include the following: transparency of laws and regulations; the right to transfer funds to and from the host country although governments will be able to suspend this right temporarily in the event of a balance of payments or monetary crisis; the right of the investor to bring key personnel to the host country &mdash; subject to general immigration laws; the prohibition of certain performance requirements &mdash; such as minimum export targets &mdash; as a condition for allowing an investment to be set up and the right of a foreign investor to adequate and effective compensation in the event of the expropriation of property.  All of these provisions will be underpinned by a dispute resolution system both between states and between the investor and the host state.  Where countries are willing and able to implement the main thrust of the MAI but have difficulties with specific obligations, they will have the opportunity to negotiate countryspecific exceptions.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the conclusion of the MAI and expects that this country will, in due course, become a party to it.  This would allow us to give yet another important signal to foreign investors that they are welcome here.  We already treat foreign investors favourably and would not, therefore, need to make fundamental changes in order to honour our commitments.</P>
      <P>The agreement would also be of value to our outward investors in that it would allow them to compete on a level playing field in the markets of those countries which choose to become party to the MAI.  They would also benefit from the assurance that they can repatriate their profits here, employ Irish managers and specialised technicians, and have a right of fair and adequate compensation if their property in another MAI country were ever expropriated.</P>
      <P>The approval of the Dáil would be required before Ireland agreed to be bound by the terms of the MAI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000, on their particular systems and to determine the solution.  There is no way of preventing or avoiding the costs associated with solving the problem.  The level of cost in any particular case will depend on the extent of the problem.  It is important however that Irish businesses address the issue as the cost of ignoring the problem, could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem at this stage.</P>
      <P>Where the Government can help is in raising awareness of the issue and by providing guidelines to businesses, to help them tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>Approximately 100,000 copies of an awareness leaflet on the &ldquo;Year 2000&rdquo; computer problem, prepared by our Department in June 1997, with the assistance of Forfás and IBEC, have been distributed to industry, chambers of commerce and county enterprise boards, CEBs, throughout the country.  This leaflet suggests the initial steps to be taken, to enable industry's IT systems deal with the date change.</P>
      <P>Some recent research on the year 2000 problem has indicated that, while there is a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action to deal with the problem, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is required.  Accordingly, a further awareness campaign will be undertaken, with which I intend to be personally involved.  A further and more comprehensive brochure, outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about addressing, it is in an advanced stage of preparation in our Department.  This brochure will be circulated to businesses both directly and indirectly, through industrial development agencies, county enterprise boards and chambers of commerce.  In addition, a series of regional public meetings will be held to highlight awareness of the problem and, in particular, the urgency of the need to address the issue immediately.</P>
      <P>Both myself and officials of our Department have also had discussions with representatives of the financial sector, the insurance industry, the accountancy bodies and others, including the IT sector, to seek their assistance in highlighting the need for Irish businesses to take urgent action.  I will in this connection be appointing a broadly representative steering committee to oversee the awareness campaign.  I would hope to commence the campaign during the month of May.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, economic and monetary union is set to begin on 1 January 1999 when the conversion rates of the currencies participating in EMU will be irrevocably fixed against one another. Planning and preparation in Ireland is proceeding on the basis that Ireland will qualify for membership of EMU from the outset.</P>
      <P>The planning and preparation process is extensive with an intent in particular to assist the business community to be ready for the changeover. In this context, it is my view, and that of the Government, that the key to a successful transition to the euro is early preparation by the business sector.  This is a central message of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign which is managed by Forfás on behalf of my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The issue of preparation for the euro among the small business sector has been a particular focus of the Business Awareness Campaign over recent months.  A number of initiatives designed to specifically target smaller businesses have been initiated in this regard.  These include: Preparation of a short user friendly brochure summarising the key issues for small business in relation to the changeover to the Euro.  Over 73,000 copies of this brochure have been distributed to businesses through their representative organisations, state agencies, etc.  and through special distribution with, and advertising in, magazines targeted at small firms.  Relevant EMU material outlining how EMU issues should be dealt with has been distributed to over 140,000 businesses as part of a mailing with the Revenue Commissioners.  An advertising campaign on the radio has alerted businesses to the advent of the euro and the need for preparations and offered businesses the opportunity to phone a dedicated euro line for information.  A consultative committee has been formed comprising representatives from employer organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and state agencies to act as a forum for co-ordination, co-operation and information exchange.  In addition a Retail Sector Working Group has been formed whose remit is to address and make recommendations on specific issues relating to EMU and the retail sector. An Inter-agency Co-Ordination Group has been formed in order to ensure that support to enterprises from the state agencies is fully mobilised to assist them as far as possible in their preparations for EMU.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government has published its own national changeover plan outlining the arrangements that will be made by Departments, the Central Bank, the NTMA and the Revenue Commissioners as well as banks, building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange.  This will serve as a useful guide for businesses of all sizes and in all sectors as they prepare for the changeover.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore that Government plans are sufficiently advanced to facilitate the business community in its preparations for the changeover to the euro.  Continued co-operation with and preparation by the business community will, I am sure, result in the transition to the euro proceeding successfully.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that I appointed an authorised officer, on Monday last, 23 March, under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, for the purpose of obtaining further information from National Irish Bank in order to ascertain whether where relevant the operations of the National Irish Bank and its associated companies meet the requirements of the Insurance Acts and regulations and whether breaches of that legislation, may have occurred.  I have asked the authorised officer to present his report to me within two months.  The House will also be aware of the ongoing investigations being conducted, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, concerning allegations of tax evasion and by the central bank, into the operations of the bank.</P>
      <P>The decision to appoint the authorised officer, follows ministerial and departmental inquiries, from National Irish Bank and extensive and ongoing consultations between the Tanaiste and myself our departmental officials, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Attorney General's office, over the past seven weeks.  The Attorney General's office has engaged a counsel to advise, on the basis of the information provided, in response to our inquiries, whether breaches of insurance law, may have occurred, justifying the submission of the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The results of counsel's examination of issues, raised by our Department and the Chief State Solicitor's Office indicated, having regard to the complexity of the legislation involved, the need to obtain further detailed information, from National Irish Bank.  When I studied the initial information and the legal advice, it became clear that, in order to obtain the further information prescribed by counsel, the appointment of an authorised officer with statutory powers was necessary, notwithstanding the co-operation of National Irish Bank in the preliminary written inquiries.</P>
      <P>I believe that the appointment of an authorised officer to examine the NIB-CMI insurance arrangements was an appropriate response given the information available to us last Monday.  I believe that we require more information to address the insurance issues and it is my intention, as of now, that the authorised officer should continue his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, the section provides that the Minister may appoint an inspector on petition to the High Court to investigate the affairs of a company where there are circumstances suggesting that, <Col N="360" /><i>inter alia</i>, its affairs are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors or for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.  In previous section 8 cases, petitions were preceded by preliminary examinations.</P>
    <P>The information becoming available yesterday from the RTE inquiries are a cause of serious concern to the Government.  We are currently taking legal advice as to the appointment of an inspector by the High Court under section 8 of the Companies Act and we hope to proceed with this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 29, 52 and 86 together.  I met with representatives of the Small Firms Association on 23 February 1998 to hear their views on a range of current issues of importance for the small business sector.  The association also presented me with the results of its fourth national employment survey which indicated that the small business sector has been experiencing a healthy growth period in the past 12 months, with high levels of confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific requests made by the association are as follows: business tax measures in the December 1998 budget should be particularly beneficial to small business; consideration should be given to the particular difficulties a minimum wage would impose on small firms; regarding recruitment difficulties, unemployed persons in receipt of State payments who refuse legitimate jobs or training opportunities should have their social welfare entitlements reviewed; regarding Partnership 2000, the enterprise link service should be extended to the stage where a one stop <Col N="363" /> shop would exist in major population centres, a central control unit to oversee the easing of the administration burden should be established under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach; regarding UK multiples, the Acquired Rights Directive should be extended to employees of companies who have a substantial business relationship with a company that has been taken over, State agencies should fully support retailers, distributors and suppliers.  Moral pressure should be exerted on the multiples; the new Company Development Agency should have a similar legal remit to county enterprise boards in regard to supporting firms in the services sector; and the association requested support for their planned Enterprise 2000 exhibition.</P>
    <P>I assured the Small Firms Association that the Government clearly recognises the vital role played by the small business sector in developing our economy and also recognises the difficulties faced by small business in surviving and growing. The Government is fully committed to continually improving the operating environment for small business.  Its Action Plan for the Millennium gives a clear commitment to keep &ldquo;the concerns and growth potential of the small business and services sectors at the top of the political agenda&rdquo;.  The Government has also given an undertaking in the programme to fulfil the commitments in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The meeting with the association afforded me a useful opportunity to hear the views and concerns of small business at first hand and I will bear these in mind in my effort to continually improve the business environment.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that I am committed to ongoing liaison with the small business sector.  In addition to meeting the Small Firms Association, I have also met the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association.  I am also being advised by the Small Business and Services Forum, which is comprised mainly of small business practitioners. The forum has a specific mandate to advise me on policy in relation to small business. In addressing the forum, I have made it clear that it has a very important role to play in prioritising the issues of importance for small business and that the views developed by the forum will receive my serious consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department and its agencies are in ongoing contact with all <Col N="364" /> the relevant bodies regarding the effects on competition of the changing structure in the marketplace. In regard to the Deputy's allegation of a high street invasion, our EU Single Market commitments require that companies from other member states are entitled to set up business in Ireland provided they comply with the requisite legislation.  Equally Irish companies can, and have, set up successfully abroad.  Included in Irish legislation are the rules of competition which apply in all sectors of the economy and which were strengthened through the introduction of public enforcement powers in 1996.  This is designed to benefit the consumer.</P>
      <P>The policy which I and my predecessor have followed in regard to the effects of these developments on Irish distributors, specifically in the case of Tesco and, more recently, Boots was elaborated by me in reply to Dáil Question No. 14 on 18 February 1998.  In addition, in response to concerns in this area, Forbairt is in the process of establishing a supplier development programme which it is intended to pilot in the near future. This programme will determine, at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist the Irish sub-supply base to respond to the challenges arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of new opportunities which are arising in the market. A broadly based steering group involving the development agencies, retailers and suppliers will guide the development and work of the programme which will cover the food and non-food sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey comparing the price of insurance premiums, among various categories of driver in the UK, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Ireland, was undertaken by Deloitte and Touche, in its report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland, published in 1996.  This survey was based on premium quotations, obtained from a number of insurance companies, in each of these countries, in respect of the years 1990, 1992, and 1994.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche survey found that adults' premium rates, in the UK were 48 per cent lower, France 21 per cent lower, Denmark 10 per cent lower, and the Netherlands 6 per cent lower. The widest gap was between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Premiums in the Netherlands and Denmark, were not significantly lower than Ireland and the survey found that differences in premium rates quoted, between Ireland and the other European countries narrowed over the period 1990 to 1994.  Trends in the Danish motor market indicated that premium rates there, would overtake or exceed Irish rates in the short term.</P>
      <P>The detailed results of the comparative survey, are published in the Deloitte and Touche report.</P>
      <P>With regard to claims comparisons with the UK market, the difference in premiums is broadly proportional to the difference in motor claims costs, in each State.  Although UK drivers lodge more claims as car theft is more common in Britain, the average Irish motor claims estimate was over four times the UK average and the claims bill per registered vehicle, as a proxy for motor policy numbers, was nearly three times the UK's figure.</P>
      <P>The differential in claims cost is attributable to a number of differences, between Britain and ourselves.  Britain has relatively more claims involving low cost damage to vehicles, because they have a higher proportion of comprehensive policies, which are offered with cheap no claims bonus protection, and because they have more urban driving, characterized by low speed &lsquo;fender bender&rsquo; collisions in traffic.  Ireland has a large rural road network and a lower traffic density, nine private cars per km of road as against 56 in the UK, which increases the proportion of highspeed accidents involving personal injury.</P>
      <P>The cost of claims caused by uninsured drivers is the same in both jurisdictions.  Garda Síochána statistics showed that at the time of publication of the Deloitte and Touche report, 6 per cent of Irish motorists were uninsured.  According to the latest Department of Environment and Local Government statistics, this figure has now fallen to 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the Deloitte and Touche report found that, for most categories of driver, there is a competitive market for motor insurance in Ireland.  Drivers belonging to groups, characterized <Col N="366" /> by maturity and good claims experience, have seen their premiums reduce, in real terms, since 1990.  Young drivers, as a group and individuals with poor safety records, will have limited choice of insurer and will face high premium costs in Ireland, as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In relation to reducing the cost of motor insurance, including the high motor insurance cost burden, borne by young drivers, I must refer to the basic fact that the cost of insurance is directly linked to the cost of claims, which, in turn, is linked to the number of motor accidents. To reduce the cost of premiums, we must therefore reduce the number of accidents.  In this regard, I am reconstituting the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  This board will advise me regarding the premiums being charged, the system of differentiating premiums in respect of different categories and classes of drivers-owners, the relationship between claims and premiums charged, in each category, and any other matters, which the board may consider appropriate.  In addition, my Department and I are closely monitoring initiatives such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government's examination of the Ontario graduated licensing system for young drivers, the preparation by the National Safety Council of Road Safety and driving instructional material, for inclusion in school curricula, and the insurance incentive scheme, wherein certain driving instructors with the Driving Instructors Register (DIR) offer a special 25 hour driving course to learner drivers, who are then entitled to an introductory discount, from an Irish Insurance Federation Member Company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr Gerard Ryan, the officer authorised by me in January under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, is continuing to examine the books and <Col N="367" /> documents of Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd., Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd.  and Hamilton Ross Company Ltd. A large amount of documentation has been made available to him in the last two months, and information relevant to his inquiries continues to be received by him.  At this stage, I am not in a position to indicate when his report might be completed.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990 outlines the restricted circumstances in which publication or disclosure of these reports may take place. Until I have received and studied Mr Ryan's reports and obtained legal advice on their content, I will not be in a position to indicate what action on my part will be appropriate.  I will also refrain from public comment until I am in a position to make a definitive statement in the matter.</P>
    <P>My Department estimates that the cost to its Vote of Mr Ryan's inquiries is of the order of £28,410 to date.  Of this sum, £25,835 involves the salary and overhead costs of Mr Ryan and other departmental staff involved in the investigation. The balance of £2,575 relates to the cost to the Department of sourcing outside expertise to assist Mr Ryan's work.</P>
    <P>The above figures do not take account of the cost of legal advice and legal proceedings in connection with Mr Ryan's investigations which are being borne on the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. This has included, for instance, the cost of defending the legal challenge which was initiated in January by Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited to my appointment of Mr Ryan and which was subsequently withdrawn.</P>

    <P>While the Commission proposals would involve a phasing-out of current objective I status over the coming period.  the Council negotiations on the proposals have yet to begin.  The regulations to be adopted by Council next year could well differ significantly from those proposed.  Likewise, the actual level of structural funding to be made available to Ireland in the post-1999 period has also to be negotiated.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 38, 50, 62 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>According to available data employment in the sector at end December 1995 stood at 14,100 and at end December 1996 at 13,000.</P>
      <P>These figures show a small increase over those quoted in my reply dated 9 December 1997 to a similar question by Deputy Durkan.  The difference in the figures is due to a recalculation by the Central Statistics Office of the employment estimates from 1991 onwards, which takes account of the benchmark employment results of the 1991, 1992 and 1993 Censuses for Industrial Production.  Provisional figures for June 1997 also show employment at 13,000.  Statistics on employment levels within the industry are not yet available for the full year 1997.</P>
      <P>While the numbers employed between December 1996 and June 1997 show no change, there was a decrease of 1,100 from end 1995 and I am aware that there were further losses during the latter half of 1997.  This is naturally very disappointing but as I already indicated in my December reply, the clothing sector in Ireland is in a transitional period, coming from a traditional low cost base through to a higher cost economy. This restructuring of the industry is vital in order to have a competitive future.  The changing nature of the business is widely recognised and accepted by the industry.</P>
      <P>My Department and the industrial development agencies, in co-operation with the industry, have made concerted efforts to assist the sector to restructure and a number of initiatives have been put in place in recent years.</P>
      <P>The most recent strategy agreed for the sector is entitled &ldquo;Securing the Future&rdquo;.  This has helped to put in place a co-ordinated series of initiatives undertaken jointly on the part of the industry and the development agencies directed to building strong clothing companies capable of competing on both domestic and international markets.</P>
      <P>The specific initiatives which are brought together under this action programme vary from company to company but typically they involve assistance towards one or more of the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash; changes in product-market strategy</P>
      <P>&mdash; financial restructuring</P>
      <P>&mdash; support for the purchase of new technology</P>
      <P>&mdash; retraining costs associated with production system change</P>
      <P>&mdash; strengthening design capability through the purchase of computer-aided design and the recruitment of designers</P>
      <P>&mdash; the promotion of best practice in clothingrelated technology through the Irish Garment Technology Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> A review of this strategy is currently being undertaken by my Department, Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála, FÁS and the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation.  This review is intended to give the industry a stronger focus to its competitive drive and update it on the various measures available to assist it in securing a long-term viable future.</P>

      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for the enforcement of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  Under the Act, consumers who buy computer software products from a retailer here have the same rights as when they purchase any other product i.e. products must be of merchantable quality, they must be fit for their particular purpose and they must be as described and, if they are not, the consumer is entitled to a repair, replacement or a refund of moneys paid. The consumers contract is with the retailer who sold the products and, therefore, it is the retailer who is responsible for putting things right even for defects which may be the fault of the manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Consumers' rights are adequately protected when they purchase direct from a retailer against whom they can seek to have their rights enforced, if necessary through the courts.  However, I am informed by the director that the situation is not as straightforward when, for example, consumers engage in global shopping for software via open networks such as the internet.  The director is involved with the OECD Consumer Policy Committee and the International Marketing Supervision network (IMSN &mdash; the Director is currently President of this Group) on work on improving consumer protection in these situations. OECD and IMSN projects include the development of mechanisms for refunds in distant transactions, the development of principles of conduct for distant sellers, the co-ordination of law enforcement activities to control cross-border fraud and the development of consumer protection guidelines for electronic commercial transactions conducted over the internet.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to have OECD guidelines electronic commerce adopted at the Montreal Ministerial Conference in October 1998.</P>

      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the New Millennium contains a commitment to examine the future role and structure of FÁS.  Arising from this examination and other developments within my Department, the Deputy will be aware of a recent Government decision to establish a new enterprise support agency to help Irish controlled companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage with a view to increasing sales, exports and employment.  It is intended that relevant elements of An Bord Tráchtála, Forbairt and FÁS will be incorporated into this new agency.</P>
      <P>The policy basis for this restructuring is set out in a briefing document entitled <i>New Support Structures for Enterprise Development &mdash; the Issues and Concepts Outlined</i>, copies of which have been placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Members.  In addition to the changes I have mentioned, I am also currently reviewing how best to strengthen the employment service component of FÁS, including its inter-relationship with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the one hand and the local employment service on the other. However, I have not yet taken any decisions that would involve structural or institutional change.</P>
      <P>FÁS training programmes are, in principle, open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking employment, regardless of gender. However, priority of access is given to those who are on the live register.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, FÁS has had in place an action programme for women which adopts specific measures in certain key areas of FÁS activity to ensure that every opportunity is afforded to women to participate fully in the labour market.</P>
      <P>This action programme has met with considerable success.  In 1997, 5,171 women completed specific skills training courses with FÁS.  This represented 44 per cent of the total number of people completing.  A further 1,158 women completed return to work training, which is designed specifically to upgrade skills as well as develop new skills, for women returning to the work force.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Partnership 2000 Agreement, a working group has been set up to examine a range of issues affecting women's access to the labour market.  This group is serviced by the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs and is expected to report to the Government later in the year.</P>

I further understand that in response to general concerns in this area, Forbairt is in the process of establishing a supplier development programme, which it is intended to pilot in the near future.</P>
      <P>This programme, will determine at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist the Irish sub-supply base to respond to the challenges arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of new opportunities which are arising in the market.</P>

      <P>The issue of discrimination against persons on the basis of age with regard to employment is being addressed in the Employment Equality Bill which my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly bring before the Dáil.  The Bill has already completed all stages in the Seanad.  The Bill will outlaw discrimination on the basis of age and on eight other grounds with regard to access to employment, conditions of employment, equal pay for work of equal value, training, work experience and promotion.  An infrastructure to support persons who feel they have been discriminated against in pursuing their rights will also be set up on foot of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I believe that a rights-based approach is a fairer and more effective way to attack any discrimination there may be against persons over 50 than an incentive-based approach.</P>
      <P>In addition to the general floor of rights which is being enacted, I am conscious that older persons who have been long-term unemployed can be at a particular disadvantage in finding a job. That is why we have set aside 11,000 places on the community employment jobs option and 2,000 places on the jobs initiative for very long-term unemployed persons over the age of 35.  It would certainly be my intention to maintain this kind of positive action in reintegrating persons in situations of greatest disadvantage to the labour market.</P>

      <P>The key to protecting the general health and safety of all workers does not lie in changing or amending what is fundamentally strong legislation &mdash; it lies in changing attitudes and particularly those of a certain minority of employers to health and safety management and in ensuring that they meet all their obligations, both legal and moral.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety and it sets out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities which employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. Under this legislation, it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Act is supplemented by a series of regulations, in particular the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 1995.  The former extend the requirements of the Act and lay down provisions for health and safety in specific aspects of working activity such as the workplace, the use by workers of work equipment and personal protective equipment, manual handling of loads and work with display screen equipment. The latter is one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one industry.</P>
      <P>However, the 1989 Act is kept under constant review both by my Department and by the authority as regards its applicability and effectiveness and should it be concluded from such reviews that regulation in this area would benefit from an amendment of or addition to existing legislation, I assure the Deputy that the necessary steps will be taken accordingly.</P>

      <P>As I understand it job rotation is a labour market reintegration programme practised in a systematic way mainly in Denmark.  Even there I understand it is being wound down somewhat on both cost grounds and because it was leading to skills shortages in certain areas.  This Government similarly attaches a very high priority to the re-integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market as can be clearly seen from the most recent budget where we increased the number of places on active labour market programmes by 7,000 and enhanced the existing range of in-work benefits.</P>
      <P>In the next few weeks, we expect to complete our national employment action plan drawn up under the EU employment guidelines in which we make a commitment to further measures to assist the reintegration into work of persons who have been long-term unemployed.  Notable among these commitments are greater access by long-term unemployed persons to mainstream training and a considerably enhanced and more proactive placement service.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that a form of job rotation exists in the public sector where career breaks and job sharing allow a greater participation in the labour force than might otherwise be the case.  The implementation of similar measures in the private sector is, I believe, a desirable goal, but one which must be pursued by agreement at company level.</P>
      <P>Of course there is no guarantee that such vacancies could be taken up by the long-term unemployed. I understand that interdepartmental discussions in the recent past on the feasibility of this kind of targeting did not come up with any conclusions as to how this might be achieved.</P>
      <P>I believe the budget measures and the employment action plan commitments I referred to offer the best mix of programmes and options for the Irish situation but obviously in refining our policies over the five year lifetime of the guidelines we will have regard to successful interventions in other member states.</P>

      <P>Teleworkers are people who work from home or a local centre and use telecommunications equipment for a substantial part of their job.  They may be self-employed, part-time or full-time employees and work for one employer or several clients.</P>
      <P>The number of teleworkers in Ireland is difficult to estimate.  Using the narrow definition of a teleworker as one who uses a computer at home to provide a service for a client or for an employer, then the numbers are small.  Taking the wider definition of teleworking as work carried out using telematic links with computer and telephones in a centre or more traditional type of workplace, the number could be over 6,000. These include those involved in telemarketing or telesales, mainly computer sales, operating freephone lines, banking service, data processing and central reservation points.</P>
      <P>In general, employment protection legislation applies to &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, that is persons who are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, including persons employed on fixed term contracts and persons employed on contracts for a specified purpose.  Thus, teleworkers who fall into the category of &ldquo;employees&rdquo; are covered by labour protection legislation.  Thus, teleworkers who are not &ldquo;employees&rdquo; and who are in effect, self-employed, are not covered by such legislation.</P>
      <P>I should point out that labour laws regulate employer/employee relationships only and do not attempt to regulate self-employment.  The question of whether or not an individual's employment relationship comes within the scope of a specific labour law is a matter for the relevant adjudicative body under the relevant Act, for example, a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the case of payment of wages and unfair dismissals.</P>
      <P>All teleworkers, whether self-employed or otherwise, are fully protected by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and its associated regulations.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, Act 1989 provides a comprehensive legislative framework by means of which effective health and safety procedures can be formed and managed in all sectors of the economy, including the telesales and teleservices sector. Under this legislation, it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.</P>
      <P>In the context of the application to employees of the legislation referred to in the preceding paragraphs I am not aware of any specific problems with the operation of such legislation in the telesales or teleservices sector.</P>

      <P>The educational and skills levels of the Irish workforce represent the single most important factor in the development of the enterprise sector, and in achieving our ambitious national objectives to increase employment and living standards and to reduce unemployment.  Since the Government came into office in July 1997, it has made a number of direct and tangible responses in the area of skill shortages in order to meet the needs of our rapidly developing economy.  Among these are the following. An extra £5 million has been provided to commence the expansion of student intake in computing and technician courses, with a view to achieving an increased annual output of 1,000 computer graduates and 750 technicians.  In November 1997, the Government announced the establishment of a £250 million education technology investment fund as part of a major drive aimed at raising the skills profile of our students and workers.  Also in November, I announced the establishment, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, of a new business, education and training partnership.  The partnership will develop strategies, at the highest levels, to tackle the issues of skills needs, manpower forecasting and education for industry and business.  The December budget increased the threshold for the payment of PRSI from £80 to £100, to make it more attractive for people to take up lower paid jobs.  It also introduced a tax initiative for the long-term unemployed, which benefits both the employee and the employer.  FÁS has also been allocated additional funds in the current year to expand its provision in the software and electronic areas.  This it is now doing and trainee numbers will increase by about 250 this year.  FÁS is responsible for apprenticeship in Ireland and has introduced a new standardsbased system over the last few years.  The number of apprentices has risen rapidly to meet the demands of the economy, particularly in the construction sector.  In 1997, a record 5,300 apprentices were registered, compared with 4,200 in 1996 and levels of around 3,000 in preceding years.  In conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation, FÁS has undertaken an extensive promotional campaign to encourage Irish-born craftspersons currently working in the United Kingdom to consider returning to work in Ireland.  This campaign has been very successful, with an estimated 5,000 returning home in 1997 and a further 3,000 projected to return in 1998.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures recently agreed by the Government, together with the ongoing programmes being undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education and Science, will ensure that skill shortages are minimised and are addressed promptly where they occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>An International Financial Services Centre working group, under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and made up of representatives of our Department and the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank, the IDA and some private sector interests, who are members of the IFSC banking and treasury committee, was set up by us last year with a view to finding solutions to problems created by certain Irish registered non-resident companies, or IRNRs.  There were no written terms of reference set out for the group.  The work of this group is ongoing and they have so far considered proposals in relation to taxation, company law and the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>In December last I set up an interagency/departmental working group in our own Department, made up of representatives from the IDA, Forbairt, Forfás, the company law section and the planning and company registration office, with a view to advising me on the proposals under consideration in the IFSC group.  This group has made its recommendations to me and these will be subject to the usual procedures in relation to Government decision making.</P>
      <P>The recommendations are as follows.  In relation to taxation measures it recommended that we provide that once a company registers in Ireland it will be regarded as tax resident in Ireland, subject to the grant of exemptions, to certain companies, such as multinational companies, with operations here.  The Minister for Finance is considering this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to company law measures, the group recommended that the upcoming Companies (Amendment) Bill should provide that all companies <Col N="379" /> have a director resident in Ireland or the EU and that the number of directorships to be held by any person should be limited with the possibility of exemptions to be granted by either the Minister or the Registrar of Companies. These measures are the subject of discussion with the Office of the Attorney General, having regard in particular to constitutional and EU legal obligations. It was also recommended that the CRO take steps to ensure better enforcement/ compliance, with existing company law requirements applying to the CRO now that additional resources have been provided over the past two years for that office.</P>
    <P>In regard to money laundering provisions, the group also agreed to support a Central Bank proposal in the IFSC working group, which involves bringing company formation agents within the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The effect of this proposal would be to impose &ldquo;know your client&rdquo; requirements on company formation agents.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from previous discussions in this House over the past month of the complexity of the problem, of the desire not to hinder companies, using IRNRs for legitimate purposes and the unreliability of the estimated number of these companies.  Despite these difficulties, I want to reiterate our Government's commitment to finding a solution to the IRNR problem as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to my reply to Deputy Quinn on 18 February 1998 (Official Report Vol. 487 No. 4, Cols.  795 &mdash; 796).  As indicated at that time, I am reviewing the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, in conjunction with the social partners, with a view to appropriate measures being taken to address any gaps which may exist in the notification and consultation process for proposed collective redundancies.  This review is not likely to affect the status of the competitiveness and employment protection unit of my Department which provides advice and guidance to companies as well as ensuring, as far as possible, that firms in difficulty are identified in time to enable corrective action to be taken.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, a review of the early warning system for companies in difficulty is expected to be completed by mid-1998.</P>

      <Quest>the recommendations, if any, made by her or officials in her Department or the discussions, if any, entered into with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to rid the disincentive of participating in community employment schemes, particularly for those who stay on the scheme for the full three year period, in view of the fact that when or if they return to the live register they are then penalised by a reduction in payments and benefits ; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that eligibility for a social welfare payment and the rules applying to that payment are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring here to the introduction by the previous Government in the Social Welfare Act, 1996 of class A PRSI rates for community employment participants.  This puts community employment participants on a par with insured workers and its introduction was, I understand, strongly supported by the INOU and scheme workers themselves.</P>
      <P>One consequence of this change is that community employment participants now have an entitlement to an insurance-based unemployment payment if, on completion of their time on a scheme, they return to the live register rather than taking up a job or a training place.  They qualify for unemployment benefit rather than unemployment assistance as had been the case hitherto.  Unemployment benefit is not meanstested but as a short-term payment it does not carry entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits of free fuel, butter vouchers and Christmas bonus.</P>
      <P>I would indeed be concerned if this policy change by the previous Government was acting as a disincentive to participation in community employment but FÁS informs me that demand for community employment on the part of those eligible to participate remains strong.</P>

      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities.

I am satisfied that this message is fully understood and that the industrial development agencies involved are doing all that they can to realise a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.  This is evidenced by the fact that some 12,500 of the more than 15,000 or so jobs announced by this Government since taking up office have been located outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is the largest labour market reintegration programme in Ireland with an average of 41,000 places made available this year.  A total of 11,000 of these places are specifically reserved for those over 35 years and more than three years unemployed, with the remaining 30,000 places, available for those over 21 years of age and at least one year unemployed.</P>
      <P>The programme has been in existence since 1994, and in 1996 was set up in its present configuration to focus in a more targeted way on the long-term unemployed and other persons at most remove from the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years on, a full review of the programme <Col N="383" /> is now timely.

That review should be completed by June of this year and its conclusions should inform any further policy development on community employment.</P>
    <P>The Jobs initiative is a pilot programme targeted at those over 35 years and more than five years unemployed.  Given that the programme has only been in existence since October 1996 and that it is a pilot programme, any change in the criteria under which it operates can be considered after an evaluation of the pilot phase.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the market for the provision of mobile telephony services is open to competition under the auspices of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, by means of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Accordingly, price levels in this area are not controlled by regulation &mdash; they are a consequence of market forces.  Competition in markets overall is governed by the rules of competition as set out in the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, supplements the 1991 Act and provides for offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act.  In addition it now provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition.  The Director of Competition Enforcement was appointed in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
      <P>With the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the Competition Authority now has the right to initiate investigations on its own initiative into any alleged anti-competitive structure or practice that appears to it to warrant such an investigation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Director of Competition Enforcement can investigate, whether on his own initiative or as a result of a complaint, any breaches of the Competition Acts that he suspects has occurred or may occur.  As a result of these investigations he may make recommendations to the Competition Authority regarding the institution of legal proceedings in the matter.</P>

Reviews are undertaken with the assistance of various interested parties which include education providers, employers, trade unions and representatives of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The success of FÁS training programmes is reflected both in good employment placement rates and feedback from course participants.  The latest independent follow-up survey of a sample of FÁS trainees showed that four in five trainees had obtained a job since finishing their training. At the time of the survey, about 18 months after completing training, 65 per cent were employed, 10 per cent in further FÁS programmes or education and 17 per cent unemployed.  The remainder were unavailable for work for a variety of reasons.  Trainees who were interviewed in the course of the survey acknowledged the benefits of their training in terms of improved confidence, the identification of job opportunities, improved interview skills, new job skills and help in obtaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main area where I have some concern relates to the relatively low proportion of long-term unemployed people &mdash; abour 11 per cent currently &mdash; who participate on training programmes. This is partly due to an inadequacy of foundation or progression type programmes such as would enable long-term unemployed people, frequently coming from a low education or skills base, to access higher skills programmes.  I have <Col N="386" /> asked the new board of FÁS to address this problem and I expect FÁS will be coming forward with proposals later this year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a considerable period of time has elapsed since the publication of the Government response to the report of the industrial policy review group, the Culliton report, in 1993.  In the intervening period, there has been considerable progress across the key areas covered by the review group in, for example, infrastructure, competition policy, education and training, taxation, and the structure and operations of the industrial development agencies.  This has been reflected in the outstanding performance of business in growing sales and employment.</P>
      <P>The focus on competitiveness issues created by the Culliton report has been strengthened by the establishment of the National Competitiveness Council, operating under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department, whose first annual report was recently published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns voiced by certain retail interests about the implications of Sunday trading.  The social partners have, as the Deputy will appreciate, differing concerns about this issue and have differing perspectives as to how they should be addressed.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, has been keeping in close touch with ongoing developments in regard to the matter of Sunday trading in the retail sector.  It is his conviction &mdash; a conviction that I fully share &mdash; that a partnership approach rather than imposed legislative action is the key to a mutually acceptable resolution of the difficulties associated with Sunday working in the retail trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with this approach, Deputy Kitt recently launched a discussion process between the social partners aimed at reaching a voluntarily agreed <Col N="387" /> approach to the issue of Sunday working in the retail trade.  Following a meeting with the Minister of State on 30 January last, representatives of IBEC and ICTU have been meeting on the issue under an agreed independent Chairman. The Minister of State has requested that the chairman should submit to him a report on the outcome of these discussions by the end of April 1998.</P>
    <P>As regards the retail trading hours in EU member states for Saturday and Sunday, the Deputy should note that there are no rules / regulations / directives in operation or in contemplation at EU level with regard to such hours.  Arrangements of this nature are a matter for the individual EU member state Administrations to determine for themselves.  While practice varies from member state to member state, the trend generally is towards deregulation of trading hours.  My Department is not in possession of the details of the trading hours regimes of the individual EU member states and, in the short time available, has not been in a position to obtain them.</P>

      <P>All gas installations in domestic premises are governed by Irish Standard 813:1996 &mdash; Domestic Gas Installations.  The standard was prepared by the gas technical standards committee, which operates under the auspices of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.

    </Speaker>
    <P>BGE has assured me that it operates to the current Irish standards when providing a natural gas supply to new housing estates.  BGE procedures require that the certificate of conformance is obtained from the developer for each house before the gas meter is fitted.  At the time of fitting of the meter, the details of the certificate of conformance are checked for compliance with the standard.  In addition, a visible check of the installation <Col N="389" /> and flue is undertaken and the installation pipes are tested for gas tightness and confirmed to be satisfactory before the gas supply to the premises is turned on.  The standard, procedures and inspections are in accordance with international best practice and are designed to ensure that a safe and secure system is provided to each house.</P>
    <P>The Irish Liquified Petroleum Gas Association assures me that its members comply with the requirements of Irish Standard 813: 1996 and that all bulk and central storage supplied installations are checked for compliance with the requirements of the standard before gas is admitted.

      <P>The persons under reference are not civil servants of either an established or non-established category. They are civilian employees of the Department of Defence who are employed under the terms of section 30 (1) (g) of the Defence Act, 1954 to work with the Defence Forces.  Their appointments to their present positions as civilian employees of the Department of Defence were made directly by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Act, 1954.  The Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, do not apply to such appointments.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the Labour Court examined a claim made on behalf of certain civilian employees of the Department of Defence, serving in clerical positions with the Defence Forces, for establishment within the Civil Service.  The Labour Court found against concession of that claim.</P>
      <P>All civilian employees of the Department of Defence are categorised as non-established State employees.  They have a non-contributory pension scheme in place which provides a pension and a retirement lump sum on retirement, subject to certain service criteria.</P>

      <P>A minor backlog arose recently due to the absence of an officer on sick leave due to a motor accident.  This backlog is now being cleared by the provision of overtime.</P>
      <P>Two serological assistants will be on maternity leave from early to mid-June.  The Department will make arrangements to either transfer work to the Central Brucellosis Laboratory in Cork or to engage temporary staff to deal with the duties of these officers during their absence.</P>

      <P>; Officials of my Department met representatives of the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in early March to discuss the future financing of the society.  It was agreed that the society would revert to the Department by mid-year with its own analysis of its financial outlook to the year 2000.  I expect that further discussions will be held once such analysis is to hand.</P>
      <P>As regards lottery funding, I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Finance on 6 November 1997 to a parliamentary question regarding entitlements to and arrangements for such funding (Official Report, vol.  482, col.  996).</P>
      <P>My Department has, of course.  assisted the DSPCA to the extent of £200,000 since 1995. Indeed the largest single grant to date by my Department to DSPCA was made as recently as December last and amounted to £100.000.</P>

      <P>The person concerned declared a forage area of 21.00 hectares on his 1997 area aid application. When the maps, which were submitted with the application form, were digitised and validated against aerial photography, the digitised area amounted to 17.23 hectares.  I have arranged for maps of the digitised area to be issued to the person concerned so that the discrepancies can be resolved.  When the maps have been returned, duly amended, the case will be finalised and any outstanding payments will issue.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to comply with relevant EU legislation in relation to the advertising of contracts and the Government contracts committee is consulted as appropriate in relation to national contracting procedures.  The following companies were engaged in connection with the beef tribunal in the special circumstances outlined in each case:</P>
      <P>Doyle Court Reporters</P>
      <P>This company was engaged to provide stenographic services.  Due to the unique circumstances surrounding the setting up of the tribunal and the uncertainty of its duration, competitive tenders were not sought.  The State legal team indicated that only firms which could supply overnight transcripts would be suitable and recommended Doyle Court Reporters.</P>
      <P>John Hogan and Associates</P>
      <P>This company was recommended to my Department through the Department of the Taoiseach at the specific request of the State legal team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Carr Communications</P>
    <P>This company was also engaged at the specific request of the State legal team.</P>
    <P>Having regard to fundamental national public and animal health requirements/safeguards, from time to time immediate actions may be dictated, including precautionary advice to herdowners and others.  Accordingly, it has been expedient on occasion to draw down some supply additional to tendered amounts and to arrange immediate mail shots.</P>
    <P>The awarding and advertising of public contracts by State bodies is a matter for the bodies concerned.</P>

Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, VAT is chargeable on the total consideration received by <Col N="397" /> the supplier from the customer.

      <Quest>if he will give an estimate of the amount collected annually from retired PAYE workers under the youth employment training levy; if his attention has been drawn to the objections and resentment caused by this measure; if he will give details of its history and justification; and if he will make a statement on the matter and on the demands to have it abolished.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they estimate that the amount that will be collected in the forthcoming tax year, 1998-9, from all people aged 65 or over in relation to the employment and training levy will be around £10.7 million.  There is no estimate available in respect of pensioners on their own.</P>
      <P>The employment and training levy was introduced in the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, and is charged at a rate of 1 per cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, for example, social welfare payments including social welfare pensions. However, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum.  This has been increased each year since and now stands at £207 per week &mdash; £10,750 per annum &mdash; following the budget.</P>
      <P>The current arrangements in respect of the employment and training levy are more favourable to pensioners than most taxpayers because the levy is not applicable to their social welfare pension.  Therefore, the levy will only apply where income from other sources is in excess of £10,750 per annum.  The existing arrangement ensures that most pensioners on low and middle incomes are exempt from the levy.  Consequently, I do not intend to fully exempt occupational pensions from the levy, but I can confirm that the threshold for the levies will continue to be reviewed.</P>

I understand that the board has six beds in the Central Mental Hospital dedicated to female prison transfers.  Until the last six to 12 months, these beds satisfied needs arising most of the time.  However, there have been occasions, particularly during this period, when the Central Mental Hospital has not had the capacity to meet the needs of Mountjoy Prison.

      <P>The issue of planning permission is a matter for the relevant local authority. The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (SI No. 94 of 1997), which transpose the EU habitats directive into Irish law, provide that when considering an application for planning permission in an SAC, a local authority shall ensure that an appropriate assessment of the implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives is undertaken.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the result of such an assessment, the local authority may decide to grant permission for the proposed development or to refuse permission.</P>
      <P>Where there is a negative assessment and in the absence of alternative solutions, a local authority may still decide to grant planning permission for a proposed development where such development has to be carried out for reasons of overriding public interest.</P>
      <P>If the SAC site in question hosts a priority natural habitat type or a priority species, the only considerations of overriding public interest shall be: those relating to human health or public safety; beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment; or further to an opinion from the European Commission, other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware clause 2 (iii) of the PCW provided that claims for improvements in pay and conditions be addressed on a basis which would involve change in structures, work practices or other conditions of service. Negotiations took place with the Prison Officers' Association under this clause and agreement on a package of measures was reached.  One of the issues which was agreed with the association was that rent allowance will be pensionable to members of the Prison Service serving on or after 1 January 1994.  It was, also, agreed with the <Col N="407" /> association that rent allowance will be reckonable for the purpose of calculating lump sums or death gratuity in the case of members who retired or died in service in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993.  In such cases pension will only be adjusted to take account of rent allowance with effect from 1 January, 1994.</P>
      <P>Making rent allowance pensionable has cost implications.  Clause 2 (iii) of the PCW put a ceiling on the overall cost of agreements.  A cut off date for the pensionability of rent allowance had, therefore, to be agreed upon.  The dates outlined above were agreed with the association.</P>
      <P>It is established practice that allowances, where they are made pensionable for the first time, are made pensionable only for employees serving on or after the effective date.  This has been consistent policy for all public service groups.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a European Social Fund-aided staff development scheme, known as the training of trainers programme, a <Col N="410" /> number of years ago, whereby funds are made available to provide training courses to enable staff in the third level institutions to update their skills and knowledge and to upgrade their qualifications. As a result of this initiative a range of courses were devised and developed by these institutions and are designed to meet the unique needs of each participating institution and to enable institutions to customise their staff development requirements.</P>
      <P>There is a significant emphasis within the programme in the university sector on the development of pedagogical skills training.  Furthermore, the Irish Universities' Training Network was set up in 1992 with the aim of encouraging and promoting collaborative development and training initiatives, to complement the initiatives being taken by individual universities.  The Higher Education Authority is also considering the introduction of a Graduate Diploma-Masters Degree in Higher Education Studies for both academic and administrative staff, which would be offered by distance education via the HEANET.</P>

The findings of the recent ESRI school leavers survey indicate that a person's socio-economic status continues to exert a strong influence on educational participation at third level.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the factors underlying this phenomenon go beyond our education system.  Nevertheless, my Department has a range of measures in place to further the promotion of equality of access to higher education. The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and the transition from second to third level is well established.  In this regard fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>The measures in place include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the breaking the cycle initiative; the home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils; a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people between the ages of eight and 15 at risk of early school leaving; the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
      <P>In 1997 my Department provided £77,000 in direct financing for three access initiatives involving Dublin City University, University of Limerick and Trinity College to improve participation of pupils from disadvantaged areas at third level. The initiatives involve links between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.  The experiences of these initiatives were considered in some detail at the recent USI conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to measures specifically targeted at third level, the Higher Education Authority has provided £260,000 in 1996 and £475,000 in 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities.  The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special <Col N="412" /> entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the college is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city and there are a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  A policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.</P>
    <P>I introduced the new national certificate in technology course, which was developed by a joint education-industry task force and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, and which commenced in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology.  This initiative is in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to give priority to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants to participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>The Regional Technical College equality network project which arose out of the EU programme, New Opportunities for Women, is operational in six institutes of technology. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus at women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.  It is envisaged that there will be an expansion of the programmes under this project to include those colleges not already participating in the scheme. Dublin Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology offer specific courses for second chance education for mature and disadvantaged women.</P>
    <P>There is a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA Level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology, which is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>
    <P>In January 1998 I announced that the Government had given approval for the creation of a new third level institution in Blanchardstown to serve the west of Dublin.  Membership of the board, which will be announced shortly, will be charged with completing strategic planning for the institution and making arrangements for the commencement of courses.  The new institution, to be called the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, will meet two very important needs, namely, to increase participation in third level education in west Dublin, an area with one of the lowest participation rates in the country; and to help meet the skills requirements of expanding industries.</P>

      <Quest>whether contracts or extension of contracts, which might fall within the criteria for public advertisement and tender as required by EU or national legislation, were awarded by his Department or bodies or agencies under the aegis of his Department without advertisement for public tender in the past seven years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It has been a long-standing practice for my Department, and agencies under its aegis, to adhere to EU and Government Contracts Committee procedures regarding public advertisement and tender.  The number of contracts awarded over the last seven years would run to thousands and I cannot justify assigning scarce staff resources to examining all these cases.  However, tender procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and EU auditors. If the Deputy has a concern about any contract awarded by my Department, or an agency under its aegis, I will have the case examined.</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the situation in relation to the retention of a teacher at a school (details supplied) in Dublin 11; the reason this school does not have disadvantaged status in view of the fact three other primary and secondary schools in the same parish have disadvantaged status; when an application for this was last made; the reason for the apparent inconsistency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>No decisions have yet been made regarding staffing allocations to primary schools for the 1998-99 school year.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 schools were included for capitation purposes only.  Three schools from the Ballygall area were granted disadvantaged area status at that time.  However, I understand the school to which the Deputy refers did not apply for inclusion in the scheme on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.  The needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I announced on 18 July that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third-level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
      <P>Teastas, the Irish national certification authority, was established as an interim authority on 18 September 1995 and has worked closely and in consultation with the partners in the education and training sectors since that time.  Teastas reported on an interim basis in January 1997 and has recently issued its second report.  I also held a forum on the development of a national qualifications framework on 13 February 1998 at which the technological sector of higher education was represented and played an active role.</P>
      <P>I aim to publish legislation in the coming months which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.  It is the intention that the development of this legislation for the technological sector will form part of the broad single legislation for the development of a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the State has discharged its obligations on foot of the judgment in question. Apart from obligations relating to costs, which have already been discharged, the obligations arising for the State related to the provision <Col N="415" /> of an adequate education service for the child in question.  In this connection, the court envisaged the provision of an education service by a fully qualified primary teacher and at a <Col N="416" /> maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the necessary educational provision is being made available to the child in question and is available to other children with similar disabilities.</P>
