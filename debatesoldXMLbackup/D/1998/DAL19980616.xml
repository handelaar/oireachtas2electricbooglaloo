      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has approved the establishment of a Government millennium steering group.  I have been asked to chair the steering group and the membership will be announced in the near future.  The steering group will examine and make recommendations on significant national projects which have been proposed as millennium projects and possible means of funding such projects.  It will examine and recommend a system for supporting community, local, county or regional commemorative projects which will provide an opportunity for local communities, including in areas of social disadvantage, to participate in the millennium commemoration.</P>

      <P>Is the steering committee the same body to which the Taoiseach referred on 10 March when he talked about a ministerial task force?  Will it be a ministerial committee or will it include representatives from non-governmental bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same group to which the Taoiseach referred.  The committee will be made up of representatives from various Departments which will have particular roles in the commemorations. It is envisaged that outside interests, such as business, arts, trade unions and so on, will be represented on the committee.  In representing the Taoiseach's Department, I will be the only ministerial representative on the committee.</P>

      <P>Has the Government decided on its budget for the millennium?  In disbursing moneys to local organisations, will the committee operate through the existing channels available to the Departments or will it establish a stand alone method for allocating money, which would be better than chasing groups from one Department to another?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that the millennium is the 2000th anniversary of Christianity.  As Chair of the committee, does the Minister consider that in marking such an event it is important to bear in mind the appalling atrocities for which certain sections of Christianity were responsible during that 2000 year period?  We must also bear in mind the need to encourage open mindedness, tolerance and pluralism, particularly on this island, during the next millennium and the fact that there are people other than Christians living here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A budget for the commemorations has not yet been decided.  I can only refer the Deputy to what the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech about some funding being available for suitable projects.  The committee will have to hold further discussions with him on that matter.  The task of the steering committee will be to co-ordinate activities, not to dominate them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has already announced the setting up of a millennium committee which seeks to deal with festivals and celebrations.  Dublin Corporation has set up a company, Míle Átha Cliath, and has appointed a chief executive and a board. It has a list of projects which it wants to carry out. Various churches, organisations and local authorities are organising activities for the millennium. Our role as a steering committee will be to try to pull all that together and to put recommendations to Government about a small number of substantial projects which would properly and appropriately commemorate this important occasion.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the Deputy's remark about Christianity.  It is important that we are inclusive. For example, we have tried to make the 1798 celebrations inclusive rather than cause further division or bitterness.  I am opposed to any type of celebration of the millennium which would deepen divisions between churches or people.</P>
      <P>As soon as the House goes into recess, I will reflect on the discussions in the House and consult widely on how best to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider having representatives from the Opposition parties on this steering group to celebrate the new millennium rather than confining it to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to have consensus.  It is proposed that this committee will be appointed by the Government.  I will discuss with the Taoiseach what structure might <Col N="651" /> be used to consult the Opposition on the matter. I want to consult the House fully so that our commemoration is something of which the country can be proud.  I am not interested in grandiose projects or schemes but in commemorating the passage of time, as marked by the year 2000, in an appropriate, practical and dignified way and in making it a commemoration of all the people so that everyone feels they own this project.</P>
      <P>We must also lower expectations.  I do not want the word to go out from this House that every group can apply for funding for a pet project.  We should be focused and structured and select and support projects which will stand the test of time so that future generations will know we expressed our national pride of place, the importance of our cultural traditions and the aspirations of our communities in a dignified way.  I will consult widely on the matter and I will discuss it with the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's confirmation that there will no element of triumphalism in the projects supported by the Government.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could indicate if the Department of Education and Science is considering any projects for the millennium, particularly in relation to literacy.  Would the Minister for Education and Science consider setting a date, such as 2005, by which to eliminate adult illiteracy? Perhaps the Minister could also indicate if the Department of Education and Science is considering the inclusion of a study of tolerance in the school curriculum, both at primary and secondary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of nor do I see any proposal on my files from the Department of Education and Science on the matters of either literacy or tolerance.  I am anxious that the tone of the celebrations should help people in disadvantaged areas and assist in the areas of literacy and tolerance.  At the same time I do not want a simple millennium celebration to become an excuse for funding a whole range of projects, which the Government should and does fund on a day to day basis, such as literacy and tolerance programmes.  We will not throw money around like confetti because there happens to be a millennium and use it as an excuse for a whole range of projects.  The Deputy is correct in suggesting that if we can structure various projects and if the committee receives proposals from the Department of Education that can be ringfenced in some sensible way, then we will look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree he cannot throw any money around, not to mention throwing it around like confetti, if the Minister for Finance has not yet given him any?  Will the Minister indicate whether there is any likelihood of the Minister for Finance allocating any money to this committee before we reach the millennium given <Col N="652" /> that it is only 18 months away?  Does he know the date by which funds might be allocated to the committee?  Will the Minister explain how his committee can make plans when it is unaware of what budget, if any, will be available to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how one approaches these matters.  Do we grab money from the Department of Finance and then sit down and ask how we will spend it because it has been given to us by the Minister?  That is one way of managing finances.  The other way is for the committee to recommend certain projects because they will express our national pride and will mark the 2000 years tidemark and reflect on mankind in a proper way.  If we approach it from that angle we can ask the Minister for Finance for the funds we need.  I will be more comfortable when the committee decides what needs to be done and then secures the necessary funding. That is what we are at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a budget.  I received this assignment the week before last.  We now have to form the steering group and call a meeting.  Already there are a couple of dozen projects on the files from Dublin Corporation, Dublin Tourism and many groups throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we commemorating 2000 years of Christianity or are we seeking to learn from the 2000 years and create a more open society for the future?  The mission statement of the committee is important in that regard.  Will the Minister indicate if there is a statement of intent for the steering group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not.  We have just started the process.  The files have been building up as people have been forwarding ideas, suggestions and submissions and so on.  We have only commenced to tackle it since my appointment. The committee will be appointed shortly.  So far we have not compiled a mission statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am glad to hear what the Deputy has to say, because we need a mission statement. We need to make sure that the celebrations are part of the solutions to our problems rather than create any new problems.  There can and will always be different interpretations of a celebration like this.  Different churches will see it <Col N="653" /> in different ways.  Different groups will see it as marking a different passage in their time.</P>
    <P>It is also the end of a century in which there have been wars and bloodshed and at the same time the great excitement of inventions and medical breakthroughs.  People will see it as another major birthday and will want to reflect on it in that way.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Government takes an inclusive role which allows the churches, professions, local authorities and groups to do what they do best within an overall theme of inclusiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>With this objective of commemorating the millennium in mind, has the Government plans to develop a multi-purpose national sports arena which could also be used as a national event centre for music concerts, in light of the planning problems associated with many venues and the need for a large suitable venue to avoid problems associated with the lack of capacity of venues such as the Point Theatre?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's response on literacy and initiatives from the Department of Education and Science, he might convey to that Department that it might begin by withdrawing the directive it sent out in recent weeks to some of the most disadvantaged inner city schools informing them that they must lose teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In drawing up a strategy, has the Minister decided whether we are celebrating a new beginning, that is a new millennium, or commemorating 2,000 years of the past?  There is quite a difference.  If we will celebrate a new beginning, which I hope we will, we will deal with the sort of problems outlined by Deputy Gregory and Deputy De Rossa as distinct from thinking always of the past.  Given that we hope for peace on this island for the first time in hundreds of years, surely this is an opportunity to celebrate a new beginning for Ireland and think about all the positive things about for the future as distinct from always thinking of the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thinks of the good and bad times of the past and celebrates the start of a new year.  I suppose in that sense it will be a commemoration like any other, but I hope it will focus on the future while at the same time taking careful note of the past.</P>
      <P>One thing I must do rather urgently is compile a list of what is happening around the world.  We want to know what other Governments are doing to see if there are ideas which would be useful to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The next meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs is scheduled for 1 July 1998. The committee has met on five occasions to date: 9 October 1997, 13 January 1998, 18 February 1998, 23 April 1998 and 10 June 1998.  As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Cabinet committee is to give political direction and leadership and to demonstrate the collective commitment of the Government to dealing with problems of social inclusion.  The committee assesses progress on the strategies being employed to deal with poverty and disadvantage, namely the national anti-poverty strategy, the national drugs strategy and the local urban and rural development operational programme, and resolves any policy or <Col N="657" /> organisational problems which might inhibit an effective response.</P>
      <P>At its last meeting on 10 June the Cabinet committee agreed detailed criteria for the operation of the £30 million young people's facilities and services fund, including a definition of the target group. These criteria will be used by the local development groups in drawing their plans for spending £20 million in the 13 task force areas.  They also include the criteria by which the plans and their component projects will be assessed by the assessment committee chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee also agreed to make available a minimum level of £1 million to each task force area over the three years of the fund, subject to the submission of plans which meet the overall objective of the fund and the eligibility and evaluation criteria.  The additional £7 million will be allocated to projects which meet identified gaps and needs in the area or across a number of task force areas and meet the objectives and criteria set out for the fund.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee has set a three month deadline of the end of September for submission of the plans to the assessment committee.  In this timeframe, each development group will profile its area, consult as widely as possible, invite and consider proposals from community/voluntary and statutory organisations with a view to drawing up an integrated plan which is clearly focused on the needs of the target group.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Cabinet committee agreed that a technical assistance provision of £150,000 from the overall £20 million would be made available to the development groups to acquire the resources to enable them to prepare the plans. A maximum of £11,500 will be provided to each development group for this purpose and allocations will be made on the basis of satisfactory submissions to the assessment committee from the development groups.</P>

      <P>While there is a sense of much activity at community level in many of the areas in Dublin worst affected by the drugs problem, the issue of combating drugs has slipped from the Government's agenda.  People are working very hard to try to stand still.  The problem is not abating. Many have concluded there are serious gaps in tackling educational disadvantage.  Does the Minister of State agree with the view shared by many working at local level that the Department of Education and Science needs to get seriously involved in tackling the area of educational disadvantage if we are to make any progress in tackling the drugs problem?  Does the Cabinet committee intend to deal with this area in the near future or possibly at its July meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's suggestion that the combating of drugs has slipped from the Government's agenda.  I am the Minister of State responsible for the national drugs strategy. It occupies a considerable amount of my time and <Col N="658" /> I am very encouraged by the excellent work undertaken by the 13 local drugs task forces. Nobody expected them to deliver immediately on every issue and policy implementation, be it a project or a service.  However, significant progress is being made in these areas which should also be taken in conjunction with the young people's facilities and services fund.  The implementation of projects and services associated with that fund will make a further considerable impact on combating the misuse of drugs.  We are involving the VEC as one of the three elements of the development group because of its considerable expertise in this area.  The other elements are the local authority and the local drugs task force, which is expected to provide the chairperson for the development group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not addressed my question on the tackling of educational disadvantage.  Does he accept that in a number of areas, most notably education, voluntary efforts cannot fill the gap, that unless the Department of Education and Science takes its responsibilities seriously in terms of tackling educational disadvantage in a structured way, efforts to tackle the problem at community level will not succeed and that the arm of the State needs to play its part also?  What proposal has the Government, if any, to ensure that the Department of Education and Science becomes fully involved in this campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is one of the primary Departments delivering services to the areas we are discussing in terms of the misuse of drugs and it has an important role in that area.  My colleague has brought forward a number of initiatives.  We are involving the VEC, a strong arm of the Department of Education and Science, in our fight in the 13 local drug task force areas.  Other Departments also have a significant role to play and are being targeted in terms of work they do through the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.  Each of the primary service delivery Departments has a significant role to play, no less than the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State indicated that the committee of which, I understand, he is chairperson is responsible for the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.  Has his committee carried out an audit of the 1997-8 budget in terms of its impact on the categories outlined in the national anti-poverty strategy as requiring assistance?  If that committee has not requested or organised such an audit, does it intend to do so?  It does not make sense to establish targets in a national anti-poverty strategy, implement a budget and not take into account what impact it will have on those targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined the way £20 million pounds of the £30 million youth fund to which he referred would be spent in the 13 local <Col N="659" /> drug task force areas.  Will he indicate what way the remaining £10 million will be spent and what mechanisms have been put in place to dispense that money?  He also indicated that the committee had decided on a definition of a target group. Will he indicate that definition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the chairperson of the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.  I am a member of it as are a number of my Cabinet colleagues.  On the anti-poverty strategy, the baseline document is being fed into the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and it will come before the Cabinet subcommittee.  I understand, my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, will publish that baseline document fairly soon.</P>
      <P>On the £10 million to which the Deputy referred, we are drawing up proposals on accessing that fund for submission to Government. It is expected that money will be utilised and targeted at areas outside the local drug task force areas in which there is an emerging misuse of drugs problem or the potential for such a problem to arise.  The money will also be used to support national organisations, voluntary or community organisations which have a remit or an interest in combating the misuse of drugs.  That is how the £10 million will be accessed and we will publish details on that as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the commitment and the amount of work the Minister of State has done on this issue.  Does he accept that social deprivation and educational disadvantage are at the root of the heroin problem in Dublin?  Does he also accept as some of the task forces, including the north inner city one, have communicated to him in writing, that when efforts are being made to deal with the heroin problem in one of the worst areas affected by it, in the north inner city, it does not make sense that virtually all the schools in that area have been told they are to lose teachers?  Arising from the question, will the Minister of State convey my concerns and those of the north inner city task force on this issue to the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion?  Will he ask that the decision to withdraw teachers be reviewed and reversed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Gregory's and others' comments seriously and I will convey their concerns on educational disadvantage and teachers to the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I omitted to provide information sought by Deputy De Rossa with regard to eligibility and evaluation for the young peoples' facilities and services fund.  It is a detailed document which I will make available to the Deputy.  It sets out the objectives of the fund and the guidelines.  The guidelines provide funding under five broad headings &mdash; the enhancement and integration of <Col N="660" /> existing facilities and services for young people in the target areas; the development of new viable facilities and amenities, including sporting and recreational facilities, in the areas where a gap has been identified; the development of strategies to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people into facilities; the development of additional youth services for the target group and the provision of support to voluntary and community groups and organisations working with &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people.</P>
    <P>In the past, grant aid for recreation tended to be for buildings.  We accept that they are an essential element in the fight against the misuse of drugs.  However, there are many voluntary and community organisations, including sporting and recreational organisations, operating in these areas who are strapped for cash, to put it mildly, and who spend their time trying to raise meagre resources to allow them to provide their services. This fund will address that issue.  Local clubs and organisations will be able to seek funding, not just for buildings but also to enable them to provide their services on an annual basis.  This is an important issue for many of the organisations working on a voluntary basis in the target areas to which I referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the questions put by Deputies, will the Minister of State accept that reference to deprived communities also includes educational deprivation?  Will he acknowledge that the decisions to withdraw teachers from deprived areas mentioned by Deputies impact on areas which require additional teachers and run counter to the strategy he is operating?  Will he indicate the protocols in place with regard to the management of the Cabinet subcommittee to ensure that decisions of this nature made by the Department of Education and Science are filtered through the subcommittee?  Will he indicate whether to date such decisions were raised for discussion at the subcommittee and whether he will take steps to ensure that future decisions will be discussed by the subcommittee?  Deprived communities should get additional educational facilities and not have teachers withdrawn because their schools fall one or two pupils short of the quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point seriously. I have some responsibility for advancing the work of the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs from my local development brief.  One of the approaches the subcommittee is taking is the integrated pilot project which concentrates on four areas and which has been referred to in detail in the House previously.  That project will tackle in a co-ordinated way the issues raised by Deputies.  It seeks to bring together in a focused way the operations of the major players in areas of most disadvantage to ensure co-ordination in the delivery of their services.  The pilot project will also seek to identify gaps in those services and it will have to address the issue of additionality of resources if we are to have an <Col N="661" /> impact in the areas of most disadvantage.  The issues the Deputies have raised here with regard to individual Departments will find expression through the action plans to be brought forward from the pilot projects, which I expect to bring to the Cabinet subcommittee and to the Government by the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by Deputy Gregory is obviously pressing, and very important.  Does the Minister of State accept there are much wider issues concerning educational disadvantage, which are not being tackled by the Government?  For example, since it came into office there has been no extension in the disadvantaged areas, early start and Breaking the Cycle schemes, three important elements in tackling educational disadvantage.  I stated earlier while there is activity at community level and funding is provided at task force level, community and voluntary effort cannot fill the gap which has been left by the Department of Education and Science because of the Minister's failure to provide solutions to the major problem of educational disadvantage, which is at the root of our heroin problem.  This is wider than simply an immediate problem with staffing levels.  There seems to be no indication from the Government that such disadvantage will be tackled in a serious manner.  Will the Minister of State give us a commitment that this issue will be raised as a matter of urgency at the next Cabinet subcommittee meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I already indicated my willingness to bring the concerns of the Deputies on this matter to the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion.  Education has the capacity to make an important contribution to tackling the misuse of drugs, but that does not allow other Departments off the hook.  They have a significant role to play in the manner in which they deliver services or through agencies, such as the vocational education committees and local authorities.  The failure over successive decades to provide a proper co-ordinated delivery of services, facilities and resources into areas now suffering the ravages of drug misuse is the kernel of the problem and we must intervene directly not just through one Department but in a co-ordinated way covering many Departments whether they deliver services currently or need to improve delivery with additional resources.  These issues need to be co-ordinated, otherwise, we will make little progress in tackling the underlying causes of drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education has a very important role to play, as do the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my own.  Our objective in the pilot projects is to challenge the possibility of making a significant difference in a short time.  That is why the action plan which will refer to all these issues <Col N="662" /> will be brought to the Cabinet subcommittee by me before the autumn and we are on target to achieve that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct that there must be a co-ordinated delivery of services and the cabinet subcommittee presumably oversees that and makes the decision on which services are to be provided.  My earlier question where I asked the Minster of State what audit, if any, the subcommittee has carried out on the 1998 budget in terms of the impact on the targets set in the national anti-poverty strategy is, therefore, a key question.  Is the committee having an audit carried out of the decisions made by various Departments in their input to this year's budget? What audit is being made into the impact on the targets set in the national anti-poverty strategy as a result of the budget?  That is a key question reflected in the document recently published by the Department of Education and Science and circulated to schools in areas which the current and previous Government have targeted as disadvantaged areas needing specific attention, which states they will lose teachers next September. That is not acceptable &mdash; the committee is either serious about dealing with poverty and social exclusion or it is not, and if not we should end the pretence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strongly committed to dealing with poverty and the Cabinet sub-committee has made considerable progress.  I mentioned some of the issues over which I have direct control and on which I expect to make further progress this year. The Deputy raised a number of questions on education matters which might be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>In regard to poverty proofing, one of the first issues to be addressed by the committee chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, relates to Partnership 2000, which highlights the need to strengthen administrative procedures for equality proofing in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. I understand the IDPC has met the social partners to discuss proofing policies and further meetings are planned.  A framework setting out an agreed approach to poverty proofing will be produced following consultation with all the relevant partners.  Once agreed, the proposal will be brought to the Cabinet sub-committee for approval.  That is an indication of what my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is doing and how it will be fed into the Cabinet sub-committee of which he and I are members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a number of anti-D recipients who tested negative in 1994 for hepatitis C antibodies on the confirmatory RIBA test following an initial positive ELISA test.  In 1994, a national blood screening programme was established which offered testing for women who received anti-D immunoglobulin in order to identify those who were infected with hepatitis C. Under this programme, 165 women tested positive on the initial ELISA test and negative on the confirmatory RIBA test.  International practice has been that, in the absence of RIBA positivity, the initial ELISA positive reaction probably reflected a false positive reaction.  I am advised that such non-confirmed reactions to sensitive screening tests are not uncommon in the general population.  Accordingly, when the general practitioners of the persons concerned were being advised of the test results, the results were reported as hepatitis C antibody negative.</P>
      <P>In September 1997 I established an expert group comprising, among others, consultant hepatologists, a consultant haematologist, a virologist, the chairman of the Irish College of General Practitioners, and the chairperson of Positive Action.  The group is chaired by the chief medical officer at my Department.  The remit of this group is to advise on the clinical and non-clinical management of anti-D recipients who tested negative for hepatitis C and who received infected or potentially infected product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has reviewed the position in relation to the anti-D recipients referred to by the Deputy, including the international practice already referred to.  It has decided that where such recipients have been identified as having received an infected or potentially infected anti-D batch, they should be offered referral to one of the six designated hepatology units.  The consultant in the unit will review the patient's clinical status and will conduct any further testing which <Col N="664" /> is considered necessary.  I understand that, to date, it has been confirmed that 18 of the 165 recipients did not receive infected or potentially infected anti-D.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What has acted as the catalyst to these women being recalled for further testing? Is there is a concern that they may have suffered liver damage?  Of the 165 people who initially tested positive &mdash; which result is now regarded as a false positive &mdash; has each person been communicated with on an individual basis and asked to attend for further medical testing?  What is the nature of the procedures it is proposed they undergo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress that the expert group is advising that such recipients can be reassured that all the indications from their hepatitis C tests are that they are not currently infected with hepatitis C. The ELISA test may have been a false positive result, or a low antibody response.  The overall experience is that such individuals do not have active liver disease, and it is unlikely that any further intervention such as liver biopsy will be required.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 5 June, the expert group discussed the detailed implementation of the decision to notify the women concerned, through their general practitioners &mdash; this relates to the Deputy's supplementary question.  The implementation will involve the expert group issuing comprehensive advice and information to general practitioners to ensure that they are in a position to discuss fully with their patients the circumstances of their particular situation.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the expert group is an interdisciplinary group comprising specialists in a number of areas relevant to the clinical and non-clinical management of hepatitis C patients, including Positive Action.  The approach of the group at all times is to arrive at agreed conclusions in respect of complex issues, and its primary concern is to continue to ensure maximum care for the anti-D recipients concerned.  The process of notifying the women concerned, through their general practitioners, will commence this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the Finlay report, a number of outstanding issues relevant to the testing of anti-D recipients required assessment. Positive Action mentioned two distinct groups tested under the programme &mdash; first, anti-D recipients who tested negative for hepatitis C but reported suffering jaundice following administration of anti-D; and second, those who tested negative for hepatitis C but were known to have received anti-D from infected or potentially infected batches of blood.  We therefore established an expert group to consider those issues in detail and to make recommendations.  I have stated the group's terms of reference.  They have had six meetings since November to deal with these issues in detail.  The purpose is to ensure that there is a decision making process within the expert group which deals with all outstanding <Col N="665" /> issues and allows for contacting people, giving proper counselling, and delivery of information in a correct and controlled manner to the people concerned, respecting the doctor-patient relationship. That has been the catalyst for the detailed consideration.  In some respects public comment may not get the full message across but that is what we are doing at present.</P>

      <P>On 22 May 1998 there was a total of 57,317 nurses registered with An Bord Altranais.  Of these, 47,863 were on the board's live register.</P>
      <P>The number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased steadily in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1996 the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in the public health service funded directly by my Department increased from 24,732 to 27,264 &mdash; an increase of 2,532 or 10.2 per cent.  The rate of increase in the number of nursing staff employed has been higher than that for health service employment generally over the same period.  At December 1996 the number had stabilised at 27,264.</P>
      <P>The most important point is that in recent years the traditional apprenticeship model of pre-registration nursing education and training is being replaced by a new diploma based programme. Nursing students on the programme are supernumerary to service requirements.  The traditional student nurses' service contribution is being replaced by an appropriate skill mix of qualified nurses and other grades.</P>
      <P>Because of these changes in arrangements for professional training there is an underlying trend away from less qualified student nurses to fully qualified staff nurses.  Another factor which should be taken into account is the increasing trend in recent years among health service employers to facilitate nurses who for personal reasons do not wish to commit themselves to full-time work.  There are now nearly 4,000 nurses working in formal job-sharing arrangements, in addition to the significant number who work part-time.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister did not avail of his two minutes to answer the question. He gave some background information but did not say what steps, if any, he is taking to ensure there is not a severe shortage of nurses. Many people would argue there is a severe shortage at present.  It is estimated by the INO there is a shortage of up to 1,000 nurses countrywide at the moment.  All agencies and health boards will <Col N="666" /> testify that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit nursing staff.</P>
      <P>This is happening at a time when services which require high levels of nurses are being expanded, particularly those for the elderly.  It is incredible that while services are expanding, the intake of nursing students is reducing.  It is no wonder we have a problem when that is the case.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to the Minister's attention on a number of occasions by health boards, hospitals and the INO that there is a serious problem at present, which is likely to be exacerbated over the coming years.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure we do not reach a crisis point where services are brought to a standstill because of a shortage of nurses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have increased the number of training places available this year.  Last year we did not fill our full complement of posts.  One of the reasons is that nursing must now compete with a range of career options and it is not as easy to recruit student nurses as it was in the past.</P>
      <P>We have provided a new school of nursing in the Midland Health Board, which was the only health board not to have such a school.  An additional 27 places were approved in 1998 for the schools of nursing of the Adelaide and Meath Hospitals.  Twenty five extra student places were also approved for the mental handicap nursing programme and an extra 80 places for the psychiatry programme.  Over the three year period of the programmes, this amounts to an extra 456 places.  My Department is exploring further the possibility of increasing the number of places available for students.</P>
      <P>A new nursing policy division was established in my Department.  Its primary function is to ensure there is an integrated and strengthened nursing function within my Department at this important stage in the development of nursing. There are currently eight staff working in this division. This will be augmented in the coming months when a number of nurse researchers are appointed to the division.  One of these researchers will be specifically engaged to research nursing manpower needs for the coming years.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that, unfortunately, Ireland is not in a unique position in having a shortage of nurses.  The United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Many of these countries are experiencing a large decline in the number of applicants for nurse training.  This is not yet the case in Ireland. However, we must not become complacent.  We have a declining school leaving population who have a greater range of third level courses to choose from than ever before.  This is the environment in which we must compete for student nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, my Department undertook a concerted campaign to attract more entrants to nurse training, which has been successful.  I am <Col N="667" /> most anxious to ensure the momentum generated by the campaign is sustained.  As recently as last week, when addressing the first public meeting of An Bord Altranais, I requested the board to become actively involved in the development of further promotional literature and video materials for use in an ongoing recruitment drive which it begun recently.</P>

      <Quest>the number of dialysis stations that will be open for use in Tallaght Hospital on the designated opening day out of the total number of stations for which provision has been made in the hospital; the reason all dialysis stations or units as provided for will not be available for use on that day; the arrangements, if any, made to bring the latter dialysis stations into use; and the initiative, if any, he proposes taking with regard to the serious concerns expressed by the Irish Kidney Association in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14110/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed with the management of the new hospital in Tallaght that the first task in commissioning the hospital is to transfer existing services to Tallaght and to immediately bring on stream at the new hospital those enhanced facilities which are necessary for the functioning of a major acute hospital.  These new facilities include on site laboratory services, more sophisticated theatres, state of the art sterile services, a &ldquo;best of breed&rdquo; information system/ information technology system and an ultra modern filmless radiology system known as PACS, Picture Archiving Communication System.</P>
      <P>The new hospital in Tallaght will be staffed and equipped on opening to serve dialysis patients transferring from the Meath Hospital.  This means that seven dialysis stations will be available in Tallaght.  This is the same number as currently in use in the Meath Hospital.  The dialysis service will open in Tallaght on Monday, 22 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capacity has been provided within the infrastructure to allow for an expansion to 14 stations. Additional equipment and staff will be required to commission the additional seven stations.  It is <Col N="668" /> anticipated that these facilities will come on stream from 1999 to meet the needs arising.</P>
    <P>While I cannot give any commitment at this stage regarding the quantum of funding for 1999, I am confident that additional funds will be made available to the hospital.  It will then be a matter for the hospital management to prioritise a programme of developments in the context of its 1999 service plan.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Irish Kidney Association has expressed concerns regarding the design of the new unit.  Following consultations with the management of the unit and with the South Dublin Irish Kidney Association, agreement was reached on a number of alterations to the unit.  This work has now been completed and the new unit is being commissioned.</P>
    <P>I am also aware the Irish Kidney Association is anxious that the additional stations be brought on stream as quickly as possible so that people living near to Tallaght will not have to travel elsewhere for dialysis.  I will ask the hospitals to examine the treatment locations of patients currently receiving dialysis in the Dublin area to establish the feasibility of reducing travelling times for patients following the opening of the unit at Tallaght.  Any change in the location of patients' treatments can only take place following the organisation and arrangement of such transfer by their attending medical consultant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge it is desirable that, following the opening of Tallaght Hospital, those who require dialysis and who live within the catchment area of the hospital should be able to obtain that procedure in Tallaght without having to travel to other parts of Dublin?  Is the Minister aware there is considerable concern in the Irish Kidney Association that the seven dialysis stations will be inadequate to meet the need the hospital will have to service?  Does he have any plans to provide any additional funding to the hospital within the next few weeks to allow at least some of the additional dialysis stations to be brought on stream this year rather than in 1999?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the position clear that the transfer of existing services requires the opening of seven stations.  I am confident and optimistic that the 14 stations will come on stream in 1999. I am not in a position to enhance the service in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been ensuring that some of the issues raised by the Irish Kidney Association are dealt with.  Building adjustments have been completed, including reducing the size of bulkheads, relocating the nurses' station and removal of screens and showers, largely to increase space and improve access to the dialysis stations.  We are now ready to commission the seven stations.  The commitment has been at all times to transfer existing services in the current year.  There will obviously be a transitional period.  Over time people from that area will want to relocate their dialysis treatment <Col N="669" /> services to Tallaght, and that is understandable. We will have to configure the existing services within Dublin to facilitate Tallaght Hospital coming on stream but the 14 stations will not be available on day one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that it is inefficient use of resources and contrary to the community catchment ethos of Tallaght Hospital that people who live in Tallaght may still have to go to Beaumont Hospital for dialysis? Does he regard that as acceptable or unacceptable?  Will he clarify why the dialysis stations as originally constructed did not meet the purposes for which they are required?  Will he indicate to the House the additional cost of rearranging the stations and explain why the Irish Kidney Association was not consulted in the con-text of the construction of this aspect of the hospital and difficulties arose with regard to this aspect of the hospital of a similar nature to difficulties that arose in other parts of the hospital?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the exact cost of the changes because the final contractual arrangements with the builder have not been concluded. That is under negotiation, so even if I had the information it would not be prudent to give it.  I have outlined the nature of the changes and they do not seem to have been major.

The other issues to be addressed are also legitimate ones regarding the enhanced level of treatment services in Tallaght over and above the existing dialysis services in the Meath Hospital. They will have to be addressed over time.</P>

      <P>My Department has been in touch with the Rotunda Hospital which has assured the Department that this procedure was introduced as part of the <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation service offered by a private clinic at the hospital only after the <Col N="670" /> most rigorous examination of the medical, legal and ethical aspects of the procedure.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Irish Medical Council is reviewing its code of ethical guidelines relating to assisted human reproduction and I am awaiting the publication of those guidelines.  My Department has had no communication with the Clane Clinic.</P>
      <P>The legal implications of this procedure are being considered by my Department.  When this process has been completed I will take the appropriate next steps.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the status of a child born as a result of embryo freezing is that where the gametes, eggs and sperm, of a couple are used there is no difficulty.  However, where donor gametes are used the status of any child born has not been specifically addressed.  To date there has been a presumption of paternity of the husband as provided for in the Status of Children Act, 1987.</P>

Is he telling the House that he is abdicating his role to the Irish Medical Council?  Will he indicate whether he regards this issue as too hot to handle?  Is he unwilling to look at what legislative initiatives are necessary in this area?  Will he not accept that his Department has a very specific responsibility with regard to children to redress issues in the area of children's law in which currently there is a vacuum which will inevitably result in substantial difficulties having to be resolved by the courts if the Minister does not have the courage to address these areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal implications of these procedures are under consideration by the Department and I have not yet been advised what the final position is or where we should go from here.  In addition, a review is being undertaken by the Irish Medical Council and I would like to see what that review throws up to be informed on <Col N="671" /> all aspects, medical issues, ethical issues and legal issues.  I want to try to get a handle on all of those complex areas before deciding what to do about them.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the nature of the review conducted so far by the Department, and the nature of the research if any into the legal systems or legislation available within other countries to address these areas?  Will he acknowledge that there are two different areas of legal problem, one the parentage of children born as a result of donor ova or donor sperm, and the other the legal procedures relating to conception and the ownership of zygotes or embryos which result from the use of these procedures, their future, and the manner in which they can be used for assisted reproduction mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that broadly those are the two areas that are thrown up when one considers the implications of availability of these procedures here.  There are many issues involved.  I have to examine the ethical, medical and legal implications.  The Department, in its consideration of these matters highlights the areas of concern.  The Deputy has outlined some of them.  It has to be decided what may need to be regulated and what does not need to be regulated, whether legislation is required, and whether guidelines for the Institute of Gynaecologists to cover this issue would be relevant. We have to try to get a handle on these issues and get all the advice we can on how to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's suggestion, it is not a case of the issue being too hot to handle but of giving it the detailed consideration required so that there is some prospect of regulating the situation over and above the position as it now stands.  Clearly medical science is advancing in terms of assisted human reproduction and the issues relating to it will come up for consideration at some stage.</P>

The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority <Col N="672" /> in my Department's health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and a consultant-led service is now available in each health board.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of formulating a policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services which will include consideration of the specific needs of children with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I understand that the policy document will be completed and available for consideration by me at an early date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That point has been made by the group of parents who have children with this disorder. I have heard also from other parents of autistic children that the failure to clinically assess the nature of the child's requirements at an earlier date has determined the extent to which the matter can be resolved and people can get on with their lives in an appropriate way.  Deputy Neville is probably correct when he says that, similar to other child disorders, this disorder is not being identified early enough.  I have asked for a review of child and adolescent psychiatric services which will include consideration of this issue, which was brought to my attention by the Deputy and others.

The Deputy is now asking me to confirm that our paediatric profession can identify this disorder.  I have no evidence that that is the case.  It may well be that the way we deliver the service has been such that people do not get access to specialist expertise in time.  I do not want to say that our paediatricians are incapable of identifying the syndrome when they examine these patients.  It is the view of parents whom I have met that this is the case.  I have asked that this particular disorder, <Col N="673" /> which to my knowledge is of relatively recent vintage, be included in the review currently taking place in relation to child and adolescent psychiatric services.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officers of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66 to 79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above, the Government has identified as a key priority in An Action Programme for the Millennium a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families, and my Department has asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to consider the commitment and to give their views to the Department as to how the commitment might be implemented, and the implications, financial and otherwise, of their proposals. <Col N="674" /> The chief executive officers intend to submit their views to the Department shortly.</P>

I cannot be accused of being unsympathetic to a proposal that is now getting consideration for the first time.  The general rule is that, because of the pressing needs on the health services, we do not decide on eligibility for medical cards beyond income eligibility.  There are income limits but a residual discretion is available to the chief executive officers in cases where people are above those limits.  In relation to the principle, I am far from being unsympathetic but I am anxious to get the views of the chief executive officers on this matter before decisions are taken.</P>

Many of these people worked for more than 40 years, contributed to an occupational pension and then received their social welfare pension, which took them above the threshold.  Will the Minister agree that on the grounds of fairness to those people who have never been a burden on the State they should now be granted medical cards in the final years of their lives as I believe is their right? Rather than just passing the buck as a delaying tactic and looking for the views of the chief executive officers of health boards, the Minister <Col N="675" /> should take the proper action and grant these people their entitlement.</P>

I presume the Deputy believes this is a right to which people were entitled prior to 26 June last.  In the previous four years her party was in Government and did nothing about it.  Far from passing the buck, this Government is giving the matter detailed examination. I am not unsympathetic to the case.  Once I get the information from the chief executive officers I will consider the position with a view to resolving it.  I agree with Deputy Shortall that there may be a case in regard to many of the people in receipt of small State pensions in addition to their old age pension.  That is the reason this matter was included both in the manifesto and in the programme for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of homeless young people presenting themselves at Garda stations for short-term accommodation is a problem mainly in the Dublin city centre.  Prior to the establishment of the <Col N="676" /> out of hours service in 1992 the Eastern Health Board, which has responsibility for child care services in that area, reached agreement with the Garda at Assistant Commissioner level that young people could access social workers via a Garda station.  This was considered to be a safe place for the young person and the social worker alike.  No facility was sought or provided and young people are met by social workers at the reception area of Garda stations.  In practice, a handful of Dublin city centre Garda stations receive most of the young people requesting a service during the out of hours period.  There is a group of young people who present themselves on a recurring basis.</P>
    <P>To relieve this position and to improve its crisis intervention service generally, the Eastern Health Board plans to open its own reception centre where young people can access the out of hours service.  The new facility will be professionally staffed and will provide food, laundry, washing and toilet facilities in a comfortable and safe environment.  It is planned that this service will open at a city centre location during 1998.  In addition to this reception centre, the Eastern Health Board will also open an additional residential centre specifically for young people who currently call to Garda stations on a regular basis seeking accommodation through the out of hours service.  The new residential centre, which will be on-stream in 1998, will care for young people who are often excluded from other services because of their behaviour or active drug use.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area homeless young people who do not wish to avail of the services offered to them by the health board are advised that if they feel unsafe or get into difficulties they can go to a Garda station.  In such case the Garda are notified by the health board of the services available.  If a young person who has not been in contact with the health board comes to the notice of the Garda out of hours, the Garda will contact the child care emergency residential facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the Minister's reply developments are under way in terms of services provided by the Eastern Health Board.  The one area of service provision which is falling behind in terms of homeless children is education &mdash; this matter was raised during questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Flood.  There is no safety net in place.  Will the Minister accept that school truancy should be his responsibility?  With better co-ordination of services to identify children who drop out of school at an early stage and a follow through by social work services, the number of children presenting themselves at Garda stations would be much reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, I have responsibility for truancy and absence from school.  I agree this is one of the contributing <Col N="677" /> factors towards homelessness, but it is only one of a number of complex reasons for homelessness. Others include dysfunctional families, abuse or neglect in the home, the absence of a proper support and welfare service and proper support in ensuring children go to school.  Those problems are being tackled in a variety of ways.  We are involved in a series of initiatives to get to grips with homelessness and dysfunction in families where children find it necessary to leave home. Initiatives will be announced in a series of areas in the coming months.  The Government, through the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, is determined to get to grips with difficulties facing families, particularly in working class areas, which lead to the inevitability of children becoming homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that pilot schemes are not sufficient to deal with child homelessness?  What is needed is a proper educational service in areas of disadvantage to reduce class sizes and ensure additional supports are available in schools.  There has been no expansion of the disadvantaged scheme, Breaking the Cycle scheme or the early start programme. Will the Minister agree education spending must be targeted in areas of severe disadvantage? What initiatives has he taken to tackle the problem of truancy?  There has been no evidence in the past year that anything is being done about those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the need for additional education expenditure on the programmes to which the Deputy referred is necessary and desirable. The Minister for Education and Science is seeking more resources for that area, but the problem is a little more complex than that.  One of the major difficulties is to get young people to attend school.  Significant additional resources must be made available for parenting and pre-school programmes to ensure children go to school.  The major problem in terms of school truancy relates to the family background.  Extra resources have been made available to health boards and they are engaged in initiatives in this regard.</P>
      <P>I dispute the point about pilot projects.  Up to now there has been no proper co-ordination between Departments in tackling this issue.  It has been decided to set up a number of pilot projects. Next Monday the Taoiseach will launch a national scheme in this area.  I spent this morning in west Tallaght where I saw some of the difficulties experienced and some of the work being done. There is no doubt the only way forward is by preventative strategies and intervention at an early stage to protect children and give them the support they do not get from their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>Cardiac surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres.  Adult cardiac surgery is performed at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis.  At the end of December 1997, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,150 patients awaiting cardiac bypass surgery.  Information is not routinely collected by the agencies in the format requested by the Deputies.  However, I am consulting with the hospitals involved about the possibility of getting data in the format requested and will communicate with the Deputies on the matter in due course.</P>
      <P>In 1997, my Department allocated a sum of £1.7 million under the waiting list initiative with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children.  A combination of approaches was used by hospitals to achieve this objective.  As well as purchasing additional cardiac surgery procedures, patients were also reassessed with a view to using alternative therapies such as interventional cardiology or medical treatment, as clinically appropriate.  1 am pleased to say this initiative was very successful in reducing the adult waiting list by 203 between September and December 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year a sum of £3 million is being made available specifically for cardiac surgery patients. As in 1997, the aim will be to reduce the overall numbers waiting for cardiac surgery and it is expected that the successful strategy applied in <Col N="679" /> 1997 will be adopted again.  Final decisions on the allocation of the cardiac initiative funding will be announced shortly and I am confident this will have a positive impact on both the overall numbers waiting and the average waiting times. However, I am not in a position to be definite about year end figures, given the difficulty in predicting with accuracy how demand will evolve over the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of cardiovascular services generally, the Deputy will be aware that on 29 January 1998 1 announced a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease, with a particular emphasis on premature mortality. Included in this was approval for the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway, with the capacity to carry out an additional 750 cardiac surgery procedures per annum.  The development of these facilities in the next couple of years should result in a significant reduction in the number of patients waiting for cardiac surgery. More importantly, my aim is to ensure that over the next three or four years as a result of this substantial infrastructural development and cardiac surgery waiting list initiative funding, the average waiting time for cardiac surgery will be reduced to six months.</P>
    <P>Having approved these developments in surgical capacity, I propose to address the wider issues surrounding cardiovascular disease, prevention and treatment when I receive the report of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group which I established in March of this year.  The group has been asked to report to me by the end of the summer this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it is unsatisfactory that, on 16 June l998, he is unaware of any changes in the cardiac waiting list since December l997?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a capital requirement, to which the £3 million does not apply.  That is a Revenue figure to cover existing capacity and the purchase of extra capacity.  The Galway project is part of the development control plan which I <Col N="680" /> approved some months ago and will proceed as part of the building phase as planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy tables a specific question on that matter I will give him a detailed answer.  I expect it will be during this Government's tenure of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that, for political reasons, the Minister announced the provision of extra capacity in Galway Hospital without allocating any resources or giving a timescale for when it will be provided?  Does he agree that, to his embarrassment, he was gazumped by his colleague sitting beside him in terms in that announcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect on all fronts.  It is amazing that Deputy Shatter should regard any significant capital investment outside Dublin as being for political reasons.  It is not for political reasons, it is for medical reasons in the interest of maintaining regional self-sufficiency and entitlement to the people of the west, as the enhanced capacity in St. James's will improve matters for people on the eastern seaboard in terms of cardiac surgery.  The idea that a uniform quality service is being provided throughout the country for political reasons says more about the Deputy's attitude than mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows what I meant by my reference to political reasons.  He is aware I agree with the proposed plans for Galway. However, does he agree he has announced plans without making the funding available to implement them or prescribing a timescale within which he can guarantee the people of Galway he will provide the additional capacity?  Is that not the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position.  The provision of cardiac surgery facilities is included in the next phase of development at Galway University Hospital.  As I announced on 29 January, this has been funded and set out in the strategy.  There is no question of gazumping or side-tracking on the issue.  We have given a firm commitment on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <P>Members will have learned, with regret, of the death of Paudge Brennan, a distinguished former Member of the House.  May he rest in peace.  Paudge was born in Carnew in County Wicklow some 76 years ago.  He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in l954, regaining the seat held by his late father, Tom, from l944 until 1953.</P>
      <P>Paudge diligently served the people of Wicklow continuously until l973.  He was returned again for the constituency in June l981 and November l982.  He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the late Mr. Neil Blaney and Mr. Kevin Boland when they were Ministers.  He held this position from l965 until l970.  He was a Taoiseach's nominee to the Seanad from April to November l982 and retired from national politics in l987.</P>
      <P>At a local level, Paudge also served the people of Wicklow well as a member of Wicklow County Council.  He was a member of Wicklow County Committee of Agriculture and a distinguished member of the General Council of County Councils for many years.  He took a special interest in vocational education and particularly in education in Carnew.  He was also a member of the European Conference on Local Authorities from l961 until l965.</P>
      <P>The people of Wicklow will be particularly saddened in view of the tremendous service he gave to that county throughout the years.  He was instrumental in bringing Nitrogen Éireann, now known as IFI, to Arklow.</P>
      <P>Paudge was a keen and skilled footballer.  He represented his club, Carnew, with great distinction for many years.  He also played for the Wicklow senior team for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Paudge well before and after I was elected to this House 21 years ago today.  He was always helpful to me as a newcomer to the Dáil. The huge attendance at his funeral mass and at <Col N="683" /> the removal of his remains showed that Paudge was still held in high regard in Carnew.  The mass last Saturday was attended by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer our deepest condolences to his widow, Mary, his daughters, Jo, Rosemary and Sally, his sons, Tom, Sean and Barry, his brothers, Fr. Crispin OFM Cap.  and Michael, and his sisters, Dolores, Sr. Immaculata and Sr. Frances.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>Mr. Paudge Brennan was one of the last men in Irish politics to resign from ministerial office on the basis of principle.  He did not have to resign in 1970 but he took a stand and gave up ministerial office because of his beliefs. Many may not agree with those beliefs but they were sincerely held.  It was the courage he showed on that occasion which probably marks him out from most of us in this House.  He was an exceptional man for taking such an historic step in 1970.  The last similar case which I recall related to Mr. Paddy Smith who resigned four or five years earlier in objection to wage policies being pursued at that time by Mr. Seán Lemass.  It has not happened since then.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that Mr. Paudge Brennan was a man of great physical and moral courage.  His physical courage was displayed on the football field.  He was a distinguished Wicklow footballer.  It was recalled in the Seanad that Paudge Brennan played on the Wicklow team which played 11 minutes of extra time against Meath.  As soon as Meath pulled a point ahead, the whistle was blown.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Paudge Brennan's career would have been even more distinguished if Wicklow had been successful on that occasion.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources said, Paudge was also a successful member of the local authority.  He first stood for the Dáil in a by-election in 1953 but was defeated by the late Mr. Mark Deering who was elected for Fine Gael.  Paudge was elected to the Dáil in the general election of 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to one of his long serving colleagues and a former Deputy, Mr. Godfrey Timmins, in the past few hours about Paudge.  He said something to me which most of us in this House will understand from our experience of going to public meetings with colleagues from different parties and perhaps being told beforehand that a colleague from a different party would say X and then finding that he had said X, Y and Z which left one at a disadvantage because there had been a change in tactic.  Mr. Godfrey Timmins said that <Col N="684" /> Paudge Brennan was the most honest and straightforward person he had ever known in politics.  He did not qualify that by reference to any other party.  He made an unqualified statement that he was a man of his word in everything he said and did.  That is praise coming from somebody who shared a constituency with him for such a long period.  Paudge was exceptional.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and to all his friends in County Wicklow and throughout Ireland who felt a great loss at the death of Paudge Brennan.  Although we were in the House together, I would not claim to have known him personally to the extent that many others did who have spoken and will speak in the future.  I convey the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party to his widow and family in their irreplaceable loss.</P>

I want to correct the record in relation to resignations on principle.  The record will show that Mr. Frank Cluskey was the last person who decided for reasons of policy to resign from a Cabinet position.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that, the point was well made by Deputy John Bruton that it was an issue of principle held dearly by Paudge Brennan, one with which I would have disagreed at the time and with which I now disagree but times have moved on.</P>
      <P>There is a lesson for all of us in the selfless service that Paudge Brennan has given to our society and the Republic.  In these times, when the profession of politicians and politics is denigrated by many commentators and people on the periphery of politics, we must remember the work, long hours, dedication, selflessness and self-effacement that Paudge Brennan displayed. He was a self-effacing man who was typical of the type of people we have come to expect will represent the constituency of Wicklow.  He had a long and productive life in political terms and he has made a contribution which will stand the test of time and will be seen by those in his party, his family, his children and his grandchildren.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our condolences to his family and to the Fianna Fáil Party which has lost a trusted and loyal colleague.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Tánaiste who cannot be here today and the Progressive Democrats, I want to be associated with the sentiments and tributes which have been paid to the late Paudge Brennan.  I did not have the pleasure of knowing this gentleman but I am informed that he played an active part in political life over four decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> He was also involved in sport.  Many former Deputies were involved in Gaelic games at senior level and this is often a feature of the tributes we pay to them.  I am glad Deputy Fox is continuing the tradition of involvement in Gaelic football in Wicklow.  It is remarkable that so many former Deputies were active participants in Gaelic games.  Such participation does not seem to happen today.</P>
    <P>Despite suffering a defeat at the polls in 1979, former Deputy and Senator, Mr. Paudge Brennan, returned to the Dáil in 1981.  I am sure his death is a great loss to his wife and six children. I offer my sympathy and that of my party to his family and Fianna Fáil colleagues.</P>

      <P>I convey my sympathy to the family and party colleagues of the late Paudge Brennan who served for a long time in public life and was elected in seven general elections.  He is known in political circles and outside Wicklow as having resigned his seat as a Minister on a point of principle.  As other Deputies have said the point of principle was one which they and I would have disagreed with, and would have been critical of at the time but it is noteworthy that he did so.  It is not something one hears too often.  Mr. Frank Cluskey did so on a point of principle but it is a rare enough thing.  I am sure the family of Paudge Brennan, and Paudge himself, would like him to be remembered for the service he gave over such a long period to his constituents and the people of this country.  I am certain there were many things he was responsible for achieving during that time which will never be mentioned except in his family circle or in his own party circles in Wicklow but, nevertheless, all of which helped to make the kind of society we have today.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I express my sympathy on the death of Paudge Brennan to his family, friends and former political colleagues.  Having been elected in 1954 he predates my time and I admit I did not know him.  I know from the times in which he lived, which are of considerable interest to people looking at this country's history, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, that he was a major figure as parliamentary secretary to Kevin Boland in 1965.  He resigned in 1970 on a point of principle in support of Kevin Boland.  His outside politics activity as a county footballer will be as important as his political contribution.  To many of us in politics he is to be envied for having topped the poll in all elections up to 1969 and would have to be considered a colossus in political terms on that great achievement.  He would be known to subscribe to the phrase &mdash; having left Fianna Fáil along with the late Deputy Blaney and the former Deputy Boland &mdash;&ldquo;we did not leave Fianna Fáil, it left us.&rdquo; I am not sure exactly who uttered those words first but some would say it was Paudge Brennan.  Having returned to Fianna Fáil he is known to have said he wished to instil some Republican principle in <Col N="686" /> the party.  He can rest in peace if he has been convinced of that.</P>
      <P>He shared my interest in education, having been chairman of the VEC.  With many people in this House and outside, he shared a keen interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  Given the evolving situation in the peace process and the Assembly elections, relations on this island have reached a stage which will allow him and many others who have gone from us to rest in peace.

      <P>I offer in a special way my condolences and that of the Blaney families, the people of Donegal and the constituency of Connacht-Ulster, with whom he was very much associated, on the death of a friend and colleague, Paudge Brennan.  His late father served here as a Deputy for Wicklow for about ten years along with my father.  He unsuccessfully contested the by-election, following his father's death, in 1953.  He was elected for the first time in a general election in 1954 and was re-elected in each successive general election until 1973.  He was re-elected in 1981 and 1982 and served for a further five years and retired in 1987.</P>
      <P>Following the general election he became parliamentary secretary to my brother, Neil, as Minister for Local Government.  He continued in that position until Kevin Boland became Minister for Local Government in 1966.  He resigned his position following the dismissal of Charles Haughey and my late brother, Neil, during the arms trial. In 1970 he unsuccessfully contested the general election as an Independent.  In 1973 he remained a faithful friend and colleague and became director of elections for Connacht-Ulster during the 1979 European elections for our organisation.  He helped to secure the highest vote ever recorded for any one candidate for my late brother, Neil T. Blaney, who topped the poll with 81,500 votes. He became director of elections in Donegal North East for my own Independent Fianna Fáil organisation in the 1996 by-election.  It was obvious he was not in the best of health at that time.  He was unable to resume that position for the general election in 1997.  Nevertheless he came to Donegal for the last two weeks of that campaign and helped in no small way to secure the seat which we, Independent Fianna Fáil, lost the previous year and which we now hold.</P>
      <P>The friendship with the Brennan family goes back many years.  Paudge was a loyal and dedicated friend in good times and not so good.  He loved Irish traditions and Irish culture.  He came from a Republican background and held Republican beliefs until his death.  May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to add my voice to that of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, and other party leaders in this tribute to the late Paudge Brennan.  Paudge <Col N="687" /> Brennan was a fine human being and a great Irishman.  He served in both Houses of the Oireachtas for many years and in Government. His contribution to the lives of the people of Wicklow and his work for them is appreciated and will long be remembered.  He was a county councillor and sat on many of the council's subcommittees and was very successful so far as his constituents were concerned.</P>
      <P>As stated by Deputy Bruton he was an accomplished footballer.  He wore his county jersey with great pride.  He played with his native Carnew well past his sell by date as a footballer. His club, Carnew, and my old club are often said to have done their business on the field of play in a rather robust fashion.  In deference to what has been said by Deputy Bruton, Paudge could take care of himself in that department also.  With those two teams, those two clubs and those two communities there was never anything untoward. The attributes of honesty and manliness was always present and were part and parcel of Paudge Brennan.  Indeed, those attributes resulted in a great bond of life long friendships between individuals from those two communities and a deep respect for each other on and off the field of play.  As a result Paudge benefited greatly and made many friends in his sporting career which stood him well in other aspects of life, particularly in his political career.</P>
      <P>His wife, Mary, was an integral part of everything he did.  It was the greatest partnership I have ever known in politics.  Obviously all our partners play a huge part in the whole process. There was something extraordinary about the relationship between Paudge and Mary.  When speaking at functions in the constituency, he never failed to mention that and to highlight and portray his great appreciation of her work and the great strength she was to him.  That pride which she will have in the memory of Paudge will stand her well now in this time of great grief.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil organisation in the Wicklow constituency and the people of County Wicklow, I extend deepest sympathy to Mary, her sons and daughters, and their wider family.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points mentioned in each contribution is &ldquo;principle&rdquo;.  Paudge Brennan certainly was a man of principle, but he was a man who did not allow his principles to get in the way of personal friendships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For me growing up as a child, general elections in Wicklow meant nailing posters, licking envelopes and Paudge Brennan calling for tea.  I was happy to be able to call to the Brennan household for tea during the last general election.  In the week before the British-Irish Agreement referendum, I was also happy to call to his house and listen to his views on the various matters of the day.  He was never slow to express his views and he always stood by them.  I do not know whether there would be a role for him in today's life <Col N="688" /> because where shadows supersede substance, Paudge did not want to be.</P>
    <P>He had a great love for the GAA.  He won a minor championship medal with Carnew in 1938. One could almost set one's watch by him walking down Emmet St. to Croke Park on a sunny Sunday right up virtually to the time of his death.  As often as he could be found in Croke Park supporting Wicklow footballers &mdash; Deputy Bruton alluded to the fact that that was not often &mdash; or Wexford hurlers, he could also be found in Aughrim on a wet winter's Sunday afternoon attending a league or club match.</P>
    <P>He is a great loss to Carnew, Wicklow and everybody who knew him.  I suppose in every locality or county when somebody dies a certain part of that locality dies for a generation &mdash; think of Christy Ring and Cloyne.  In Carnew, and particularly the main street, a certain part of that area has died with the sad passing of Paudge Brennan.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, he was able to go out until the last day or two before his death and on the Saturday week before he died I met him when President McAleese opened the Carnew community housing project.</P>
    <P>To his family, his wife, Mary, his sons, Tom, Seán and Barry, his daughters, Jo, Rosemary and Sally, and his brothers and sisters, I extend my sincere sympathy.  If it is any consolation to his family, they can rest assured that every night he laid his head to rest he slept with a clear mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things which will always remind me of Paudge Brennan.  He was a man of quite remarkable natural grace.  In fact, he had a grace which set him apart among men. He had a unique way of expressing himself and understanding other people's point of view.</P>
      <P>Paudge will always be fondly remembered because of his perpetual good humour.  He could always see the funny side of life as well as seeing the serious side.  Whenever he told a story, it was laced, as you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with acute observations on the frailty of the human condition.</P>
      <P>Paudge was a man of extraordinarily robust principles, as has already been referred to here. His darkest hour and, in fact, his brightest moment was in the early 1970s, a troubled period for Irish politics.  Paudge had to make a choice. He was an officeholder, a junior Minister.  His decisions on that occasion were informed not by the need to be in office but by the needs of principles. Paudge and his family paid a big price but he was not bitter; they were not bitter.  His response was always philosophical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paudge was a man of great loyalty to his family, his county and his place, his political philosophy which was stoutly and proudly republican, and, above all, to this country.  Paudge loved this country. He loved all 32 counties.  He loved the people and their cultural diversity.  He was delighted, for example, that the present bi-centenary celebrations for 1798 celebrated the diversity of the <Col N="689" /> rebellion, recognising the part played by protestant and dissenter as well as by catholic.  Paudge Brennan's republicanism recognised that that philosophy demanded an understanding of the diversity of this nation, and a respect and joy in its diverse traditions.</P>
    <P>In these times when politics and politicians are universally questioned and are sometimes the subject of understandable cynicism, we can hold Paudge Brennan up as a bright symbol of unquestionable integrity to which politics must and should aspire and be returned.  Politics for Paudge was never about self-serving, but about serving the people and, above all, the nation.  I know that the recent revelations caused him much pain.  He simply could not understand how anybody who had been honoured by public office could besmirch public office by betraying the public's trust.  That was something which was quite alien to him.</P>
    <P>There was another side to Paudge which I grew to know, love and cherish over the years, and that was the family man.  Paudge has left behind a quite remarkable family: Mary, his wife and lifelong companion, and his six children, Tom, Seán, Barry, Jo, Rosemary and Sally, their husbands and wives, and the grandchildren.  They dealt with Paudge's illness and with his parting with the greatest dignity.  Their pain will, I have no doubt, be soothed by the knowledge that he had and still holds the respect and regard not only of the people of County Wicklow but also the people who represent the nation.</P>
    <P>In Carnew church at the end of Paudge's funeral Mass, Barry Brennan described his father as a class act.  That he was and will be very hard to follow.</P>

      <P>I extend my sympathy and the sympathy of Democratic Left in County Wicklow to the family of Paudge Brennan.  He was, as has been said, a man of great principle and strong convictions.  His integrity was recognised by those who did not necessarily share those convictions but could see the integrity in the man.  He was also courageous and he fought his last illness with great courage.</P>
      <P>I record my thanks and my debt to him for his kindness, the small remembered acts of kindness which unfortunately seem to be less prevalent in politics nowadays.  He was very much a man of old style courtesy.  As a newcomer starting out on the slippery slope which leads to this House, I was grateful that Paudge always had time to talk to somebody like me.  It did not matter to him to whom he was talking, from where the person came, or whether the person was important in political terms.  He was always willing to talk and he extended a warmth and kindness which will certainly stay with me.</P>
      <P>The great crowd which turned out in Carnew to go with him on his last journey was an indication of the range of his friends.  There were so many of all political persuasions and none, who came out of regard, respect and love.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> My deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Mary, &mdash; local people often call her Mary Paudge &mdash; his sons and daughters, and his brothers and sisters. He is a great loss to County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>I want to be associated with the tributes being paid to Paudge Brennan.  Our paths first crossed in 1982 when he and my father shared the Fianna Fáil ticket for the general election. Even though that might not be the best start in the world to any friendship, they remained firm friends until my father died in 1995.</P>
      <P>Paudge and his wife, Mary, were very kind to me during both my by-election and general election campaigns.  They invited all my supporters in for tea and they would actually get annoyed with me if they heard I was in Carnew and failed to drop in on them.</P>
      <P>Paudge was a well respected man in County Wicklow, especially around Carnew.  That was evident by the tributes which were paid to him on the night.  Paudge had strong beliefs and he stood up for them, even if that meant going it alone.  He must be respected for that.  I extend my sympathy to Mary and his family on behalf of my supporters in County Wicklow.</P>

Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the Government has decided that between now and the end of June, notwithstanding any commitments into which the Irish public entered in the referendum, it will not bring forward legislation to deal with the release of prisoners under licence as set out in the British-Irish Agreement?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 7, after &ldquo;ON&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND EXTENDED&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation which outlines the thinking of successive Governments.  The Bill makes provision for the future of Bord na Móna. It will have important consequences for the board in the next 25 to 30 years.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate the important work undertaken by the board over the past 50 years, especially in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  At that time people had great vision, courage and persistence to identify and commercialise one of our great natural resources.  Vast tracts of bogland across the midlands were developed, which made a huge contribution to the economic development of the State.  This led to jobs in many regions where there had been very little employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment and amendments Nos. 5 and 6 which seek to extend the remit of Bord na Móna.  The board produces peat which is delivered to electricity generating stations for use in the production of electricity.  Heretofore, it was circumscribed that electricity had to be provided by the ESB, but with the opening up of the electricity generating market IVO is producing electricity in the new station in the Edenderry area.  The ESB is confident that it will be able to compete successfully with IVO.</P>
      <P>This legislation should provide that Bord na Móna should be given the opportunity to enter the electricity generating market if it wishes to do so.  It has a natural resource and the necessary expertise to enter a joint venture to do that.  It is likely that in future years Bord na Móna may wish to enter a joint venture or set up a joint partnership with the ESB, an international or multinational company.  That would be compatible with its history.  In the past people in Bord na Móna displayed great vision and courage and the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill would benefit the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister represents a neighbouring constituency. Bord na Móna's life may extend to 25 or 30 years, but if it was granted additional powers, as sought in this amendment, its future would be guaranteed beyond that time.  I am not referring only to the production of electricity but that it should be allowed to become involved in a considerable number of other enterprises.  It is involved in engineering and other commercial enterprises and in the past it was involved in enterprises related to trees and vegetables.  It should be given power by statute to expand into many other commercial ventures.  Such power would safeguard its future not only for the next 25 years but into the future.  I hope the Minister can accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>The group of amendments tabled by the Fine Gael Party essentially seek to expand the remit of Bord na Móna.  I have no difficulty with that general principle, but I would be concerned about specifying areas into which Bord na Móna could expand.  There is a danger in that because it might seem to indicate that areas outside those specified might be excluded.  The generality of the Acts that empower Bord na Móna to engage in its business are better than specifying a short list of specific areas.  I would be concerned that such a list would make Bord na Móna stick to its knitting.  I know where that phrase originated. It was used by the Minister's predecessor, but he did not come up with it.  That might be the effect of this amendment as proposed.  Perhaps we could reconsider the powers the two Acts give Bord na Móna rather than including a short list of additional powers.</P>

      <P>I understand where Deputy Enright is coming from.  We represent neighbouring constituencies and Deputy Stagg represents one beside Deputy Enright's.  I discussed this matter with Deputy Currie on Committee Stage. Section 5 of the 1990 Act states the board may, inside or outside the State, engage in all such commercial activities, whether in relation to the production or marketing of turf or otherwise, as in the opinion of the board arise out of and can advantageously be conducted in conjunction with any function of the board.  We have considered this matter in detail and section 5 of the 1990 Act allows the board to engage in any commercial activity without the need to list what it might do. It would be restrictive to list the activities in which it might engage.  In recent years it has branched out into peat based environmental applications, electricity generation and into the coal business through its acquisitions of CDL and Suttons.  The 1990 Act was very far-reaching and developmental in its approach.  I hope the Deputy will accept what I am saying because it is better that board should have a wide-ranging rather than a restrictive function.  The 1990 Act fulfils what the Deputy proposes in his amendment.</P>

      <P>I discussed this matter with Deputy Currie who had to leave the House because of an engagement.  He conveyed the Minister's views to me which I carefully considered. I appreciate what the Minister said about section 5 of the 1990 Act which gives the board the opportunity to expand.  However, my amendment seeks an expanded mandate to allow the board to develop in the new market that has come about with the liberalisation of the electricity market.  As the Minister stated, Bord na Móna has been involved in many activities, not only in those related to turf production.  My amendment seeks to provide for that in the Bill and I ask the Minister to accept it, but I do not know if she will.  We need to ensure the future of Bord na Móna is safeguarded and that is why I <Col N="698" /> want to give it the opportunity to expand into those areas.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the good motives behind the Deputy's amendment, but the 1990 Act allows the board to engage in any activity in which it wishes to engage inside or outside the State as long as it considers such activity would be in its interests and developmental.  The functions referred to by the Deputy include electricity production, the board's land bank and its engineering resources, but under the 1990 Act the board has expanded into areas beyond that because it had the scope to do so under section 5 of that Act.  I understand the Deputy's point.  The 1990 Act deals with it.</P>

      <P>This amendment arose from the debate on Committee Stage.  We considered the arguments put and the legal advice available to me is that section 9(5) and section 50 should be retained but amended to reflect the Deputy's concerns.  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 20 which would result in the deletion of section 9(5) and section 50.  I propose two amendments which retain the basic thrust of the provisions as published but remove any element which might be deemed unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>We discussed the arguments made by Deputy Stagg and took legal advice.  The amendments will allow, where necessary, for the automatic adaptation of other enactments to ensure their application to the new company and its subsidiaries where such enactments apply currently to functions of the board and where these functions are transferred to the company or its subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>On legal advice I propose another amendment to delete section 3(1) and as a result of this deletion a drafting amendment is required which is proposed in amendment No. 3.  We have sought to address the Deputy's concerns about constitutionality.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 35, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and what I was trying to do then was misunderstood. I want to ensure that where an individual unknowingly commits a crime, he or she cannot be convicted automatically.  There is ample precedent in law for this.  The best example is in our ethics legislation where if a person does not notify a conflict of interest, various sanctions can be imposed, but where it is demonstrated it is not knowingly omitted, a committee of the House would take that into consideration and the sanctions would depend on the degree of knowingness involved.  The Minister said she would look at this issue again.</P>
      <P>My view is that it is bad law because it excludes the possibility of a person inadvertently breaking the law and that inadvertence should be catered for in the legislation, otherwise, an individual who makes a mistake could be convicted.  This is worth considering and, perhaps, comprehensive legislation to deal with conflict of interest would be desirable rather than trying to deal with semi-State companies individually in separate Bills.</P>

      <P>This issue arose during the debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997 and on this Bill.  We sought the Attorney General's advice and his opinion was that we should not go down the road suggested by the Deputy because one should know the law.  I appreciate the Deputy did not table the amendment from that point of view, but it creates a loophole with which I do not feel comfortable.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Stagg's fear. However, semi-State company directors have a serious responsibility which is often not acknowledged and they receive token money in many instances.  They do this work out of generosity and a desire to serve the public.  There is a responsibility on people who accept those positions to ensure business is transacted carefully and fully.  There could be a problem with a person who does not take an interest in this.  In such cases, a judge using common sense would go along with the initial position when dealing with a person who fails to comply with this provision. To insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is gilding the lily and it is unnecessary.  A person who has a responsible position as director of a semi-State body should know his business and ensure he is fully informed before he makes decisions.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to protect the person who releases information under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, even if the company has not authorised him to do so.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 contains a definition of &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; which was taken from the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  It seeks to insert a much tighter definition of what should be regarded as confidential information.  The definition in the Bill was drafted prior to the Freedom of Information Act as it allows any information to be specified.  I know from my short and sweet experience as a Minister of State that officials would almost declare the content of the tea in the morning secret in some circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy conjures up woeful pictures of the Secretary General and I in cahoots deciding what is secret.  That is not the position and I do not know what happened previously. I accept amendment No. 14, which is sensible and precise.  With regard to Amendment No. 15, semi-State companies are not photocopies of each other and it is up to each company to decide what it deems to be confidential information. This amendment would be unduly prescriptive. Of course, in time all semi-State companies will be rolled out to freedom of information.  Confidentiality in commercial or related matters is always something for which they should have regard.  The definition of &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo; is one for each company, which in this instance is Bord na Móna.</P>

It is of importance to many areas because it is closely related to regional development.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the additional £10 million was a matter for the budget but I hope she uses her good offices to ensure it is provided. Employees of the board were given a commitment that £110 million would be provided but only £100 million has been received so far.  Bord na Móna is a progressive company and the ESB has reported considerable profits this year so we can be happy that those who provide electricity and fuel are doing so well.  Bord na Móna is anxious that the extra money is provided, I ask the Minister to ensure that is done in the next budget and to impress the importance of the matter on the Minister for Finance.</P>

The proceedings were extremely interesting from Committee Stage onwards, in that many Opposition amendments were accepted.  Deputy Stagg is correct &mdash; I never believed a Bill was perfect because I was the Minister in charge and it came from the draftsman's office.  What is the point of democracy or debating Bills if one thinks one's Bill is the best possible?  Other people have views with sound legal basis, as the proceedings have shown.  The wishes of the unions and management were reflected in amendments which were moved by both parties, represented by Deputies Stagg, Currie and Enright.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna will have a fine future.  It is in competent hands and addressing a range of complex commercial issues with prudence and diligence.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been passed by Seanad Éireann and does four things.  First, it provides for compensation for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries, including Stock Exchange member firms and banks which provide investment services to customers.  Second, it ensures that investors will be entitled to compensation equivalent to 20,000 ECU &mdash; about £15,500 at present &mdash; or 90 per cent of the amount lost, whichever is the lesser.  Third, it implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  Fourth, it provides for amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, the Insurance Act, 1989, and the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The purpose of regulation is twofold, to protect investors and to promote confidence in the financial system.  There have been a number of cases in recent years where investors have lost money, in some cases substantial amounts, through the default of intermediaries to whom they entrusted their savings.  Let us be clear about one thing: no regulatory system can guarantee that a regulated entity will not fail.  What we can do is put in place a system of regulation which is comparable with the best standards internationally, and this is what we have done in the retail sector with the Stock Exchange and Investment Intermediaries Acts, in particular.  Now it is time to look at the question of compensation for investors who lose money because an investment intermediary is unable to meet its liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation is, of course, desirable but it comes at a cost.  In addition to the cost of compensation itself, there will inevitably be administrative overheads to be paid for and there will also be the cost of verifying investors' claims for compensation.  While an argument can be made that investors should carry the associated risks <Col N="707" /> themselves, the Government takes the view that the stronger argument is that individual investors are not generally well equipped to make an informed assessment of the risk that an investment intermediary will fail.  In addition, people make mistakes.  It can be easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to criticise people for believing promises of higher than normal returns on their investments, but in many cases the motive for believing the promises is not so much greed as a lack of the knowledge needed to appreciate the risks.</P>
    <P>A further point is that the provision of a system of investor compensation should help to reduce the systemic risk that a single failure of an investment firm will trigger a wider loss of confidence in the rest of the financial sector.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the broad principles of investor compensation, we now come to the details of what is needed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We must, in the first instance, implement the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  This is a single market directive, intended to ensure that all investment firms which have the so-called &ldquo;passport&rdquo; to sell their services throughout the European Union will be covered by minimum compensation arrangements.  This means that an investor will be able to entrust money to an investment firm located anywhere within the EU, knowing that compensation arrangements are in place to safeguard the funds involved.</P>
    <P>The minimum we are required to do under the directive is to ensure investor compensation arrangements are in place for the minority of investment firms which are subject to it.  This could broadly be described as the bigger firms, such as stockbrokers, portfolio managers and discretionary investment intermediaries.  These are typically firms which handle or control investor funds and provide services in relation to a broad range of investment products, such as shares, units in collective investment undertakings and certain types of derivative product.  About 100 firms are potentially subject to the directive at present.  The directive, however, does not cover what might loosely be called the retail end of the market.  An example would be an investment intermediary who sells packaged products such as unit trusts and who is not allowed to handle client funds.  I might also add that the directive does not apply to insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The directive, therefore, applies only to a minority of investment firms.  However, the Government has taken the opportunity provided by the directive to put in place a comprehensive system of compensation for the entire investment intermediary sector and, indeed, to extend investor compensation to insurance intermediaries as well.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry continues to attract significant amounts of investment funds, particularly from private investors through single premium life insurance products.  The Government felt it would not be right to introduce wide ranging investor compensation arrangements which ignored the insurance sector, particularly when <Col N="708" /> many intermediaries are involved in both insurance and non-insurance investment business. The Bill also extends the compensation arrangements to any general insurance business, such as car and home insurance, placed with an insurance agent or broker.  The Investor Compensation Bill will, therefore, cover both the life and non-life activities of insurance intermediaries as well as the business of what I might call &ldquo;pure&rdquo; investment intermediaries.  Existing protections for insurance clients under the Insurance Acts, such as the provisions ensuring that a client is covered for insurance where the insurance company has invited renewal of a premium or accepted an order, once the client has paid the premium to the agent or broker, will remain in place.</P>
    <P>Under the investor compensation directive, clients of investment firms are entitled to minimum compensation of the lesser of 20,000 ECU, which is about £15,500 at present, or 90 per cent of the amount lost, where an investment firm is unable to return funds or securities belonging those clients.  The Government has decided this is an appropriate level at which to set the entitlement to investor compensation generally under this legislation.  This provides a reasonable amount of compensation, while at the same time giving some recognition to the <i>caveat emptor</i> principle.</P>
    <P>The directive also allows member states to limit entitlement to compensation to private investors and smaller companies, smaller companies in this context meaning companies which meet two out of the following three criteria: a balance sheet total of less than 2.5 million ECU &mdash; about £2 million &mdash; net turnover below 5 million ECU &mdash; about £4 million &mdash; and fewer than 50 employees. The Government takes the view that this is a reasonable approach, since the purpose of the directive and of this legislation is to protect the small investor, and has decided to limit compensation generally under this legislation to private investors and small companies only.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to how investor compensation arrangements will be established.  The Central Bank will be the supervisory authority for investor compensation.  The bank is already the supervisory authority for stockbrokers, credit institutions and investment business firms.  It is also the proposed supervisory authority for insurance intermediaries under legislation which is being drafted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a company called the Investor Compensation Company, which will oversee compensation arrangements for the majority of investment firms, including insurance intermediaries, with the exception of one group.</P>
    <P>Accountants who provide investment services only as an incidental part of their professional activities as accountants can be regulated by their professional body under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, under the overall supervision of the Central Bank.  Building on this, the <Col N="709" /> Investor Compensation Bill allows the accountancy bodies to run compensation schemes for their members.  The compensation schemes for accountants will have to provide compensation cover to the standard required under the Bill and will have to be approved by the Central Bank. This approach is appropriate because the accountants who will be covered by such schemes will not be fully fledged investment firms.</P>
    <P>The Investor Compensation Company will be established by the Central Bank.  It will be a company limited by guarantee and the members of the company will be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The company will have equal numbers of directors representing the financial services sector and consumer interests.  This is a very important provision which will ensure that consumers, whose interests this Bill seeks to protect, will have a say in the policies of the Investor Compensation Company.  The Minister for Finance will be responsible for the appointment of the directors representing the industry and consumer interests, again with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Governor of the Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the board of the company.</P>
    <P>As I said, the company will oversee investor compensation arrangements generally and will be responsible for paying compensation.  The company will decide whether it should maintain a single compensation fund for all investment firms or whether there should be separate compensation funds for different categories of investment firm. The company will also decide the level of contributions to be paid by investment firms.</P>
    <P>That is the broad outline of how investor compensation will be structured.  I will now turn to the proposals included in the Bill for the payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>Compensation will be payable where a client of an investment firm is unable to obtain the return of money or investment instruments from the investment firm.  The Central Bank will first make a determination that an investment firm is unable to repay money or investment instruments.  The company will then invite applications for compensation from clients of the investment firm and will place advertisements in the newspapers inviting applications.  Claims will, of course, have to be verified.  This will be done by the liquidator, where a liquidator has been appointed by the courts; otherwise, the bank can appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to clients of the firm.</P>
    <P>When an investor's claim has been verified, the company must pay compensation within three months.  This period can be extended to six months where the bank agrees.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-life insurance, compensation will, within the limits provided for in the Bill, cover the premium paid or the loss suffered by an <Col N="710" /> investor where a claim under an insurance policy arises.</P>
    <P>Investor compensation will be met by the Investor Compensation Company in the first instance from the contributions paid by investment firms.  I emphasise that the Exchequer will not be involved in funding investor compensation.  In the case of compensation claims involving restricted activity investment product intermediaries and insurance intermediaries, the product producers involved will be responsible for some of the funding. &ldquo;Product producers&rdquo; here means banks, building societies, collective investment undertakings, insurance companies, etc., who are required by law to give intermediaries written appointments to sell their products.  Each product producer will be required to reimburse the company for compensation payable to clients of its intermediaries where the intermediary has taken money for transmission to the product producer and this can be established.</P>
    <P>That is the broad outline of what is proposed in relation to investor compensation.  There are, of course, other provisions in the Act designed to flesh out the detail, to transpose specific requirements of the Investor Compensation Directive and so on.  I might mention in particular the provisions in the Act relating to solicitors.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are exempt from regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, if they provide only investment services which are incidental to their professional activities.  The Law Society compensation fund covers clients of a solicitor in respect of legal services, including financial services.  However, there was a doubt whether the society's compensation fund would cover financial services which did not arise from the provision of legal services.  Accordingly, the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, is being amended to make it clear that the Law Society compensation fund will provide cover for investment and insurance services provided by solicitors where the solicitor is not covered for such services by compensation arrangements under the Investor Compensation Bill.  In other words, the Law Society fund will provide cover for a solicitor who is not contributing to a fund maintained by the Investor Compensation Company.  These provisions can be found in sections 44 to 47 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2(5) of the Bill contains a provision exempting certain investment business firms in the International Financial Services Centre from the obligation to participate in investor compensation. The exemption will apply only to entities which are not subject to the Investor Compensation Directive and which do not provide investment services to domestic investors.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing a substantial number of amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Deputies will recall that the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy compiled a report on the regulation of investment intermediaries following the collapse of the <Col N="711" /> Taylor group of investment companies in August 1996.  The committee's report recommended a number of amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act and many of those recommendations form the basis for the amendments which I propose today.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that I do not propose to comment on each and every section, but rather to highlight for Deputies the main features of the Bill and the purpose underlying certain provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five parts.  The first part deals with general matters.  Part II establishes the Investor Compensation Company Limited, which will have an important role in investor compensation, as I have already outlined, and provides that the accountancy bodies will be able to establish their own compensation arrangements.  Part III deals with the payment of compensation to clients of investment firms.  Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions, including the right of investors to information about compensation and technical sections arising from the terms of the Investor Compensation Directive, as well as provisions relating to solicitors.  Part V contains amendments to the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995 and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the commencement of the provisions of the Act.  The Minister for Finance will commence the provisions of the Act by regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.  As I mentioned earlier, the Bill covers the activities of investment business firms, stock exchange member firms, credit institutions and insurance intermediaries.  These are collectively referred to as investment firms.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the repeal of certain provisions of the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, because they will be redundant when this legislation is in place.  The sections being repealed include the bonding provisions in section 47 of the Insurance Act, 1989 and section 51 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, as well as section 28(4), of the Investment Intermediaries Act.  These sections represent a patchwork of investor protection measures which will be replaced by the unified system of investor compensation proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 designates the bank as the supervisory authority for investor compensation schemes and as the competent authority for the purposes of the EU Investor Compensation Directive.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the administration of investor compensation arrangements, the establishment of the Investor Compensation Company Limited and the approval of compensation schemes for certified persons, which in practice means accountants who provide investment services only as an incidental part of their professional activities.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 20 provide for the establishment <Col N="712" /> by the bank of the Investor Compensation Company Limited.  The company will establish funds out of which clients of investment firms will be paid compensation under this legislation and will set out the amount of the contributions to be paid by investment firms to those funds.  I have already dealt with how the company will be organised so I do not need to go into the details again.</P>
    <P>Section 21 requires investment firms to make contributions to the compensation funds maintained by the company.  An investment firm which does not pay its contribution in full on time will be subject to interest payments on the amount not paid.  If the firm continues to ignore its obligations, it will lose its authorisation to do investment business or, in the case of an insurance intermediary, the insurance companies will be prohibited from doing business with the intermediary. The relevant provisions can be found further on in this Part, in sections 27 and 28.</P>
    <P>Section 21 also provides that the company may, when setting the rates of contribution, take account of investment business done by investment firms before the legislation was commenced, in cases where the investment firm is subject to the Investor Compensation Directive. The reason for this provision is that compensation under the terms of the directive will be retrospective, in the sense that it will cover money and investment instruments given to the investment firm before the commencement of this Act.  A retrospective provision such as this would not normally be acceptable in Irish law; however, our legal advice is that the directive is retrospective in this way.  We are providing, accordingly, for the payment of compensation on a retrospective basis to the extent that this is required by the directive, in Part III of the Act. The section also allows the bank to impose conditions and requirements on investment firms.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the maintenance of funds by the company.  The section specifies that the company will decide the contributions to be paid by investment firms and on the amount of the reserves to be maintained in a fund.  The company must consult the bank before deciding the contributions to be paid, since the bank will be the supervisory authority and will have first-hand knowledge of the sector.  It is proposed that funding of investor compensation will be prospective, in other words, that the company will build up reserves in order to meet claims for compensation, rather than collect contributions to pay claims as they arise.  The company will be required to ensure that it is in a position to pay reasonably foreseeable claims for compensation and must take account of the funding capacity of investment firms when deciding the level of contributions and reserves.</P>
    <P>Section 24 requires the company to have procedures in place to investigate complaints against it.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the approval by the bank of investor compensation schemes for certified <Col N="713" /> persons under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 26 allows the bank to apply to the High Court to revoke the approval of a compensation scheme for certified persons.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the issue of directions by the bank to investment firms which do not comply with their obligations under the Act. Those obligations would mainly relate to contributions, but could also include providing information needed to work out what contribution to compensation the firm should be paying.  The bank is empowered to impose restrictions on the investment services provided by an investment firm which does not comply with those obligations.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Act contains supplementary provisions in relation to a direction by the bank under this section and provides for appeals to the High Court against a direction.</P>
    <P>Section 28 allows the bank to apply to the High Court, following consultation with the company, to have a direction given by it to an investment firm under section 27 confirmed.</P>
    <P>If an investment firm continues to fail to comply with its obligations under the Act, the bank can move to revoke the authorisation of the investment firm to provide investment services or, in the case of an insurance intermediary, ensure that the intermediary is unable to act as an insurance intermediary on behalf of insurance companies.  It will be an offence for a product producer to do business with an investment firm while a product producer has been informed that the firm has not complied with its obligations under this Act.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the payment of compensation to clients of investment and insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Compensation will be payable in defined circumstances. There are two possible triggers: one is a court ruling which effectively prevents investors from recovering their funds from an intermediary for the time being.  An example would be where the courts appoint a liquidator to an investment firm.  The second trigger is where the Central Bank forms the view that an intermediary is unable to return client funds or investment instruments.  In that case, the bank will make a determination that a firm is unable to meet its obligation.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that where the bank has made a determination or a court has made a ruling, the company or compensation scheme must inform clients of the investment firm that they have a right to apply for compensation.  Clients must be given at least five months within which to apply for compensation.  However, this period may be extended in individual cases where the bank believes the client was unable, for good reason, to lodge a claim within the time allowed.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with establishing investors' entitlement to compensation.  Obviously, each claim for compensation will have to be clearly established: the mere existence of a receipt showing <Col N="714" /> that a client entrusted funds to an intermediary does not show, for example, that the money was not subsequently returned.  If a liquidator has been appointed to an investment firm by the courts, the liquidator will be required to establish what is owed to investors by the firm as a priority. If a liquidator has not been appointed, the bank will appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to investors claiming compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is a key section in the Bill.  It provides for the actual payment of compensation to the client once the claim has been established. The compensation will be paid by the investor compensation company or, in the case of a certified person, which in practice means an accountant, by the compensation scheme of which the accountant was a member.</P>
    <P>Section 35 covers the details of compensation payments.  Compensation must be paid as soon as practical and at the latest within three months of the date when the amount lost by a client was established.  This period may be extended for a further period, not greater than three months, with the agreement of the bank.  The compensation scheme will be subrogated to the client of an investment firm in respect of the debt owed by the investment firm to the client and in respect of any payments from a bond or professional indemnity insurance held by the investment firm. This means that if there is still money in the investment firm after a client has been compensated by the investor compensation company or compensation scheme, the client will not be entitled to any of that money until the company or compensation scheme has recovered what it paid out in compensation.  In a sense, compensation can be seen as a down payment on the money owed by the investment firm to the client.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions relating to investor compensation, including technical provisions arising from the investor compensation directive.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides that the bank may require investment firms to hold professional indemnity insurance in respect of investment services they provide.  This will provide additional investor protection where, for instance, an investment firm loses client money through negligence.</P>
    <P>Section 42 provides for the exemption from liability in damages for the bank, its employees, officers and authorised officers, and the company, the board of the company and its officers and employees in carrying out their functions under this Act, unless it is shown that an error or omission was in bad faith, and for a disclaimer of warranty in respect of compensation funds and schemes and investment firms arising from their supervision by the bank.  The State, the company or the bank will not be liable arising out of the insolvency or default of performance of a compensation fund or compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 43 sets out the penalties for offences created under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be a fine of £1 million and, in the case of an individual, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both, <Col N="715" /> on conviction on indictment.  On summary conviction, a maximum fine of £1,500 may be imposed and an individual may be sentenced to prison for up to one year.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 to 47 deal with the provision of investment and insurance services by solicitors, an aspect of the Bill with which I have dealt already.</P>
    <P>Part V contains a number of amendments to the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  Again, I do not propose to go into every section in detail.  Deputies will find all the sections dealt with in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the draft Bill.  Instead I will attempt to draw attention to the thinking behind some of the more significant amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 51 inserts a number of amendments in section 2(1) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Section 2(1) is the definitions section of the Intermediaries Act.  The definitions of &ldquo;investment advice&rdquo;, &ldquo;investment business firm&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; are being amended in the light of experience gained in the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 54 amends section 14 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to provide that the supervisory authority may impose conditions and requirements on investment business firms which are deemed to be authorised under section 26 of the Act as well as in respect of investment business firms which are authorised under section 10 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 58 amends provisions in section 26 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, relating to restricted activity investment product intermediaries. It might be helpful if I recall what is meant by that term.  Restricted intermediaries may only sell products such as unit trusts.  They must not handle client funds, the only exception being where they have a written appointment as a deposit agent.  Restricted intermediaries are deemed to be authorised on the basis of holding at least one written appointment from a product producer, in other words, they do not need to be formally authorised by the Central Bank.  As a result of this amendment, any person who wishes to start up as a restricted activity investment product intermediary in future will have to be fully authorised by the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 59 inserts a new subsection in section 28 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Product producers are required to give a written appointment to any investment business firm through which they sell their products and are required to ensure that the investment business firm complies with the Act.  This element of industry self-regulation is central to the supervisory regime for restricted intermediaries under Part IV of the Act.  The new subsection reinforces this provision by making it an offence for a product producer to deal with an investment business firm without giving an appointment in writing to the firm and without checking that the investment <Col N="716" /> business firm meets the authorisation requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 60 amends section 31 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, by the insertion of a new subsection which provides that a product producer who withdraws an appointment in writing from an investment product intermediary must publish notice of the withdrawal of the appointment in writing in one or more newspapers circulating in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 63 amends section 52 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Section 52 is designed to protect client funds which are in the hands of an investment business firm when a liquidator is appointed to the firm.  The client funds must be kept in separate accounts and the liquidator will not be entitled to use those funds to pay off creditors of the firm.  However, there may be cases where it is justifiable to use client funds to meet a liquidator's costs because the clients will derive benefit from the actions of the liquidator.  It is now proposed to allow such client funds to be used to meet the costs of a liquidator of an investment business firm where the liquidator carries out functions under the Investment Intermediaries Act or under the Investor Compensation Act or distributes the client money and investment instruments, where the firm has no assets from which those costs can be paid.  The High Court will have to approve any such use of client funds.</P>
    <P>Sections 69 to 81 amend various sections of the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  The Investment Intermediaries Act and the Stock Exchange Act contain virtually identical provisions for authorisation and supervision of stock exchange member firms and investment business firms.  Accordingly, I am proposing these amendments to the Stock Exchange Act for the sake of consistency between the two pieces of legislation.  I do not propose to bring the House through the Stock Exchange Act amendments individually.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the text of the investor compensation directive is included as the Third Schedule to the Act.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will never be called upon to do what it provides for, that is, to pay compensation to clients of a failed investment or insurance intermediary.  Realistically, that is a forlorn hope.  Human nature will always be there and so we are unlikely to achieve the perfect world.  The least we can do is try to minimise the number of defaults and ensure that, where they occur, there is some alleviation of the hurt and misery that can result from them.</P>
    <P>The provision of compensation to investors where an investment firm fails to meet its liabilities to its clients is another important step in putting in place a regulatory system for financial intermediaries and an essential element in protecting investors.  The presence of investor compensation arrangements will play an important role in promoting confidence in the investment <Col N="717" /> intermediary sector.  This will in turn benefit the financial sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives an important role in the operation of investor compensation to the investment services industry and to investors.  I am confident they will discharge that role efficiently and well.</P>
    <P>We have consulted widely in the preparation of the Bill with the financial services industry and consumer interests and I would like to thank all those who contributed to the development of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was introduced in the Seanad where Fine Gael welcomed it and I welcome it here.  This is a minor measure.  What the Minister is doing in the interests of the consumer is not very dramatic, but he is moving to fulfil the obligations of the EU investment compensation directive and is going somewhat beyond that in the manner in which he has cast the legislation. This is a small step forward, but we should not make too much of it.  If it has a fault, as is the saying in the first constitutional language, &ldquo;sé a lutch a laghad&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is implementing the EU directive by providing a compensation measure for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries, including Stock Exchange members, firms and banks which provide investment services to customers. He is taking it beyond the terms of the directive and applying it in general terms to the retail side of investment, including insurance companies.  He is also taking the opportunity to load on other amendments in respect of other legislation to which he referred.</P>
      <P>The proposed measure is minor, and that is my main argument with the Bill.  While the Minister has extended the scope of the directive beyond what is required under EU law, he has not extended the terms of the compensation beyond what is required under EU law.  The amount of compensation, 20,000 ecus, about £15,500, is very small.  The intention of the Bill is to protect the small investor.  People who put their savings into investment rather than into the post office or the bank will face a greater risk.  It is difficult to say who the small investor is.  I ask the Minister to increase substantially the amount of compensation payable under the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we think in terms of the average public servant's lump sum on retirement, amounting to about £40,000 or £50,000, that is the nest egg that will be at risk.  For the Minister to go to the trouble to guarantee such small amounts of money, relatively speaking, is a wasted effort.  The Bill is dressed up very well and is very wide in its scope.  It brings us fully into line with our obligations under EU law, but at the end of the day if an investment firm goes down the maximum an investor will get is £15,500 or 90 per cent of the amount lost, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister subtracts from this again by saying that we must envisage this as a down payment. <Col N="718" /> If a liquidator or an administrator finds in winding up the affairs of a company that a residual amount is available for disbursement to persons who have been caught by the collapse of the investment company, as I understand the Minister's explanation, that amount will not apply to those who already received compensation.  It will be returned in the first instance to the company the Minister is setting up under this Bill to provide compensation.  The company rather than the investor will be compensated.  The maximum anybody will get, regardless of their loss, will be £15,500.  If residual amounts are available to a liquidator or an administrator on winding up a company, that money goes back into the main company to replenish the store of compensation available for further eventualities.</P>
    <P>Such a well constructed vehicle is ill-served by the very limited load it carries.  The Minister constructed a great vehicle, enacting EU directives, setting up a company to provide compensation, giving the Central Bank a supervisory role and responsibility for appointing the chairman and vice chairman of the company and giving the Minister for Finance power to appoint other directors of the company, including consumer representatives, but for what purpose?  The day there is another financial scandal, a person will be protected to the extent of the first £15,500 of the money lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>About 80 per cent of small investors would be entitled to less than that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can trick around with statistics, but in the real world investment firms have gone down &mdash; it happened recently in my city. One might question why people are in some of these investment companies in the first instance, and it is difficult to get the full facts.  In the case of the company in Limerick, the sums in the local anecdotal exchange in Limerick city and county were significantly in excess of this amount.  The Minister referred to the Tony Taylor case where the sums were significantly in excess of this amount.  In the case of Finbarr Ross, who is the subject of extradition proceedings in the United States and of a book, copies of which were forwarded to all of us in recent years, the sums of money were significantly in excess of this amount.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that, when the Bill is so well constructed and meets the needs identified, in terms of monetary compensation the need being met is relatively small.  While it will provide a safety net for the small saver, it will do very little for people who are seriously hit by the collapse of an investment company.  I will take up this matter on Committee Stage because the amount of compensation provided is far too small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say the country is not made of money and the taxpayer cannot afford to compensate people who did not apply the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> and who in prudence invested in dicky investment companies, but that would be to miss the point because it is not a charge on the <Col N="719" /> taxpayer.  The charges will be applied across the board to stockbrokers, investment companies and intermediaries who interface between the markets and the customer and provide financial investment services.  It is not sufficient to say that Revenue and the Exchequer cannot afford a greater amount and that it would be a burden on the taxpayer.  They are the standard answers one gets from the Minister for Finance.  On this occasion the Minister is asking intermediaries to fund the investment company.  I cannot see why, therefore, he is so reluctant to peg the amount at such a low level and why he cannot increase it.  I ask him to consider this matter between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provision that either a lump sum or a percentage, whichever is the lesser, should be provided.  This will mean investors will be entitled to 90 per cent of the amount invested or £15,500, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the principle of <i>caveat emptor.</i> In a free market and a democracy, people frequently make choices.  A free market backed up by fully democratic institutions is the best way to run a State and many countries are beginning to realise this.  Countries that are the most prosperous are also the most democratic. Democracy and the free market seem to be two sides of the same coin.  In such circumstances, if people take risks they must do so with their eyes open.</P>
    <P>While I agree with <i>the caveat emptor</i> principle, that is not what underpins this type of legislation. &ldquo;Buyer beware&rdquo; is great advice, but the very small saver, particularly the 80 per cent the Minister of State claims he is targeting under the limits of compensation in this Bill, by definition would not have the information necessary to enable them make free and full choices without risk on the range of financial intermediaries that are listed in the legislation.  The Minister of State claimed the arguments under the <i>caveat emptor</i> principle are not conclusive and he is proceeding along the lines of compensation.</P>
    <P>There must be a limit on the compensation provided, not for <i>caveat emptor</i> reasons, but to ensure investors are prudent with their money. There are many types of schemes through which people can get extravagant interest rates.  If 100 per cent compensation were available up to any limit, investors could put their money anywhere because they would be guaranteed to get it back. The <i>caveat emptor</i> principle does not, therefore, underpin the limits of compensation in the legislation. In a society such as this we must encourage people to act prudently in their personal and financial affairs, and particularly in their investment affairs.  I have no difficulty with that principle.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the structure proposed in the Bill.  It is important that the Central Bank should act as the supervisor.  It is also important that the chairperson and vice-chairperson will be appointed by the Central Bank.  However, this runs counter to the view expressed by the Governor <Col N="720" /> of the Central Bank before a committee of the Oireachtas when he stated that the role of the Central Bank in consumer affairs is strictly prudential, that the solvency of the institution is its primary concern and that it protects the consumer by ensuring prudential control and supervision. In other words, the main protection provided by the Central Bank is an assurance that the institution will not go bust and investors' money is safe.  He did not seem to believe it had a role beyond that in terms of protecting the consumer.</P>
    <P>What level of consultation took place since to enable the Central Bank take a direct role in a compensation scheme for consumers?  It will not only be the supervisor of the investment fund company, but the Governor may appoint the leading people.  That is a total change of emphasis on the position he adopted several weeks ago before a committee of this House.  At that time he seemed to think the concerns of consumers were vested in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that the Director of Consumer Affairs, as an independent office holder, would effectively look after the interests of the consumer and the vehicle for transmitting new powers to him would be through the Tánaiste's Department.  The Minister of State said the Central Bank will appoint the two leading people in the company and the Minister for Finance will appoint the other directors of the company, and not only those with the financial expertise but those representing consumer interests.  Again, that is a change from what we were led to believe a few weeks' ago.  The Director of Consumer Affairs or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would be the appropriate person or persons to appoint directors specifically gauged to protect consumers' interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what will happen.  That is why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be consulted.  She will be involved with the Minister for Finance for that reason</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>How will that happen when the Bill states the Minister for Finance will appoint them?  One can consult with anybody.  We all know the procedures of Cabinet.  When a board is being appointed everybody is consulted and, particularly in a coalition arrangement, consultations will take place.  While a provision for consultation is included in the Bill, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should at least appoint the people who will represent consumers' interests.  Alternatively, Mr. Fagan's office could be given the role.  Rather than challenging the manner in which the Minister of State is making the arrangement under the Bill, I am exploring the attitude or philosophy behind it. This seems to be totally different from what the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank stated when they appeared before a committee of this <Col N="721" /> House.  The Governor, in particular, told us he saw the bank's role as prudential and that while the liquidity of the institutions, their solvency and consumer protection issues were important, they were not central to his remit.  He went on to state that if the Houses of the Oireachtas decided consumer protection had to be beefed up, the primary function should be vested elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State inform the House of the status of the working party set up to examine consumer protection issues arising from the position in National Irish Bank?  That body was set up specifically to deal with such issues, to recommend if extra consumer protection was required and, if so, where the responsibility should be vested.  This reasonably significant legislation appears to have a life independent of the senior personages involved in a committee of this House.  It also has a life independent of the thinking which prompted the Minister for Finance to set up a working party to examine these issues. Will the Minister of State respond to those matters later?</P>
      <P>The Bill exempts solicitors and accountants from the provisions of the compensation investor fund on two grounds.  The Minister of State claims the investment of their clients' funds is incidental to their primary business as professionals and because they are, in effect, self-regulating professional bodies with their own compensation schemes, those schemes should be liable for loss suffered by investment arising from malpractice or the crash of any investment portfolio put together by a solicitor or an accountant. I am not sure that is the best way to proceed.  For too long we have exempted the higher professions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may correct me if I misunderstand the position.  Persons who go the route of the compensation scheme operated by the Law Society will not have their compensation within the timeframe laid down which states that once the claim is verified payment should be made within three months.  The Law Society does not act that way or with such rapidity.  A serious disadvantage may be incurred by persons who have lost their money due to the inadequacies of one of the higher professions, such as solicitors and accountants, as against a person who has lost money due to the inadequacies of the financial intermediaries which are the primary focus of the Bill.  I want the Minister to justify the quasi exemptions of solicitors and accountants from the main provisions of the Bill.  I understand and agree that the primary professional role of a solicitor and accountant is not investment.  However, if they are involved in putting investment schemes together for clients without using an alternative financial intermediary, I do not understand why a separate regime should apply to them and why they should not be required to participate in contributing to the company which will compensate investors and from which their clients could subsequently benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my party will not <Col N="722" /> oppose it on Second Stage.  There is an interesting philosophy underpinning it which seems to be at variance with what has been said by the various people I have mentioned over the past two months.  The actual amounts are relatively small. The Minister may be able to statistically prove to the House that 80 per cent of investment is less than £15,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from my normal constituency work and from contact with people that this level of compensation is quite small.  Some people have a couple of hundred pounds here and there and it does not matter if they lose it.  However, such a loss would be significant for people who have invested their life savings or a lump sum payment from their pension.  Some £15,000 compensation or 90 per cent, whichever is the lesser, is inadequate.  The Minister should reconsider this, particularly in circumstances where it is a self-funding apparatus.</P>
      <P>The company will operate on the basis of collecting contributions in normal times when no investment company has gone down the tubes and will not wait until the crisis occurs before it collects the funds.  In other words, it will have an annual contribution on a weighted basis which will apply to different companies.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how the weighting will occur.  Will it be weighted on the size of the company, in terms of the gross turnover of the particular stockbroking firm or on the basis of the number of clients a firm might have?  If there is a crash in an area of investment in which a company is not involved, will the same liability apply to the financial intermediaries who are in a particular line of investment as to those who are in different lines of investment?  Will difficulties in an insurance product, for example, apply equally to companies which are not involved in insurance?</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement is inadequate in giving us an insight to how the fund will be aggregated and weighted and the type of money we are talking about.  Is the Minister trying to put together a fund of £1 million or £100 million a year?  He has given us no insight to what pool of money will be available at any particular time. When we examine the details of the legislation on Committee Stage, I presume all the normal provisions which would allow the company to borrow and so on are in place.  I would like a reasonable amount of time to discuss and thoroughly examine this lengthy legislation on Committee Stage.  I do not know if it is the Minister's intention to send this Bill to the select committee or to take Committee Stage in the House. Perhaps he could clarify that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I express a firm preference that we should deal with this Bill in the select committee rather than in the House as there is little time left before the recess and this is a sufficiently <Col N="723" /> important and detailed Bill to require such treatment.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate as it is timely in many ways, not least because it comes at a time when the regulation of the entire financial services sector is under intense scrutiny.  The Bill introduces a new system for investor compensation but it also seeks to amend the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, in a way which I assume is intended to make it more effective.  There are two broad areas, therefore, we should address.  We must look at the principle &mdash; Deputy Noonan called it the philosophy &mdash; and the practice of investor compensation, the way we regulate financial services generally and the way those services are provided to the public.  I support the broad principle behind this Bill but I will not scream its merits from the rooftops.</P>
      <P>I believe in enterprise and risk taking.  Our society's record in these matters is probably less than persuasive.  I readily accept this is changing but in the past we have not always been a risk taking people.  We have been, for understandable and good reasons, greatly given to the easy bet, the short-term option.  Any person in the 1970s who received money would most likely have done one of two or three things.  They would have invested it in property, usually domestic houses, in blue chip shares in the financial institutions we are discussing today, or in deposit accounts in banks, building societies or the post office.  They were carefully saving for the rainy day with little or no risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be regulated by what we are doing here today.</P>
      <P>Such safe investments served people well but they did little to contribute to the type of enterprise and risk taking which this country badly needs.  The role of the blue chip investment is diminishing, the property market is overheated, the potential for profit is diminishing and the Government decided recently to eliminate some of the unnecessary tax incentives which are pushing up prices.</P>
      <P>The Stock Exchange is also showing early signs of overheating.  It seems clear that many people are investing in equities with a view to realising a capital gain from the disposal of those shares rather than to earn moneys by way of dividend as they hold the shares.  This will not cause us problems immediately but we must keep an eye on it for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of interest which can be obtained from depositing moneys in a bank, building society or other financial institution is now so low that many people are looking for other options for investment purposes.  The number of people willing to invest in unit trusts, insurance products and other financial instruments has increased substantially over the years and it is likely that this will continue. <Col N="724" /> The willingness to explore other possibilities has led to a greater availability of financial products and a mushrooming in the number of people and firms seeking to advise people to invest in these products.  Most investment intermediaries are not specifically interested in selling advice but in selling products, particularly those produced by a particular bank, insurance company or other institutions.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this Bill is in Part III, particularly in sections 30 to 34 which set out the circumstances in which compensation will be paid.  I have read these sections carefully but I am still unclear as to their scope and intent.  To that extent I am unclear as to the scope and intention of the Bill.  It seems clear that the Bill is primarily intended to cope with circumstances where an investment company or an intermediary goes bankrupt or insolvent, leaving some of its clients out of pocket.  This is most likely to happen in circumstances where moneys are misused or misapplied either fraudulently or otherwise.  I am assuming this because the Bill as formulated does not state it clearly.  This test applied by the Bill seems very simple.  As I read it, the Bill simply requires that moneys should be owed to a client in connection with the provision of investment business services by an investment firm.  If that debt is established the entitlement to compensation applies.  If I give £10,000 to a broker or some other intermediary or firm and he pockets it, clearly I am entitled to compensation in the event that it cannot be returned.</P>
    <P>Let me put a few other scenarios to the Minister and perhaps he can tell me whether a compensation entitlement would arise.  If I go to an adviser, broker, accountant or investment firm with £20,000 or £30,000, I am told I will be looked after, that the individual concerned with whom I am dealing has come across some wonderful investment possibilities which offer the prospect of a decent profit into the future.  He then goes off and invests in good faith &mdash; I stress in good faith &mdash; in a newly floated company or unit trust which does not work out.  There is no specific agreement or contract between the intermediary, the adviser, the broker and the client &mdash; me for the sake of argument &mdash; as to what should be done with the money.  Nonetheless the money has been lost.  In effect the client trusts the broker who makes a bad decision.  In those circumstances does the client have an entitlement to compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the example I have given the broker is acting in good faith.  What is the position if the broker is acting recklessly and an investment does not work out?  What happens if he acts negligently by investing the client's money without checking out the investment properly in the first instance?  The point I am getting at is simply this: if I go into an investment company with £20,000 or £30,000, that money can go missing or <Col N="725" /> be lost in many different ways.  It can be lost by virtue of fraud on the part of the intermediary, recklessness, negligence, carelessness and a host of other different ways.  Investors need to know in exactly what circumstances entitlement to compensation will arise.  Surely it is not intended to compensate investors if they knowingly and consciously take a risk that goes wrong.  Equally I assume it is intended to compensate investors where they are defrauded of money.  There is a huge grey area in between which we need to address.  Is it intended, for example, to provide compensation automatically if a court order is obtained against a particular business investment company?</P>
      <P>The rationale behind the Bill relies on one central factor, namely, the inequality of the relationship between the investment company and the client.  If I go into an investment company, I am entitled to assume that the person with whom I am dealing knows a great deal more about financial products than I do.  In that sense it is or can be an unequal relationship.  In fact, in many cases, the client will know little or nothing about the product in which they ultimately invest.  This inequality of the relationship is the central factor in determining whether compensation should be paid.  If the relationship is hugely unequal, for example the little old lady investing her life savings, then it is surely right that compensation should be available in the event of her trust being misplaced.  In those circumstances I agree with Deputy Noonan that the limit of 20,000 ecus is far too low.  On the other hand if a company employing ten, 20 or 30 people loses money in similar circumstances, it is difficult to see why they should be entitled to compensation.  In that sense the definition of &ldquo;eligible investor&rdquo; seems to be over generous, in that it allows companies, which should be well able to look after themselves and to assess their agents, to claim compensation.</P>
      <P>The role of product producers &mdash; banks, for the sake of argument &mdash; is obviously important.  As I understand it, more than 80 per cent of investment business and intermediaries are tied to particular product producers.  It is obviously right that these product producers should be obliged or encouraged to ensure that the people and companies acting on their behalf and selling their products are fit and proper people.  It is also right in principle that these banks, product producers, should take the hit in the event that the agent does not match up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill specifically seeks to eliminate the existing bonding system which governs insurance companies.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, debated this matter at some length in the Seanad.  While I have read the records of the Seanad debates, I still have a difficulty here.  The central argument appeared to be that bonding was ineffective, that it did not provide a sufficient level of compensation and that in any event a good deal of the money went towards administration costs and so on.  If that is the case, <Col N="726" /> given that this is just one consumer protection provision, does the same argument apply to other measures of bonding which are in place or which we are considering putting in place?  For example, the Minister for Education and Science is considering putting in place a bonding system for private colleges.  We have in place a system for stockbrokers and a system for travel agencies. Are those bonding systems subject to the same faults and deficiencies which the Minister of State mentioned during the Seanad debate?  Are we codding ourselves and the public when we talk about bonding as being an adequate means of protection?  I suppose the Minister has raised this particular issue and perhaps we need to explore it.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a consumer protection element in this Bill.  In fact this is by far the most important element in it and the Minister seeks to deal with it, in part at least, by having the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, appoint some of the board.  There is still a difficulty here in so far as the company as set up under the Bill, is effectively a legal entity whose sole purpose is to rubber-stamp the decisions of the Central Bank.  In order to discharge the two or three functions which it specifically has, it is required to consult with the Central Bank but it will not, as I understand it, have access to the information available to the Central Bank in the discharge of the Central Bank's supervisory role.  In other words, if the Central Bank becomes aware of deficiencies in a particular investment company, during the course of the exercise of its supervisory role, it will not, in the normal course of events, share that information with the compensation company.  If that is the case the compensation company will end up effectively rubberstamping decisions which are, in effect, being taken in Dame Street, presumably in the same building, by the Central Bank itself.</P>
    <P>Many of the later sections in Part V were recommended by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment during the course of the last Dáil.  Perhaps we can deal with those in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment generally about banking regulation and about regulation of financial services. There is clearly a cogent case to be made for bringing the regulation of all financial services into one supervisory body.  There are obvious reasons for doing this.  We can build up a certain measure of expertise, some of which does not exist.  It simplifies matters and ensures a certain consistency in the way in which particular bodies are regulated.  I am not yet convinced that the Central Bank is the way to go.  Clearly, this and the legislation which is envisaged from the Department of Enterprise and Employment is intended to bring all of this into the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Central Bank is the monetary system &mdash; managing the currency, interest rates and so on behalf of the Government. <Col N="727" /> I appreciate it will not be doing that after the end of this year, at least, other than as an agent of the European Central Bank and so its role in that regard will be diminished.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know whether we will simply transfer people out of the primary role, who are managing the currency into the regulatory authorities or whether we will employ people who have a specific expertise in this specific area, namely the one of regulation.  It is important that we have a dedicated body, whose sole purpose is to regulate financial services.  We know from the experience of the 1995 Act that there are many more people in firms doing this business than we imagined.  There is a clear need to build up expertise over a period in a financial supervisory authority, which will allow us to deal consistently and properly with them.</P>
    <P>I refer to the point raised by Deputy Noonan at the end of his contribution: the apparent contradiction which exists here between consumer protection on the one hand and regulation, from the prudential point of view, of the system on the other.  Deputy Noonan and I had the opportunity to discuss in different parts of Europe last week the experience in other countries and how these matters are done.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to pre-empt the decisions of the committee, one thing which I came back with is simply that we need to be clear about the defined and different functions. We need to set aside consumer protection and tax evasion, and deal with the regulation of financial services.  We need to give independent bodies specific functions and the powers to do them with as much exchange of information as can be legally provided for.</P>
    <P>There is much to be teased out on Committee Stage of the Bill but I welcome its thrust.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to bring forward a package of improved financial support for student nurses which will allow them to undertake their courses in nursing in a proper educational context without undue strain, stress and financial hardship and, more particularly, calls on the Government to provide a weekly non-means tested grant of £75 per week to student nurses; free meals for the duration of their three year programme whether in the designated base hospital or whilst undertaking an external clinical placement or academic studies; full payment to meet the expenditure incurred in the new fourth year <Col N="728" /> degree programme and full reimbursement of the cost of any second temporary accommodation required by student nurses when undertaking external clinical placements away from the base hospital; and further calls on the Government to acknowledge that student nurses are not in a position similar to other third level students as they have a 48 week year working commitment at 35 hours each week and are, as a consequence, unable to take up any part-time employment from which they can generate any meaningful income without undermining their study programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I express the view that student nurses have over the years and are currently effectively treated as the Cinderellas of our health system.  It is time for us to move away from the Cinderella syndrome and to acknowledge the value of the work undertaken by student nurses and to recognise and alleviate the hardship and difficulty which many of them suffer during the course of their study years.</P>
      <P>Nurses play a vital and fundamental role in the delivery of health services and the care of patients.  For many years I have been of the view that the role of nursing has been undervalued and under-recognised, and that nurses have not been granted the status recognition to which they are entitled.  That this was articulated by many of whose who made submissions to the Commission on Nursing should come as no surprise.</P>
      <P>It is in the public interest that student nurses are provided with the highest level of education and training possible to enable them to utilise their skills upon qualifying to the maximum benefit for the patients under their care.  It is only in recent years that the need to modernise and revitalise the training and education of student nurses has been addressed.  A revised programme for basic pre-registration nursing education and training was introduced in Galway in 1994, replacing the traditional apprenticeship model. This programme was extended to four schools of nursing in 1995, a further nine additional schools of nursing in 1996 and a further 13 in 1997.  In 1997, 27 schools of nursing offered a pre-registration nursing diploma programme based on the Galway model.  The remaining schools of nursing, of which there are a small number in mental handicap and psychiatry, are completing the transition to the diploma programme in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is of three years' duration and provides for 4,600 hours of theoretical and clinical instruction.  The theory content of the programme, including study time, is of 58 weeks' duration. A total of 86 weeks is allocated to clinical placements, that is nursing practice.  Thus, the programme now in place is not simply an academic programme or simply a programme of <Col N="729" /> practical training.  It is a mix of both which over a three year period requires student nurses to undertake a 35 hour, 48 week working year.</P>
    <P>Over the decades student nurses have played a crucial role in running our hospitals.  Today they continue to play an important role within the health system in the clinical placements in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>Student nurses are unique compared to almost all other third level students.  They undertake a course which is partly academic but which also, over a three year period, involves a substantial practical commitment which greatly benefits the general community.  This commitment renders it virtually impossible for student nurses to generate any substantial, separate and independent income by taking up part-time employment.  To do so can only undermine their study programme and their capacity to undertake their practical duties.</P>
    <P>While, according to the Department of Health and Children, student nurses are no longer officially part of the workforce and are under the new system, to use the bureau-speak in which we engage, &ldquo;supernumerary and paid a grant&rdquo;, the reality is that while undergoing their practical training and placement work, they are more often than not still providing a nursing service from which the general community benefits.  Moreover, the practical training and placement work which is required of nursing students means that they are not integrated fully within the general student body and find themselves perched awkwardly between the education and health sectors. Student nurses have also discovered that the unique and anomalous position in which they find themselves has facilitated an ongoing game of ping-pong between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science with regard to the issue of responsibility for the provision of their education, its funding and their grant income.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing in its interim report has described the current education system applicable to nursing students and documented numerous concerns and criticisms about the current system which it is expected will be addressed by it in its final report when published in July.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the commission will recommend radical changes to the current system.  It can be reasonably anticipated that the Commission on Nursing will seek to separate the academic from the practical and provide for an educational system for student nurses which has in its separate components an academic portion and a practical portion.  It can be anticipated that in the context of the academic side, student nurses will be fully integrated within the thirdlevel education system, while I hope that in the context of the practical, they will be recognised as not only undergoing a learning and training process but also, while doing so, making a valuable contribution to the health service.  This is a contribution which should be properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> The recommendations of the commission with regard to education are unlikely to be implemented in full until at least the year 2001 or 2002.  Accordingly, it is vital that difficulties with the current structure of education as it affects nursing students, and the inequalities apparent within it, are addressed in the interests of current nursing students and those who will turn to nursing as a career during the next two to three years.</P>
    <P>In 1998, approximately 900 nursing students are undertaking the nursing diploma programme. Over the last few months student nurses have been involved in a public protest.  They should never have been put in a position where they felt it necessary to engage in such protest.  Their protest is understandable.  They are rightly critical of the inadequate provision made for them by the State while undertaking their diploma course.  In response, with effect from 1 March 1998, the Minister for Health and Children increased the annual maintenance grants from the sum of £2,500 per annum to £3,000 per annum.  On a weekly basis, the maintenance grant is worth £57.69 per week.  An external clinical placement allowance of £20 per week is also paid to a student undertaking an external clinical placement for the duration of that placement in any case where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation away from her or his normal place of residence and where the health board, hospital or other agency in which the placement is being undertaken is not in a position to provide such accommodation.  A student undertaking an external placement who does not require accommodation different from their usual residence is provided with a free bus pass.  A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 is also provided for each student commencing the diploma programme.  While they are entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions, the reality for many students is that in the context of their academic studies or their practical placements free meals are not available.</P>
    <P>The reality for many student nurses is that they are obliged to rely on hand-outs and parental financial assistance and are forced to obtain temporary work during unsocial hours and at weekends, from which they receive limited remuneration. Having regard to their work commitments and practical placements, it is highly undesirable that nursing students be placed in such a position. Official recognition has not yet been given to the fact that in the context of the manner in which the diploma course is currently run, nursing students are not like other third level students.  It is not only in their interest but in the public's interest that they should be treated differently.</P>
    <P>In reply to a succession of parliamentary questions, the Minister for Health and Children suggested that the total value of supports currently provided for nursing students amounts to approximately £6,000 per annum and that this &ldquo;compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students&rdquo;. <Col N="731" /> This does not properly reflect the position and is grossly misleading.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children seeks some kudos for the fact that student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf and he stated in reply to various parliamentary questions that the average annual fee is £1,300 per annum.  The reality is that third level fees for many thousands of other students have been abolished in their entirety.  Accordingly, the fee that the relevant health agency is now paying on behalf of nursing students is merely an accounting mechanism.  The health agency is effectively paying this fee while the Department of Education and Science is meeting the fees of other third level students.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to parliamentary questions emphasised that the £3,000 grant paid to nursing students is &ldquo;not subject to a means test&rdquo; and he contrasted this with the grant payable to other students.  The maximum rate of this grant is £1,624 and it is means tested.  However, the Minister is not comparing like with like.  The other students to whom he referred are not required to undertake employment or practical training, a 35 hour week for 48 weeks of the year over a three year period, or work under the aegis of a health agency or any other agency.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of student nurses who, if they undertook third level education in a different area, would qualify for the maximum maintenance grant on a means tested basis.  They would thus, without having to undertake any practical placements or work, be entitled to £1,624 per annum by way of a grant.  How many of the thousands of other students in our third level colleges who are currently in receipt of this grant would undertake a 35 hour working week for receipt of a further sum of £1,400, which equals £26.92 per week?</P>
    <P>Unlike other third level students, student nurses must maintain their own rented accommodation for a full year during each of the three years they are undertaking their training and studies.  Other third level students need only do so for a maximum period of nine months each year.  The additional sum of £20 per week which is made available to student nurses in the event of their having to obtain alternative accommodation while undertaking a clinical placement remote from their own residence is grossly unrealistic.  It does not remotely address the real economic cost of providing alternative accommodation for six to eight week periods during their second and third year studies while continuing to maintain the availability of their original accommodation.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many student nurses are confronted with real financial hardship.  This was clearly illustrated by the fact that 1,000 student nurses recently marched on the Department of Health and Children to call for specific financial improvements to facilitate their undertaking their studies.  In this motion, Fine Gael is asking the Government to give to all student nurses the non-means <Col N="732" /> tested grant of £75 per week they are seeking. As already stated, the current grant amounts to £57.69 per week.  The increase would give student nurses an additional £17 per week in round figures.  The overall effect would be to increase the annual grant from £3,000 per annum to £3,900.  I am calling on the Government to agree to so increase the grant.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, in opposing the motion, the Minister has merely tabled a brief countermotion congratulating himself on the minimal increases he provided on 1 March last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth putting the current grant into a certain perspective.  The current sum of £57.69 payable to student nurses can be contrasted with what each student nurse would presently receive if in receipt of unemployment assistance.  A recipient of short-term unemployment assistance is entitled to £68.40 per week while a recipient of long-term unemployment assistance is entitled to £70.50 per week.  Consequently, we currently pay a larger sum weekly by way of unemployment assistance than we make available to student nurses undertaking practical courses and effectively working for the benefit of the community for 48 weeks in the year.</P>
      <P>The position of solicitors' apprentices, with which I am familiar, can be favourably contrasted with that of student nurses.  When the Minister for Health and Children increased the student nurses' grant on 1 March l998 to £57.69 per week, by coincidence, the Law Society of Ireland issued its revised scale of salaries for solicitors' apprentices, which are also applicable from the same date.  During his or her first six months in a solicitor's office, an apprentice solicitor must be paid £135 per week, for the second six months £145 per week and thereafter the sum of £155 per week.  These salaries are paid to solicitor's apprentices after they have completed a six month academic course in the Law Society. However, even before undertaking the professional course in the Law Society, if a solicitor's apprentice undertakes practical work in the office to which he or she is apprenticed, the solicitors' guidelines recommend that he or she should receive a minimum sum of £105 per week.  As a member of the legal profession, I do not believe it is correct that as a society we attach greater value to work of solicitor's apprentices than we attach to that of student nurses during their study years.</P>

    <P>The demand made by student nurses for a non-means tested grant of £75 per week can be seen to be exactly what it is: extremely modest, when contrasted to payments made to those apprenticed to professional legal practices.  It is even <Col N="733" /> more modest when contrasted to the payments we make in respect of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion before the House not only calls on the Government to increase the grant to £75 per week to student nurses but also calls on it to ensure that the free meals to which they are entitled are made available to them.  The fact that free meals are not being provided where lectures are being undertaken in third level institutions and that the Department of Health and Children has declined to meet the cost of such meals is a clear breach of the original terms surrounding the interim model for nursing education.</P>
    <P>The final issue to which I will refer is of substantial importance, namely, the refusal of the government to abolish the fees for students undertaking the Bachelor of Nursing degree course &mdash; a one year course in UCG &mdash; which will be offered by at least two other universities, commencing in 1999.  I understand that 52 students are currently enrolled in the course at UCG.  In reply to parliamentary questions to the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to provide an exemption from fees for those undertaking this course, the Department of Education and Science essentially washed its hands of the issue stating that nursing education is a matter for the Department of Health and Children.  The Department of Health and Children also washed its hands of the issue by stating that, having previously completed the diploma course, student nurses are entitled to register as nurses and are not compelled to undertake the degree course.</P>
    <P>The fee for the degree course amounts to £1,965.  The course comes under an undergraduate category and the general rule is that students do not incur fees for the first full-time undergraduate course undertaken by them in university.  At least that is the general rule applied by the Department of Education and Science.  Nursing students undertaking the one-year degree course are essentially the only full-time undergraduate students in a State-funded college in the Republic who do not qualify for free fees.  It is entirely unjust and inequitable to single out one group of students, whose additional training and education is profoundly to the benefit of the community and health service, in this way.</P>
    <P>I predict that the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing &mdash; to be published in July &mdash; will ultimately provide for an educational system in which nurses undertaking training in the future will first enter into our third level colleges to obtain appropriate degrees of an undergraduate nature, which will be fully funded by the State.  Why should those nursing students who this year are participating in the degree course in UCG and who during the coming years will undertake such degree courses having completed the diploma course, not be exempted from undergraduate fees as are all undergraduates at present and as also will those who follow them following <Col N="734" /> the implementation of the anticipated recommendations of the nursing commission?</P>
    <P>As medicine becomes more specialised, as medical technology becomes more complex and as greater emphasis is placed on community services there will be an increasing number of jobs for nurses in the coming years.  We are already experiencing a shortage of nursing staff throughout the hospital system.  In 1997 the total intake of student nurses was 1,139 as compared with 1,368 in 1995.  There was a drop in 1997 of almost 200 in the numbers of those who see their future in nursing undertaking studies in this State.  While this year there may have been an increase in the number of students over and above those in 1997, there is a growing crisis in the numbers available for nursing within our health services.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the shortage of nurses and for the reduction in the number of students undertaking nursing as a career.  It must be an objective of our health and education system to encourage young people into nursing. However, the Government's actions are having the opposite effect.  If the House was to reject this motion it would send the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment and invite the Government parties to join with the Fine Gael Party in their support for the motion.  They should provide student nurses with the additional resources they require.  I call on the Independent Deputies, on whose votes the Government is dependent, to back the Fine Gael Party in the vote on the motion in the interests of the well-being of our health service and its student nurses who, in their professional careers, contribute so much of value to all of those who come under their care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak for Members from all sides of the House when I say it is a great source of embarrassment to the Dáil and to politicians who represent constituents on a daily basis that this issue must be debated here.  The sum of money involved is not colossal.  It will not change irreparably the Estimates for a given year.  A small amount is involved and the issue should have been resolved through consultations between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.  It is a matter of embarrassment that a university and student group in Galway had to take an action against the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is support in the country for nurses, especially those entering the fourth and final year of their course, which is the only course at university level to charge tuition fees.  The motion seeks to apply a level playing pitch because it is wrong to discriminate against a relatively small group of people in college.  Unlike other students, who have only 15 hours of lectures per week and a few tutorials and hang about lobbies drinking coffee, student nurses work 35 hours-plus per week and make a valuable contribution to the health services. It is wrong that a bureaucratic mess between the Department of Education and Science <Col N="735" /> and the Department of Health and Children should have been allowed to get to this stage.</P>
    <P>It is critical that the career of nursing be made attractive to young people.  There is ample evidence that insufficient numbers wish to pursue such a career.  By virtue of the fact that the tuition fees row has been centre stage as a result of the UCG case and this motion such a career is less attractive to school leavers.  That is dangerous and damaging for the caring tradition and the support for it in the community.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to rethink its position. The matter can be resolved overnight.  There would be support in the community if the Government lifted its embargo on fourth and final year students and made a concession to nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter for moving the motion.  We have reached the ludicrous situation where health authorities now have to advertise nursing posts in countries as far away as Iceland and Finland.  Matrons are unable to find nursing staff and the position is reaching crisis point in some hospitals.  For example, a hospital in Dublin has 46 nursing vacancies.</P>
      <P>The drop in intake of students from 1,133 in 1989 to fewer than 800 this year, and the increasing cost to students of the new training scheme for nursing staff, is compounding the problem. Student nurses are now in the unfortunately unique position of being the only university students not in receipt of free fees for the duration of their undergraduate degree course.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority have engaged in discussions on this issue since last October, yet no decision on funding has been made.  Both Department are pen-pushing the issue by passing the buck from one Department to the other.  Student nurses are suing the Minister for Education and Science for discrimination as they face fees of up to £2,000 for the final year course in UCG.  Those students, who have just completed a three year diploma course funded by the Department of Health and Children, are caught in an internal power struggle between the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Science. It is time for the two Ministers to stop the petty bickering and provide funding for final year nursing students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost to a student of living away from home is approximately £5,500 per annum, yet even the maintenance grants of £3,000 per annum, generous by comparison with those available to other third level students, cannot cover the overheads facing nursing students.  With increasing costs of rented accommodation fuelled by the Government's recent new housing policy and the suggested 10 per cent rise in CIE fares many student nurses find themselves forced into taking up second and even third jobs doing unsocial hours and at weekends to help make ends meet.  This <Col N="736" /> is untenable when one considers that the nursing course is 35 hours per week, 48 weeks per year.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to provide adequate funding to ensure the survival of student nurses while in college.  He should immediately introduce a weekly non means tested grant of £75 per week as recommended by the INO.  This amounts to something short of £4,000 per annum and is a meagre sum compared with the cost of going to college, which can range from £5,500 to £6,000 per annum.  Even with this grant student nurses would still have to be subsidised by their families. However, it would provide a basic weekly wage for students who are currently providing cheap labour for our health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also provide additional student places to curb the staffing shortfall within many of our hospitals.  Even with the current inadequate level of funding many of our prospective nurses must travel to England to receive their education.  Many of them remain in the British health service on completing their studies.  It is morally wrong to see so many of those young people heading to England when there is a severe shortage of nursing staff here.  It is the Minister's duty to ensure additional places are provided in the current academic year and I urge him to do so.</P>
    <P>In the current economic climate the Minister has the opportunity to meet the demands of the small number of students concerned, a group who are vital to ensuring the provision of a proper health service which meets the needs of communities throughout the country.  I urge the Minister to provide the necessary funding.  It is ludicrous that students in NUI Galway are taking the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science to court to get their basic right to free fees to which every other student in a university is entitled.  It is another argument whether other courses should be provided, but the students concerned will have a university degree on completing their studies and they should be given adequate funds which they deserve.  I urge the Minister to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister to review this matter and to bring forward proposals to deal with it.  Student nurses who have a 48 week academic year and work 35 hours a week are seeking a non-means tested grant of £75 a week. They should be entitled to free meals for the duration of their three year programme, whether based in a hospital or undertaking external clinical placement or academic studies, and full reimbursement of the cost of any temporary accommodation required when undertaking external clinical placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the current rate of inflation, our booming economy, the number of jobs, the difficulty of retaining nurses and the INO's warning about the serious shortage of nurses, we should be encouraging students to train as nurses.  While nursing is a fantastic profession, it is hard work which <Col N="737" /> demands a great deal of skill.  Often student nurses have to rely on getting money from their parents or have to take up jobs outside the hospital.  It would be appreciated if the Minister would consider increasing support.  While there is an intake of only 800 student nurses this year, increased support would make nursing a more attractive career to students.  In this technological age and with the advancement of other careers, nursing is no longer perceived as the be all and end all of jobs, as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>A newspaper article states that it has always been a problem to retain nurses.  Hospitals find nurses who have completed three years' training leave to go to university to complete the fourth year of the degree programme and it is difficult to replace them from within the hospital.  There has been a growth in the number of nursing homes in rural areas and many nurses opt to work in those homes.  That puts constant pressure on hospitals to maintain the level of their nursing staff.</P>
    <P>Often nurses working in private nursing homes complain they are paid less than the minimum wage.  That also presents a problem.  Nurse training involves 156 weeks and demands great dedication and major commitment.  There is less incentive for students to pursue a nursing career when trained nurses are paid such a low wage in the private nursing home sector.  I ask the Minister to consider the wage levels in that sector and I appeal to him to increase the level of support for student nurses.  The State has benefited from an excellent health service and dedicated hospital staff, particularly nurses.  Irish nurses working abroad are instantly recognised as dedicated and well trained.  The allocation to student nurses must be increased if the nursing profession is to be sustained by making it attractive to students.</P>
    <P>The registered nursing diploma programme involves 156 weeks, including 58 weeks of theoretical training.  As outlined in the nursing board's 1994 syllabus there are 29 weeks theoretical training in the first year, 18 weeks in the second year and 11 weeks in the third year.  Two thirds of the three year programme involves nursing studies, one sixth involves biological studies and one sixth involves social science.  The application of the biological and social science studies is incorporated in nursing studies and nursing practice components of the programme are completed in years two and three.  Nurse training involves a major level of commitment and hard work.  Student nurses have a demanding role working at the coalface in theatres and caring for patients at the bedside.  They work 48 weeks of the year and nurse training cannot be compared to university or institute of technology courses.  Student nurses are practically doing a full-time job.  While student nurses on completing their training will have a qualification, nursing may not appeal to young people because of the level of commitment required and the fact that student nurses only have net income of £60 per week.  Second level students who work part-time in my supermarket <Col N="738" /> earn £2.50 an hour, but giving young people of 18 years a net income of £60 per week for three years while training means their lives are very confined.  If we are to entice good students into nursing, we need to increase the level of support to make nursing an attractive career.</P>
    <P>I am aware that nurse training will be more university-based in the future, but to make that adjustment in the short term the Minister should increase the level of support.  Student nurses get an allowance of £120 per year for books and £200 per year for their uniforms, but their travel costs are their responsibility.  Often students live quite a distance from the hospital and their travel costs can be prohibitive.  An adjustment in the level of support would be very much appreciated by the INO.  In the long-term the Department of Health would benefit considerably because it would entice students who are willing to make the commitment. Nursing is a vocation.  In the past it was glorified on TV, but nursing is hard work, particularly during the training years.  The competition is high and the bright ones pass the qualifying examination.  Nursing is not an easy profession in which to qualify.  Every encouragement should be given to the students.  It will be of great benefit in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann acknowledges and endorses the measures being taken by the Minister for Health and Children to ease the financial and other burdens on student nurses participating in the nursing registration/diploma programmes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty coming to the House to put the record of the Government before it so that the House can judge whether it has been reasonable in its approach to nursing students compared to its predecessor.  The House can also judge what the previous Government's record was in this regard and make comparisons if it so wishes.</P>
      <P>My record is as follows.  I have increased the grants for students of nursing at third level colleges by 20 per cent; I have provided special payments to students who are doing clinical placements and who must find new accommodation during those periods; where students do not have to move to new accommodation but must take up their clinical placements from their normal base, I have provided transport passes to ensure that students do not suffer financially; my Department has also moved to ensure that students do not have to pay for additional books during their course of studies in excess of the book allowances which my Department provides and that no unnecessary uniforms need to be purchased outside of the uniform allowance which is made available by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contrasts with the record of the previous Minister.  No increase whatsoever was given during <Col N="739" /> the years 1995 and 1996 and that position continued right up to June 1997 when the previous Government left office.  When the previous Minister left office not £1 extra had been given to the students during his term of office.  The student grant had remained at £2,500 during this period, having been introduced in 1994, and was not increased until this year when I reviewed it with my officials.  There was not even an allowance for a cost of living increase.</P>
    <P>In providing additional funding for the student grant I was greatly influenced by the fact that as currently arranged the academic year for students of nursing is more lengthy and the academic week for the students is more crowded than that of other third level students.  I am keen to relieve the pressure on the students, especially during their first year, when the academic part of their course is very significant.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that students should not have to sit two sets of examinations.  I recently addressed An Bord Altranais and I asked it as a matter of urgency to examine the situation whereby students must sit both sets of examination. I expect An Bord Altranais to report to my Department with a set of proposals to ease significantly the pressures upon students which arise by virtue of two sets of examinations, one of which is set by the third level college and the other by An Bord Altranais.  I have no doubt but that An Bord Altranais will report back to me with a positive revised set of arrangements.</P>
    <P>Every Government that comes into office would like to give grants to students at third level institutions which would allow them to have more financial security during their period of study. However, that is an ideal situation and we in Government, who are entrusted with the financial affairs of the country, must balance our obligations to third level students while ensuring that our obligations to the taxpayer do not result in the country spending more than it can afford on any group of people with the consequences that would follow for the economy.  The House realises that a balanced budget and continuing steady progress in improving our economy is the route to take and, in balancing the needs of students, workers and services, we can only give a certain amount to any one group.</P>
    <P>I am here to defend my record of having made a very significant increase in the grant to third level students of nursing.  I also moved to ease their financial burdens in areas where it has been brought to my attention that students had in the past suffered financial difficulties.  I am proud of the increase in the grant of 20 per cent, which the House will agree is very significant.  Deputy Hayes may claim that this is a matter of great embarrassment to him but I do not recall seeing him particularly red-faced that the previous Minister, his party colleague, gave not an extra shilling to student nurses.  I am surprised that his embarrassment only arose from the time of the change <Col N="740" /> in Government.  We can do without such nonsense in the debate.</P>
    <P>The increase I gave is £500 per student.  My main message to the House and the Opposition is that I have increased the grant by this high percentage. I emphasise that it is a grant to third level students &mdash; it is not a wage nor a salary.  It is not and was never intended to be a financial remuneration for work done in hospitals.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing is the transition from the old model to the new one.  Under the old apprenticeship model student nurses worked in hospitals and were included on the payroll.  They helped out from an early stage and were regarded as part of the staff.  What we have now are third level students studying nursing who are not nurses and who will not be nurses for a considerable period. Their studies take place not only within the school of nursing in the hospital but also in third level institutions across the country.</P>
    <P>When these students do their clinical placement they are not expected to work as part of the general staffing of a ward.  Their placements are in addition to the normal staffing.  These placements are designed specifically to ensure the students get not only the academic and theoretical part of the course but are also given the opportunity to have hands on learning in the wards with patients to ensure that what we have always regarded as being best in Irish nursing, that is, the nurse/patient relationship, does not suffer and is not diluted in the move to third level status for students of nursing.</P>
    <P>I will set the record straight with regard to the level of funding provided for students participating in the pre-registration nursing programmes of education and training, known as the nursing registration/diploma programmes.  Prior to 1994 all student nurses undertook the traditional apprenticeship model of training.  Deputies opposite made comparisons with other apprentices. We are trying to move away from the apprentice idea.  These students were part of the workforce and received an annual salary.  For the duration of their three-year programme they had the status of employees.  However, in October 1994 the first of the new diploma based programmes of education and training was introduced by University College Hospital, Galway, in association with the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Since then the programme has been extended to other sites.  The transition from the apprenticeship model to the revised model will be completed this year in all three pre-registration nursing disciplines, namely, general nursing, mental handicap nursing and psychiatric nursing.</P>
    <P>The diploma based programmes are operated by schools of nursing in association with third level institutions.  Student nurses who complete successfully the three-year programme are awarded a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute and are eligible to be registered as nurses with An Bord Altranais, the statutory regulatory body for the nursing profession. <Col N="741" /> It is important to understand that the objective of the changeover to the revised model is to enhance nurse education and training and to ensure the quality of nursing care in hospitals through the replacement of student nurses by qualified staff. This approach is in line with key recommendations contained in the report <i>The Future of Nurse Education and Training in Ireland</i> published by An Bord Altranais in 1994.  The apprenticeship model was evaluated by the board and a number of weaknesses were identified which militated against a beneficial experience for the student nurse.  These included a lack of preparedness for certain duties, insufficient clinical teaching, an emphasis on work rather than learning and an involvement in non-nursing duties.</P>
    <P>The main features of the registration/ diploma programme are the following.  Students participating in the programme have the status of third level students for the duration of the programme. Students are supernumerary to service requirements and, therefore, they are not paid a salary. Students register with the associated third level institute as well as on the candidate register of An Bord Altranais and have access to the facilities of the third level institution.  Students are examined and assessed by the associated third level institute in addition to undergoing the examination and assessment procedures prescribed in the rules of An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>Students receive an annual maintenance grant of £3,000 which is not subject to a means test. Their third level fees are paid by the Department of Health and Children through the relevant health board, hospital or agency.  Principal textbooks up to a value of £200 are supplied free of charge to students by the participating schools of nursing at the commencement of the programme. They are also supplied with free uniforms purchased for them by the relevant health agency. They are entitled to free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.  All health agencies involved in the operation of the programme have been compensated for the loss of the service contribution made by student nurses under the apprenticeship model through their replacement by a skill-grade mix of registered nurses and other grades.  It needs to be borne in mind that students on the diploma programme are students, not employees, and the level of financial support they receive must be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>When the first programme was introduced in 1994, the rate of the maintenance grant payable to students was £2,500 per annum.  As I stated earlier, the grant did not even attract the cost of inflation increases given to other third level maintenance grants when the rainbow coalition was in office during 1995, 1996 and 1997.  Deputy Shatter's party was in Government and there was a Fine Gael Minister for Health.  I have been accused of discrimination.  Fine Gael could not even pay them the cost of living increase given to every other third level student.  They were left with £2,500 per year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> It is against this abysmal record of apathy towards the burdens being experienced by students on the nursing diploma programmes that my record since I took up office must be judged. At the first opportunity I secured a £500 increase in the student grant.  This represents an increase of 20 per cent and puts the level of the grant well ahead of what it would have been if Deputy Shatter's party had seen fit to increase it in line with inflation when in Government or if the other parties had asked his party to do so.</P>
    <P>Not only did I approve a £500 increase in the annual maintenance grant from 1 March 1998, I also introduced a new external clinical placement allowance of £20 per week.  I did this specifically to assist students who are required to undertake clinical placements away from their normal base to gain specialised clinical experience.  This allowance is paid where it is necessary for the students to find accommodation away from their normal places of residence for the duration of the placements. I also approved the provision of a free weekly travel pass to students undertaking external clinical placements who do not require accommodation.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in the annual maintenance allowance and the introduction of the new external clinical placement allowance reflects my commitment to address the financial difficulties that students on the programmes were experiencing. What did the previous Administration do for them?  It was a big duck egg for three years.  If Deputies opposite wish to criticise me for what I am doing, I will simply say they were in office for three years and did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I want to be clear about these difficulties. They did not suddenly emerge this year; they have been there since the first diploma based programme was introduced in 1994 but, because of the inaction of the previous Administration, it was left to me to tackle them.  I remind the House that the extra costs of the improved package of financial supports that I have put in place for the students is in the region of £1 million in the current year alone.  I also emphasise that students participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a higher level of financial support than other third level students.  As I already indicated, each student nurse now receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000, which is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is considerably less than that paid to students of nursing.</P>
    <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programme, the students' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf.  The average annual fee per student is about £1,300.  As I already mentioned, a book allowance and a uniform allowance is also provided for each student commencing the programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health <Col N="743" /> institutions.  Taken together, the average annual value of the various supports, including the new external clinical placement allowance, is £6,000 per student nurse.  By any yardstick, this compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students and more favourably with what was available up until June 1997.</P>
    <P>I am aware criticisms have been expressed about certain aspects of the diploma based programme, particularly in relation to the front loading of the curriculum and the fact that it requires a 48 week commitment on the part of the students during the three years of the programme. I accept some of these criticisms are justified. Indeed, as recently as last week, when addressing the first public meeting of An Bord Altranais, I urged the board to examine possible ways in which the burden on students might be eased, including a rule change to address the alignment of the board's examinations with those of the third level institutes involved in the delivery of the programme.  The board is anxious to be helpful and I am confident of a positive response to my request.</P>
    <P>I also refer to the fact that the interim report of the Commission on Nursing identified a number of issues relating to the nursing diploma programmes. The commission's final report, which is due within a few months, is expected to contain recommendations to address those issues.  In addition, the nursing registration-diploma programme is currently the subject of an independent, external evaluation being undertaken by the University of Southampton, under the management of the Institute of Public Administration. This evaluation includes both the general and psychiatric nursing programmes and is due to be completed by the end of July.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that it is my firm intention, following the outcome of the deliberations of the Commission on Nursing and the evaluation team, to take steps to improve the programme and iron out the difficulties that have emerged in its operation, not least for the students themselves.  This will be done in close consultation with the relevant interest groups.  Teething problems aside, we should not lose sight of the monumental achievement that the diploma programme represents in terms of enhancing the pre-registration education and training of nurses, and in linking it to third level.  It is almost difficult to believe that the complete transition to the revised model in all schools of nursing has been achieved in the space of little more than four years.  I pay tribute to all those involved in the health and educational sectors for their tremendous efforts in developing and extending the programme.</P>
    <P>Misinformation emerged in earlier contributions, which I am sure were made in good faith. Deputy Naughten suggested there were only 800 places this year compared to 1100 last year.  A total of 1,155 training places are available this year &mdash; 781 for general nursing, 201 for psychiatric <Col N="744" /> nursing and 173 for mental handicap nursing. Last year, the figures were 734 for general nursing, 121 for psychiatric nursing and 40 for mental handicap nursing.  That was a total of 895 places and they were not successfully filled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's motion includes a call for full payment to meet the expenditure incurred in the new fourth year degree programme.  I presume he is referring to the one year full time Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing Studies course being provided by the National University of Ireland, Galway, for students who completed the first general nursing registration-diploma programme which commenced in 1994.  Successful completion of the three-year registration-diploma programme by a student nurse leads to the award of a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institution and registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais.  Upon registration the student becomes eligible for employment as a nurse.</P>
    <P>Since a degree in nursing studies is not a requirement for registration with An Bord Altranais and subsequent employment as a nurse, such a qualification must be regarded as an optional post-registration qualification.  Registered nurses wishing to undertake a course of study leading to the award of a degree in nursing studies are, accordingly, responsible for making their own arrangements for admission to, attendance at and the costs associated with such courses.</P>
    <P>My Department has never given an undertaking to students commencing the registration-diploma programme or to the associated third level institutions that it would provide funding for degree courses.  This is reflected in the fact that the agreement into which each student commencing the programme enters with the relevant health agency specifically relates to a programme of pre-registration nursing education and training of three years' duration and one which complies with the rules of An Bord Altranais and the relevant EU directives.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the development by the associated third level institutions of programmes leading to the award of a Bachelor of Nursing Studies Degree is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity of doing so.  A primary objective is to ensure that existing registered nurses are afforded equal opportunity of access to such programmes, either immediately or on the basis of a short access course.</P>
    <P>In moving to the new model it is important not to create a two tier system.  Existing registered nurses should, on the basis of equity, be equally entitled to access to the degree course as people fortunate enough to start their nursing career under the new model.  I reiterate it was never the intention that the possession of a diploma in nursing would be a requirement for admission to such programmes.  Such an approach would be totally unacceptable since it would lead to a two tier nursing structure.  I regard it as a fundamental <Col N="745" /> principle of equity that nurses who have qualified, or who will qualify through the traditional system of education and training, should not be in any way disadvantaged in obtaining posts, securing promotion or gaining access to higher education programmes as against anyone coming in under the new system.  I remind Deputy Shatter that his party colleague and my immediate predecessor as Minister, Deputy Noonan, also supported this principle.</P>
    <P>Dublin City University and Trinity College have developed part-time degree programmes. As far as I am aware, the National University of Ireland, Galway, is the only third level institution offering a full-time course specifically for diploma holders. It would be wholly inequitable to provide funding for nurses undertaking a degree course in one third level institution but not to those pursuing a course of study leading to what is essentially the same qualification in other universities.  In any event, the current system of pre-registration nursing education and training is currently predicated on a diploma based programme of three years' duration.  Any other arrangement is outside the funding arrangements agreed with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the position of students and the history of the changeover from the old apprenticeship model to the new third level arrangement. I have given the House an indication of what I have done since coming into office a little over a year ago, which is in marked contrast to the inaction of the previous three years.  I have made a significant contribution to the funding arrangements for the students, which is reflected in the substantial increase in their annual maintenance grant.  I have also moved to ease their financial situation during the period of their clinical placements, through the introduction of a new external clinical placement allowance.  Quality clinical experience has always been regarded as an important element of the course, especially in ensuring that the nurses who come through this new programme will be as highly regarded, not just within this country but internationally, as Irish nurses have traditionally been regarded for many years.  I have put my record in office before the House and have no doubt it will be judged as being as reasonable as it can possibly be, within the financial constraints that all of us must work. I have also outlined the history of the change from the old model to the new one.</P>
    <P>Within the next number of weeks one of the most important reports on nurses ever to be produced in Ireland will arrive on my desk.  I am conscious the Commission on Nursing report will be of such significance that it will change significantly the profession as we enter the next millennium. I have already indicated to the trade unions involved and to the nurse managers at their conferences that the report of the Commission on Nursing will form the most significant part of the policy in regard to the development of the profession for the future.  I am also conscious that the <Col N="746" /> Commission on Nursing will make major recommendations and will have a considerable amount to say as to the professional training and development which should be provided for nurses as we move into the next century.  I will examine these recommendations in the near future because I expect the Commission to report as planned within the next few weeks, certainly before the autumn.  I do not intend to make any other changes in the arrangements until I see this report and know the Commission's views.  I think that a reasonable and prudent position to take.</P>
    <P>These are exciting times for nurses and students.  It is important, therefore, that we build on the present considerable financial arrangements for students and continue to reframe the arrangements for professional education and training over the coming years.  It would not serve nursing well if, instead of continuing to have students of nursing regarded as third level students and to seek ways of easing the burden in terms of hours and weeks worked, we almost revert to the old apprenticeship model where students were regarded as student nurses doing some nursing work and paid accordingly.  It will not serve nursing in the future if efforts are made to revert to a situation where students are regarded as earning wages and being on the payroll during their period of training when they should be regarded as students off the payroll.  I hope the conditions of their education and training will become more akin to other third level students.  On any objective criteria, there has been a marked improvement in their present position.</P>
    <P>We await the outcome of the Commission on Nursing and commit ourselves to deal with their recommendations within the constraints in which we must work.  An Bord Altranais should come forward with further modifications to deal with the problem of two sets of examinations and the front-loading in the first year.  In my opinion, this is a genuine response which shows the Government's ability to deal with issues which were totally neglected under the last Administration.  It is fine for the Opposition to speak a year after being in Government, but for three years not one extra pound was given to student nurses for this purpose, over which so many crocodile tears are being shed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving so generously of his time to explain the facts as opposed to the rhetoric.  The Government has moved an amendment to the Opposition motion, which reeks of hypocrisy.  As the Minister said, the last Government had ample time to rectify the position of student nurses and nurses generally. The pay award it made was given grudgingly, without a view to the long-term or to the prudent management of the national finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had to take all these things into consideration.  As he rightly pointed out, this is taking place while nursing is increasingly regarding itself as a profession and taking account of <Col N="747" /> this by developing degree courses and providing a proper system of application for student nurses. It used to be the case that they worked and studied at the same time but that is no longer deemed to be acceptable.</P>
    <P>An increasingly important part of the development of modern medicine is the development of new pharmaceuticals and the new technology being brought to bear on the profession.  This will mean that nurses must have a broad base of knowledge to develop their work.  I saw this at first hand during my father's illness and the changes in the profession were striking.  Theatre nurses must grapple at the same time with drug and medicine loads and with new technology which was not dreamed of even five years ago.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government and this House looks positively at the development of nursing and the enhancement of its knowledge and skills base.  That is what the Minister is trying to do and as an indication of his good intentions he has already given student nurses the money which the previous Minister denied them by significantly increasing their grant.  Unfortunately INO members have rejected this offer in a ballot but student radicalism is not to be discouraged.  I would not put them off arguing for the maximum but they are being offered a good increase which was not available previously.</P>
    <P>In their work abroad and at home Irish nurses have reflected well on our country.  The Minister's intention is to help them develop further and it is a pity that Members opposite have scored another own goal.  They came here armed with various facts to fight the student nurses' cause but the Minister has clearly shown that they have made nothing stick and their charges are empty. What makes the public most cynical about politics is the instant outrage which is employed on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing is extremely important.  I am confident that the Minister, in his combative and determined way, will help the nursing profession develop to meet the challenges it will face in the future, given the development of modern medicine.  In the not too distant future all nurses may hold degrees as a starting point in their profession.  That is something to look forward to as it will bring increased pay and emoluments, and greater status and respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important and timely motion tabled by Deputy Shatter.  The people of this State owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the nursing profession. During last year's debate on nurses' pay, the esteem in which nurses are held by the community was made abundantly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> The previous Government recognised the incomparable contribution nurses make to public health care in this State and managed to fashion a system whereby nurses were adequately rewarded for their contribution.  The previous Government was also eager to establish a forum where nurses' concerns would be addressed.  The Commission on Nursing, which is due to report in the coming months, represents a significant industrial relations advance for the profession, which I wholeheartedly support.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were quick to beat their chests and proclaim their solidarity with the nurses.  Worthy sentiments, indeed.  However, it is when a party is in Government that its real commitment on an issue is laid bare.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the legitimate and genuine case articulated by the student nurses has been dismissive and minimalist.  The Minister and the Government have failed to comprehend and provide an adequate response to the student nurses' demands.  More importantly, they have pursued this short-sighted course despite the crisis facing health boards and hospitals in recruiting nurses.  It is an abysmal policy, dictated by a parsimonious and penny pinching Minister for Finance; if allowed to continue, it will seriously undermine the medium to long-term future of nursing and our public health system.  It is time for the Government to realise the error of its ways and immediately put in place a programme of financial and other supports which will address the concerns of student nurses.</P>
    <P>The shortage of nursing staff in our public health care system is reaching critical proportions. In recent weeks, newspaper reports have drawn attention to the fact that health authorities are, in desperation, advertising for staff in many countries abroad.  In the Dublin area alone, it is estimated there are approximately 800 unfilled nursing positions at present.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister on Question Time today.  His answers and his policy in relation to this matter do not inspire confidence. He has failed to recognise that a problem exists. However, if he took the trouble to speak to the authorities in any of the health boards, big hospitals or private or public nursing homes, he would realise there is a critical shortage of nursing staff.  The Eastern Health Board is in negotiations with the INO with a view to setting up a nurses' bank to encourage nurses who are already working full-time to work additional hours in order to fill the huge gap.  Many new developments have been delayed because of problems in recruiting nursing staff.  The situation is critical and needs the Minister's urgent attention.</P>
    <P>For too long, we have taken for granted the recruitment of nurses.  In previous years, when economic circumstances were entirely different, the flow of recruits into nursing could be assumed.  However, this is no longer the case and there has been a significant fall off in the number of people enrolling in the profession.  Young <Col N="749" /> people sitting the leaving certificate have a wide range of career choices and we cannot assume that an adequate number of them will opt to train as nurses.  In these changed economic circumstances, we need a vigorous recruitment campaign which will attract young people into a career in nursing.  We must be able to demonstrate to young people that nursing represents a very rewarding career.</P>
    <P>However, recruitment campaigns cannot be expected to produce results if the conditions of student nurses are so poor and the general structure is so unattractive.  The way we structure and resource student nurse training is an essential element in encouraging recruitment into the profession. The Minister has failed to see the relationship between falling student numbers and the conditions under which student nurses must work and study.  He has failed to recognise the recruitment crisis facing our health services, which is why his approach to this issue has been dismal.</P>
    <P>My party colleagues and I have tabled many parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science on this subject over the past few months.  In each reply received, both Ministers have been at pains to point out that student nurses fare much better than other third level students in the State.  The Minister tried again to make that case tonight.  I am constantly amazed by the poverty of analysis which lies behind this claim.  It is high time the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science realised that student nurses are in no way comparable to other students in this State.  Student nurses form a distinct and separate student body; therefore, their concerns and legitimate claims should be treated in a distinct and separate manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent the Government does not appreciate the huge gulf which separates student nurses from the rest of the student body. The Minister spoke about moving from an apprenticeship system to a third level degree system of training.  However, that has not been done in terms of the hours student nurses must put in. We must make up our minds on whether it is an apprenticeship or a full third level training course. Most other third level students work an approximately seven month year, with 15 to 20 hours of lectures a week.  That does not compare with what student nurses must do.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in this debate the Opposition will succeed in educating the Government to some extent on this issue.  I hope the Minister will adopt a new approach.</P>

      <P>They have no extended summer holiday period in which they can work to earn money for the forthcoming academic year.  They must also pay accommodation costs for the full year, as distinct from the usual academic year for which other students must pay.  Student nurses work a 35 hour week.  This workload is unique among third level students and it prevents student nurses from taking up part-time employment to supplement their income.</P>
      <P>On examination of practically every aspect of the work of a student nurse, it is patently obvious that their teaching, examination and studying structure is unique and cannot be compared with that of other students.  The Government has attempted to seek solace in the fact that student nurses receive a higher degree of financial support than other third level students.  However, when one examines the facts of the case, it is clear this is a threadbare argument which fails to stand up to any objective analysis.  The conditions and financial supports provided for student nurses need to be tailored to their work and study.</P>
      <P>It is intellectually dishonest to draw up a league table of student supports and to declare that because student nurses top the league everything is all right.  By adopting this comparative approach, the Government may be providing its spin doctors with an angle to peddle to the media but it is doing little else.  Most importantly, by insisting on this comparative approach the Government is insulting our student nurses and is failing to seriously address their genuine concerns.</P>
      <P>The motion incorporates most of the demands articulated by the Irish Nurses' Organisation on behalf of student nurses.  The refusal of the Government to adequately address these demands has led to lunch time stoppages and the recent protest march on the Department by student nurses.  On examination, the demands of student nurses certainly seem extremely reasonable. This group of workers do not expect the whole basis of social partnership to be overturned to accommodate their demands and do not expect large financial rewards from the current economic boom.  They are a group who have put up with atrocious conditions in the past number of years and who have said &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;.  I support them in their campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The student nurses are in effect asking the Government to provide them with the means to have a minimum standard of living during their three year pre-registration course and to be able to do so without having to depend on handouts <Col N="751" /> from their families.  Their demands are legitimate and should be met by the Government.</P>
    <P>The INO has requested a weekly non-means tested grant of £75 a week for all student nurses. This represents an annual grant of £3,900 per student.  I repeat that student nurses work a 35 hour week for 48 weeks of the year.  By refusing this relatively moderate increase in the student grant, the Minister is effectively telling student nurses that he does not believe they are worth £75 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to finish by 8.30, and I want to continue the points.</P>
      <P>It is a very small amount of money that barely enables an individual to eke out an existence.  It is beyond belief that at a time when Exchequer revenues are so buoyant the Government is prepared to force student nurses to survive on less than £75 a week.</P>
      <P>Student nurses and home helps are two groups within the health care system who have been treated abysmally over many years.  Now that the Government finally has the resources to make modest improvements in the standard of living of both these groups of workers, it should do so without delay.  The fact that the Government stoutly refuses to do so speaks volumes about its commitment to social cohesion.</P>
      <P>Student nurses are also asking the Government to ensure that they receive free meals for the duration of their three year pre-registration programme. It is a sad reflection of the supports we currently provide student nurses that high among their demands is a request to be fed properly.  The request for free meals is one of the strongest arguments in favour of increasing the grant available to student nurses.  The provision of free meals should be a straightforward administrative measure that would not involve great expenditure on behalf of the health boards or the State.  It should be granted.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not accede to this very modest request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of secondary accommodation on a temporary basis is also a serious issue for student nurses during their placement and one that the Government has singularly failed to deal with in any kind of adequate way.  The Minister has introduced <Col N="752" /> a £20 per week rent allowance for students in respect of this.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister read Peter Bacon's excellent report on house prices?  The facts as they pertain in the real world mean that £20 a week would hardly cover the rent of a letterbox, let alone a flat in the current market.  How does the Minister expect student nurses to make up the rest of their rent?  The answer to this question seems to be similar to the Minister's attitude to all other funding issues regarding student nurses.  This Government expects student nurses to depend on parental handouts or credit union loans to see them through their three year study period.  This is not good enough.  Student nurses put in the same number of hours as many other workers in this State.  They perform valuable work in our health service, and this must be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other main issue of concern to student nurses concerns the fourth year degree programme. The Government's stance is that this programme is not required for a student nurse to become a registered nurse, that it is additional to the required standard and, therefore, must not be funded by the State.  What message does this attitude send out to those thinking about a career in nursing?  This message is that the Department of Health is not prepared to assist nurses in developing their careers.  Of all the demands articulated by the INO this fourth year degree issue has the most significant impact on the long-term future of nursing.  Will the Minister step back from this issue and consider his vision for the future of nursing?  Surely we want to have the most professional, multiskilled nursing body possible. Central to this vision is that students who wish to proceed to degree level should be supported in doing so.  At present the system that the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister <Col N="753" /> for Education and Science are prepared to stand over actually prevents nurses' career development.  It discriminates against nurses who are prepared to study for an extra year to improve their skills and, by extension, the skills available to our health service.  It is no wonder, with such a short-sighted policy as this in operation, that a large number of student nurses who finish their three year programme do not enter the profession or that they go abroad to work.  If these issues are to be tackled, and if we are serious about valuing nurses and the work they do, the State must be prepared to invest in and support nurses who wish to proceed to degree level.  To fail to do so is a serious impediment to the development of nursing and the services which nurses provide to this community.</P>
    <P>I and the Labour Party fully support the motion as, for too long, nurses were taken for granted by the State.  The previous Government instituted measures that will go some way to rectifying this situation.  It is now up to the Government and the Minister to show that commitment to the profession and its long-term development. It is crucial, therefore, that student nurses should no longer be forced to survive for three years on a pittance.  To ensure that nursing remains an attractive career in an increasingly competitive labour market, we must support student nurses and encourage them to pursue their studies to degree level.</P>
    <P>The demands of the student nurses are reasonable and fair.  These are not outrageous demands. They are not demands that will scupper the budgetary position of this Government.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Health to fight for a health service at the Cabinet table and to secure the necessary funding to maintain standards. The Minister has so far failed to do so.  He cannot convince his penny-pinching colleague in the Department of Finance to open the purse strings to ensure that student nurses get fair play from the State.  It is a spectacular failure by the Minister and one that will have an immediate effect on thousands of student nurses and on the future of nursing as a whole if it is not reversed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Investor Compensation Bill, 1998.  I see it as a confidence building measure for the banking and insurance industries. Recent years have not been a golden era for those industries and I hope this legislation will go some <Col N="754" /> way to rectify that.  I would prefer to see self-regulation in any industry, profession or business but it has been shown that the industry we are talking about needs regulation from the State.</P>
      <P>It is important to have a system of investor compensation.  If a financial scandal of the type we have seen in the past erupts again, we should ensure that confidence in the market is maintained and any possible run on a financial institution is prevented.</P>
      <P>The figure of 20,000 ecu, which is equivalent to £15,500, will protect the small investor, the ordinary person and the majority of people who invest in the type of products pertinent to the Bill. Many of the constituents of Dublin South Central are elderly people who would have savings of approximately £10,000 so the 20,000 ecu will protect the majority of people who have investments with insurance companies.  Other people may have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds but it is their responsibility to beware of what they are investing in and the dictum <i>caveat emptor</i> applies to them.  As a nation we have become more sophisticated in our knowledge of financial instruments and it is the responsibility of people who have larger amounts to invest to ensure they invest in a reputable company.</P>
      <P>To protect small investors consideration should be given to tying in the figure of 20,000 ecu to an increase in GNP because we expect increases of 7 per cent and 8 per cent over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the question of accountability. The Central Bank has not been very forthcoming in relation to questions from the various Dáil committees.  The Central Bank has its own agenda and must protect the economic health of the country, but it is not the best institution for giving information to a committee of this House.</P>
      <P>If a major fraud occurred in the insurance industry involving hundreds of thousands of small investors, the institutions concerned should be answerable to this House, albeit through the finance committee.  We should be able to get answers to specific questions without the bank being shielded by the law under which it is currently instituted.  There should be a mechanism whereby this House can get a full account of any matter that is of major public interest.</P>
      <P>I will refer to financial services offered on the Internet.  We are now in the age of electronic banking.  There is no need to have an account in any of the associated banks.  One can have a bank account in a German, British or French bank. There is no longer any need to go to a bank to obtain money.  Last Sunday, I went to the local shop to buy the newspapers, which cost me £3.  I paid for them using my Laser card and got £40 cash back without any difficulty.  The local shops are delighted to provide this service.  I am not sure whether they get a commission on the amount they give back but it is now possible to get money from the smallest shop by using a Laser card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electronic banking, particularly with the <Col N="755" /> advent of the euro, is very much in vogue.  All the major banks in Europe have websites on the Internet and the services they offer will be taken up by Irish citizens, particularly if good interest rates are given on current accounts.  How will the Bill impact on European or other residents who avail of financial services offered on the Internet from Ireland?  How will it impact on Irish citizens who take up offers from the websites of European banks or banks in the Isle of Man or the Cayman Islands?  That aspect needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Will the Investor Compensation Company Limited which will be set up by the Central Bank to gather the funds, have a watchdog role?  Will it be able to investigate intermediaries who promise returns that do not stand up to normal criteria?  I have not seen such advertisements recently but in the past, advertisements promised a return of 36 per cent in one year if people invested in certain shares.  Some of the companies that went bust in Ireland recently engaged in advertising of a questionable standard.  I would like the Investor Compensation Company Limited to have a watchdog role to ensure that intermediaries operate in a correct manner.</P>
    <P>The certified persons under the Investment Intermediaries Act are generally accountants or other professionals.  They will probably come under regulation through their own profession but a number of professions carry out practice inspection reviews.  There should be some way to ensure that such inspections would include a review of the investment services of the particular profession.</P>
    <P>The question of how the initial contribution will be made by the investment intermediaries intrigues me.  If a calamity occurs in year two, will there be sufficient funds to pay out the appropriate compensation?  The initial years' contributions should not be too onerous.  An actuarial review of funding should be carried out from the beginning.  In the early years the compensation company should have power to borrow from the Central Bank up to a level which the actuary estimates is capable of being paid back by the end of the initial period.  In the event of a calamity I would be concerned about the period before the fund reaches a level at which, actuarially, it would be considered safe.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Law Society compensation fund will cover, as well as moneys due under legal agreements, moneys which solicitors receive as investment intermediaries.  With the advertising restrictions introduced by the Minister and the Law Society compensation fund, the rope seems to be tightening on legal eagles.  That is a reflection of the way they regulated themselves and it is also a lesson that they must pull up their socks. This is excellent legislation which I hope will be enacted soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the comprehensive nature of the Bill <Col N="756" /> which is in line with the EU investor compensation directive.  It will compensate clients who have incurred losses through investment intermediaries to the tune of £15,500, 20,000 ECUs, or 90 per cent of the loss, whichever is the lesser sum.  The extension of regulation to the retail sector by the EU was inspired by the need for proper regulation within that sector.  This legislation was needed to give people confidence in the institutions in which they invest.  A new board will be set up.  Control of the new investor compensation company will be in the hands of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to provide increased protection for consumers.  It has proven its concern under the terms of the Investment Intermediary Act, 1995, and this Bill will add to the existing powers.  The board set up by statute will have an equal number of representatives from financial services and consumer interests and will be appointed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of cases where investors lost substantial sums in the recent past through failures of the institutions they trusted. The Government perceives the need to protect the investor who loses through the failure of the institution with which he deals.  There would have been no need for this Bill a decade or even two decades ago.  Recent problems that surfaced in institutions have, however, lent an urgency to the demand for such a Bill.  An investor may now safely make an investment with any firm located in the EU.  He or she will know that compensation is in place to safeguard his or her funds to the tune of £15,500 or 90 per cent of the sum lost, whichever is lesser.  Claims may be made against stockbrokers, banks, insurance agents, brokers and financial advisers.  We are all aware of cases of financial advisers who packed their bags with old age pensioners' money and fled this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>An unorthodox scheme operated in Cork some years ago where the operator of an investment scheme took large sums of money from investors. His office was the foyer of the SIPTU union premises in Cork.  While the case had nothing to do with SIPTU, a SIPTU employee took large sums of money, invested it unwisely and paid out large interest each month to investors, many of whom were astute and, one would think, would not have been caught in such a scheme.  I am not sure whether the Minister will legislate for such circumstances where people outside of, or appointed by a financial institution take money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is self-financing.  The cost of compensation will be borne by the investment industry. All investment firms, big or small, will be obliged to contribute to the fund.  There will be exceptions for solicitors who have their own fund and accountants who have Central Bank approval for their compensation fund.  There will be substantial penalties for offences committed, with fines up to a maximum of £1 million and penalties <Col N="757" /> of up to ten years in prison, depending on the offence.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Bill will be welcomed by the small investor.  Most small investors, including old age pensioners, suffered losses of hard earned savings and could not afford to take private actions against investment companies and individuals who defrauded them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's initiative which forms part of a laudable two-pronged strategy to provide increased protection for consumers. Stricter regulations should minimise the opportunities for intermediaries to defraud their clients. As a fall-back, the Government has decided to bring in legislation to provide for a scheme of investor compensation to clients who are unable to get their funds from an intermediary.  The Government is confident that centralising responsibility for the regulation of financial intermediaries under the Central Bank and using the very extensive regulatory powers available to the bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act will provide a more effective system of regulation and will give greater protection to consumers.</P>
    <P>The board of the investor compensation company will have an equal number of directors representing the financial services industry and consumer interests.  The appointment of the board will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation.  I am sure people will be very much relieved when the Bill is passed and will feel safe in the knowledge that they can claim from the compensation board in the event of a failure.  I support the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The core purpose of this Bill is to implement the EU investment compensation directive 97/9/EC.  It establishes a framework for the compensation of investors or savers for loss of funds due to a collapse or failure, but up to a defined lesser of two limits.  This directive is a Single Market measure, in other words, the directive being transposed into domestic law relates to the implementation of the Single Market programme. It is important to appreciate this nuance, the implication of which is that its focus is not the compensation of investors but rather the even playing field in the provision of certain financial services, investment services as defined, on an EU-wide basis.  To the extent that investor compensation is an established and accepted principle in most of the European Union, it is recognised in consequence that the universal rule book must include rules that address, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the core purpose, the occasion of the enactment into domestic law of the directive is being availed of to make additional provisions in respect of the protection of investors in the essentially domestic context.  The scope of investor protection provisions in the Bill, as I understand <Col N="758" /> it, is being extended to apply to smaller investment firms and to protect small investors with such firms, essentially domestic providers and savers or investors as well as to larger firms operating on an EU-wide basis.</P>
    <P>The Single Market extends to services, including financial services, as much as to other sectors. Service companies, including companies providing financial services, banking, insurance, assurance and savings and investment services, are free to provide their services throughout the Union. Freedom to provide must, by implication, require member states' regulatory and supervisory authorities to establish a regime in respect of their activities, the effect of which would establish an even playing field across the European Union for those enterprises wishing to engage in European Union-wide trading.</P>
    <P>There are three aspects to this obligation on supervisory and regulatory authorities.  Supervisors and regulators in any member state essentially must recognise the rule of home country supervision.  If, for example, a German insurance company wishes to offer its services in Ireland, the Irish authorities must accept that if the enterprise has been approved by the relevant German authority, it must be allowed to trade in Ireland.  Equally, if an Irish firm wishes to operate in the German marketplace, the German authorities must accept its right to do so if it has been properly approved by the relevant Irish authority. Following from the home country rule, regulators and supervisors in all member states must have a minimum standard set of rules and requirements based on a principle of non-discrimination.  In other words, the regulator or supervisor in one member state cannot operate a policy, the effect of which would <i>de facto</i> operate in a protective manner <i>vis-á-vis</i> the domestic population of enterprises it is required to regulate and supervise. The Commission and the other organs of the EU, including the European Court of Justice, must have competence in an overall supervisory and policing role to ensure protectionism does not operate within the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the directive extend to investors the protection of up to 90 per cent of the amount lost or 20,000 ECU, whichever is the lesser.  The capping of compensation is intended as an acknowledgement of the <i>caveat emptor</i> rule. As is normal with such measures, the directive allows for individual member states to continue to operate provisions in excess of the minimum, where such provisions have been established.  As I understand it, that means the ceiling could be higher than 20,000 ECU, but the Minister decided not to raise the ceiling.  From the little experience I had as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, I concur to a large extent with Deputy Noonan's remarks in this regard.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Irish Presidency I was President of two councils, one of which was the Consumer Council.  As chairman of that council it was forcibly brought home to me that the rights of consumers play second fiddle in the European <Col N="759" /> order of things.  There are many areas, including social ones, where one can point to the progressive influence European Union membership has had on our domestic law, but one area of primacy relates to the question of financial institutions and measures that may confer awkward rights on consumers or consumer bodies.  Therefore, whereas we are putting in place a necessary and desirable structure, in modern day values the ceiling will not matter a great deal to the typical investor caught in the face of a collapse.  I am sure the Minister of State will accept the recoupment is small.  The Taylor affair erupted during my watch.  While the <i>caveat emptor</i> principle may have been overridden by some investors in order to stay out of the sight of the Revenue authorities, a sum of £15,500 is not very significant.</P>
    <P>An earlier speaker referred to the Finbar Ross collapse.  I also had the experience of meeting small savers who lost their life savings in the collapse of the Finbar Ross International Investments Company.  I recall, for example, meeting a deputation of such small savers led by the Larne MP, Roy Beggs, who wanted to know if it was possible to appoint an inspector at that late stage to examine the Ross débacle and to ascertain if there were assets that could have been distributed. That was a heart-rending meeting.  I recall two building workers, in particular, who were with Mr. Beggs along with a number of people from Northern Ireland where the majority of savers lived.  One of those builders had spent 39 years on the building sites in London and when he retired home to Castlebar found that every penny he had saved was gone, as Finbar Ross did a flit into the mountains, found God, and is allegedly administering to some sect.  The man whom I met at that meeting was showing the arthritic signs of 39 years of physical work on building sites and all of his savings were gone.</P>
    <P>I had to draw the conclusion, however, that it would be pointless to appoint an inspector because, in so far as I could establish, there were no assets to be distributed and while we might discover all the things we already knew and a small amount of new information, we would do nothing to recompense the people around the table.  That case is extant in the sense that I understand the offender is being brought back to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  Therefore, while this is a welcome structure in 1998, I am not sure £15,500 is meaningful.  It demonstrates the power of other directorates in the Commission as distinct from being a major conferral of rights on consumers or, in this case, savers and investors.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the extension of the investor protector scheme through the transposition of the directive into Irish law to savers and investors who would not normally be covered by the terms of the directive and who are not currently covered by an investor compensation scheme, or are covered to a debatable level.  Clients of solicitors as investment intermediaries would be an example of this.  The issue here is one of covering <Col N="760" /> the existing Law Society compensation scheme in respect of solicitors in terms of investment services that are not simply incidental to their professional services.  The provisions in the Bill purport to clarify, in favour of the investor, what is at present considered to be a moot point in respect of the extent of cover and protection provided by the Law Society scheme.  The Bill proposes to enact provisions that will allow the Central Bank approve and oversee separate investor compensation schemes operated by certified persons, in this case accountants.  I question the wisdom of exempting both solicitors and accountants in this manner.</P>
    <P>Insurance intermediaries generally are to be brought within the scope of the provisions the Bill proposes to enact in respect of all of their business, life, non life and investment services.  As the Minister of State said, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will introduce a measure which will bring insurance intermediaries into regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, with the Central Bank as the supervisory authority.  Clearly such a legislative provision is necessary from the point of view of consistency.  However, we have not been given any indication as to the timescale for the introduction of the legislation.  Will the Minister of State clarify that matter?</P>
    <P>A further matter arises from the provisions of the Bill and a commitment to a Bill in respect of the supervision of insurance intermediaries generally by the bank.  To fully appreciate the point I am raising, it is worth considering the proposals contained in the Bill on the interaction of intermediaries with product providers.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to enact provisions that subject to the scope of the compensation provisions, the activities of insurance intermediaries in regard to all their services, both life and nonlife as well as investment and pensions.  A promised Bill to be introduced by another Department will propose to subject intermediaries to the IIA and the Central Bank as the supervisory authority.  This Bill proposes to impose a duty of care on product providers <i>vis-á-vis</i> the compliance of intermediaries with the terms of the compensation scheme, that is, the provisions of this enactment, in the distribution of their products by intermediaries through imposing on such product providers a formal system of written authorisation of intermediaries in respect of the selling or distribution of the products providers' products and services, further imposing on product providers an obligation to ensure that the intermediary is in compliance with the provisions contained in this Bill on its enactment and making failure on the part of a product provider to comply with this duty of care a criminal offence, subject to significant punishment.</P>
    <P>The burden of the duty of care falls upon the product providers.  I take it this will prove controversial from the point of view of the insurance companies.  However, I am in favour of the provisions <Col N="761" /> as far as they go.  The duty of care extends only to a requirement to ensure compliance on the part of the intermediary with the terms of this proposed enactment.  In other words, it appears that the duty imposed is one of compliance with the provisions of the compensation scheme, that is, the registration with and payment into the scheme.  It appears that wider issues relating to mis-selling and provision of information to ensure informed decisions by prospective clients, what may be termed the consumerist agenda, are not dealt with.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the Bill's provisions relate only to the establishment and operation of the compensation scheme and not to the wider canvas.  It may also be argued that the core purpose of transposing into domestic law the terms of the directive has a pressing deadline and that expanding the scope of the Bill further would overly complicate and extend the drafting exercise, raising the prospect of us failing to meet the deadline.  I do not know if that is the Minister's explanation.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of evidence of significant deficiencies and shortcomings in the general regulatory and supervisory regime for financial services in Ireland.  Taylor and Reynolds are two examples and further examples were adduced by other Deputies.  The Taylor affair, for example, was detected and flagged by a UK regulatory authority, not by an Irish authority.</P>
    <P>The allegations which have been and continue to be made against the National Irish Bank group in respect of its selling and advisory activities are becoming more serious.  The allegations made last Sunday on &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; are cases in point.  These allegations come on top of what has already been discovered.  Also relevant is the evidence on the issue of prudential and consumerist supervision given by the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to the select committee on 1 April.  It was acknowledged at that meeting by all three gentlemen that the Central Bank is preoccupied with prudential considerations, not the consumer agenda.  That partly explains things which are now coming to light which are even more serious in terms of the independence of financial advice.</P>
    <P>One of the most grave matters of concern from the interview last Sunday was that the bank seemed to be, through its senior personnel concerned, complicit in tax evasion.  The depositors concerned said they wanted to bring their money back from Belfast and to avail of the tax amnesty, but they were told they could not do that.  When they asked why, they were told it was because someone would want to know where they got it. So they were told the bank had a whiz kid who could tell them what to do with it.  A financial adviser was dispatched to them and they were persuaded to put the money into the CMI scheme.  That is also an important matter to consider in terms of our reputation which is one of the reasons the Minister gave for the introduction <Col N="762" /> of this Bill.  He said it was not just about compensation but about enhancing the reputation of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill further fragment the general framework in respect of the allocation of responsibilities as between the commerce division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Central Bank.  At this stage it is relevant to ask whether the reducing rump of duties left in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be transferred <i>in toto</i> to the Central Bank with the staff of the insurance section reassigned whether to other duties in the Department, to the Central Bank or to the Department of Finance, according to preference, need and requirements.</P>
    <P>It is worth asking when considering these issues, if the time has come to bring forward a comprehensive single enactment which recognises a number of things, including the phenomenon of convergence in financial services generally, arising from, among other things, the adoption by the EU, through the banking directives, of the philosophy of <i>allfinanz</i> or <i>bancassurance</i>, as it is called in France, and the growth and development of the range of products and the resulting pressure being put on staff and intermediaries in financial services to sell these products and to drive up the share of fee based as opposed to interest margin services.  That is an important point in a low inflation environment. Little money is now being made by the institutions in terms of the traditional loan.  However, I am sure if anyone connected with the House defended this practice they would say it was being driven by the fee based system and the more clients they clocked up the more remuneration they got.</P>
    <P>There is a need to establish a strong core of independent financial advisers and a proper statutory framework for the provision of financial advice on the basis of independence, transparency and comparability of information and professionalism.  There is also an urgent need to establish a coherent supervisory and regulatory institutional structure for financial services that gives operational effect to a strong consumerist code, while also retaining and strengthening the traditional prudential framework of central banking.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this important legislation which helps to regulate our financial services and plays a part in consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Members of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service visited a number of European capital cities.  I was part of the group which went to Austria, France and Holland. It was interesting to see how their law on consumer protection has developed.  In France strict regulations apply to the extent that they claim to be over-regulated.  In Austria the regulations are not quite as strict as regards consumer protection but the banking system is closely scrutinised. <Col N="763" /> I have no doubt some good proposals will be put forward by the Finance and General Affairs Committee which will help the Minister to examine other aspects of consumer protection in the financial world.  A number of speakers said this legislation had to be put in place because of the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  It seeks to protect the Irish as well as the Community consumer.  This Bill has been well debated here and in the Seanad and the Minister has given us a comprehensive account of its provisions.</P>
    <P>On intermediaries and product producers, there will have to be a closer look at the aspect of intermediaries and how they operate.  We are inclined to focus on the product producer but it seems they have no obligation to regulate how their intermediaries work and their code of practice with the customer.  I have seen several examples of people being conned into taking out investment policies, insurance policies and various other types of investments.  There is a vast array of products on offer to the consumer. Deputy Rabbitte did not mention that intermediaries are under pressure to produce the goods. There is also the ladder of achievement and they are given generous offers such as foreign holidays and so on but at the end of the day the consumer will be victimised.  Elderly people in particular, people who may have been made redundant and may have a large redundancy payment and others who may have inherited money are victims and are preyed upon unscrupulously.  The law as it stands does not provide sufficient protection for these people.  When people realise their mistake it is too late.  This Bill will help to some extent but compensation equivalent to £15,500 is very small and does not compensate them.  Nevertheless, it is better than nothing.  Rather than looking at the compensation we need to examine the legal penalties that can be applied to these people. How stringent are the penalties?  What deterrents are there to ensure intermediaries treat the consumer fairly?</P>
    <P>In several other areas of consumer protection, for example food, we are putting stringent controls in place but in the whole area of financial services anyone can get a licence to deal with vast amounts of money.  I have seen some deal with millions of pounds.  It seems there is nothing to prevent the intermediary from advising people where to invest their money, in instances where he may have no background or qualification in financial services.  This area should be looked at closely.  My impression may be totally wrong but it seems to be happening every day.  It is rather like the racehorse industry here and the trainers who identify a victim, for example a rich American, who could be sold a dud horse.  The same applies to intermediaries.  They choose their victims and there is nothing to prevent them doing so.  Perhaps the Minister will look at this area and refer to the protections, if any, which exist to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>The product producers distance themselves <Col N="764" /> from their intermediaries although they should be held responsible for their action so intermediaries come and go.  They get into the financial world and make quick killings.  When their circle of friends, relatives, neighbours and associates is exhausted they move on to something else.  The product provider remains.  There should be an onus on him to monitor the activities of the intermediaries and ensure their products are responsibly and properly sold to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The French bankers referred to under-selling, a matter referred to by Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a question of how many customers one takes on rather than what service they will be given.  Banks are there to make profits.  The service provided must be paid, not the business of borrowing, lending and investing.  We should be careful here to ensure we have proper standards.  Given the competition between the various banks and investment agencies we must ensure there is no under-selling because this destabilises the market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte gave examples of customers being duped over the years.  As a young boy I recall the famous scam known as Shanahan's stamps which no doubt was similar to the Ross and Taylor scandals.  These people were allowed to prey on the consumer without restriction.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with establishing investors' entitlement to compensation.  Obviously, each claim for compensation will have to be clearly established: the mere existence of a receipt showing that a client entrusted funds to an intermediary, does not, for example, show that the money was not subsequently returned.  If a liquidator has been appointed to an investment firm by the courts, the liquidator will be required to establish what is owed to investors by the firm as a priority.  If a liquidator has not been appointed, the bank will appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to investors who are claiming compensation.</P>
    <P>In the case of very small investors this is a cumbersome system.  Given that intermediaries will be closely scrutinised I hope there will not be widescale collapses in future such as a recurrence of the Taylor and Ross cases.  Nevertheless, for the small investor this is a cumbersome system. A simpler system should be put in place for investors of not more than £5,000.  I realise it is much easier where a liquidator is involved.  Where a bank has to appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to investors it is a cumbersome way of doing business.  Many of these may be innocent victims of some intermediary and the idea of a bank appointing an administrator to assess what is owed could be a harrowing experience, especially if people have lost some of their savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly stated that section 34 is a key section because it provides for the payment of compensation to the client once a claim has been established.  The Investment Compensation Company will pay it.  From a cursory glance at the <Col N="765" /> debate in the Seanad, I know Senators asked how much will be paid into the fund.  No doubt the Investment Compensation Company will determine how much each company or agency must pay.  How will this be calculated?  In the case of individual intermediaries, for example, who will have to pay into the investment compensation fund?  Will it be the company, the intermediaries or others?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that compensation must be paid as soon as practicable and at the latest within three months of the date the amount lost by the client was established.  I wonder what would be the outcome of a delay due to reasons such as litigation, where claims may be challenged where an investment group could claim legitimate reasons for a collapse in their business.  If it went beyond three months, what is the fall-back then for the investor?</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  I hope it is the first in a line of legislation which will genuinely protect the consumer.  The Minister must accept that legislation to date has not protected the consumer. The Bills and provisions over the years going back to 1989 which were designed to protect the consumer have not been successful.  For that reason, we must take a serious look at the protection provided in the regulations and supervision powers under existing legislation to see how more effective they can be made.  Working with the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, we should be able to introduce strong proposals which will ensure the protection of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will endeavour to answer the points raised by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>On the level of compensation, which Deputy Noonan dealt with at length and to which Deputy Rabbitte and nearly all Deputies referred, there was some concern at what they considered to be the low level of the compensation and they asked why this was to be the case.  We are providing that investors will be entitled to claim the lesser of 20,000 ecu or 90 per cent of the amount lost.  I agree that this is by no means a fortune.  We did not set out to pretend that it was a fortune. However, our intention is to ensure that small investors are protected and we want to ensure that the compensation system we introduce will work.  Therefore, the amount of compensation is a critical decision.  If that amount is set too high, there is a danger that the compensation system will collapse under the weight of claims or that it will not get going properly in the first place.  We cannot predict what the level of compensation payouts will be over the years.  We can look back at the losses that have been suffered by investors in recent years and draw certain conclusions from that.  However, we should not forget that a reasonably low level of fraud in the past is no guarantee that there will not be catastrophic claims in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of compensation must be borne by the <Col N="766" /> financial services industry.  There is absolutely no question of investor compensation being funded by the Exchequer.  Inevitably, the cost to investment firms of their contributions to investor compensation will be passed back to investors.  This is an important point to make, particularly in response to Deputy Noonan.  Some or all of the cost will inevitably be passed back to the investors. If that cost is too high, investors will be discouraged from acting through investment intermediaries and the number of intermediaries will fall.  That could have undesirable effects on investment.  It might also not be in the best interests of investors because investors need a network of financial intermediaries to get the professional advice they need to make sound investment decisions.  A further point to consider is that investors may well be price-sensitive when it comes to paying what will, in effect, be an insurance premium for compensation cover.  The higher the level of compensation, the higher will be that premium.</P>
    <P>We already have protection for bank deposits in place and the compensation there is the same, the lesser of 20,000 ecu or 90 per cent of the sum lost &mdash; EU Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes, transposed by European Communities (deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1994.</P>
    <P>I will go some way towards accommodating what the Deputies said.  It is a point that I too considered.  We want to get the scheme set up properly and we want it to work successfully.  I will have no hesitation if I see this happening and we can increase the amount without putting an exceptional burden on the consumer, who will eventually pick up much of the cost to the industry. There was an obvious point at which to start because there are so many unpredictable elements in this.  We should start on safe ground to ensure that the scheme commences and works successfully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan queried the provision that the compensation fund would get its money before the investor, where it emerged that the liquidator of an investment firm had funds to distribute.  I was surprised at the context in which the Deputy raised this point.  This subrogation provision is a requirement of the Investor Compensation Directive. While the directive does not bind us where investment firms which are not subject to the directive are concerned, it would make things very difficult if different rules applied depending on which investment firm one employed.  We have tried to ensure that there will be a consistent entitlement to compensation across the board.</P>
    <P>I also reject Deputy Noonan's statement that 20,000 ecu is the absolute maximum an investor can get back when an investment firm defaults.  A sum of 20,000 ecu can be seen as a down-payment. If there is 20,000 ecu left in the firm, the compensation company will be recouped.  The Deputy is quite correct on that.  If there is more, the investor will be fully entitled to claim the balance. That comes back to the my earlier point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also seemed to suggest that <Col N="767" /> the Bill exempts accountants and solicitors.  Solicitors are exempt from regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, where the investment services they provide are incidental to their professional activities as solicitors.  The Law Society Compensation Fund provides for the payment of compensation to clients of a solicitor who lose money through the dishonesty of a solicitor. However, it is not clear that the fund will be obliged to pay compensation in respect of investment services provided by a solicitor where those investment services did not arise from professional activities.  That solicitor is an investment firm and should participate in investor compensation arrangements under this legislation. However, because solicitors can legitimately provide investment services without being regulated by the Central Bank, there was a potential gap in the provision of investor compensation.  Following discussions with the Law Society, it is now proposed to amend the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, to ensure that the Law Society Compensation Fund will be responsible for compensating clients of any solicitor in respect of investment and insurance business where the solicitor is not a contributor to a compensation fund managed by the Investor Compensation Company. The section also restricts somewhat the scope of the exemption for solicitors under section 2(7) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Noonan's point about the timely payment of compensation from the Law Society compensation fund, there does not appear to be a requirement in law that the fund must pay out within a set time.  However, there can, for good reason, be quite a delay between the time when a default comes to light and the payment of compensation.  One must simply establish whether a claim is good, otherwise one runs the risk that every fraudster will make a claim for compensation if there is any likelihood of a payout.  The Investor Compensation Bill provides that compensation must be paid within three months of a claim being verified, not within three months of the default or of a claim being lodged.</P>
    <P>We are making separate arrangements for accountants who provide investment services only as an incidental part of their accountancy business. In other words, accountancy practices which are not investment business firms or full-scale insurance intermediaries.  Accountants already have a separate supervisory regime under the Investment Intermediaries Act, provided they are only involved in incidental investment business. They can be regulated by their professional bodies under the overall supervision of the Central Bank.  The accountancy bodies have expressed interest in running their own schemes and we consider this appropriate because the investment business in question is incidental to their professional activities.  However, we will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also asked what will be the <Col N="768" /> level of contributions to compensation funds.  The straight answer is that we do not yet know and we have not set out in the Bill what will be the level of contributions.  This will be a matter for the investor compensation company to decide, in consultation with the Central Bank.  Obviously the amount of contributions will depend on the amount of compensation that must be paid out. There will have to be a formula which will attribute the costs of compensation fairly across investment firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that before any default occurs, intermediaries will be obliged to make contributions to the company.  How then can the level of contribution be contingent on the amount of the default?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I did not mean to give that impression, I was simply using the argument that we are not in a position to pick a figure out of the sky in respect of the number of claims that will be made.  That was one of the reasons we wanted to establish the investor compensation company to try to work out the different formulas. For example, we want to know the level at which the scale should be set in respect of different types of operators in the business or new companies that might not have a track record.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that the fund will be established immediately, in advance of the receipt of claims.  However, I must inform him that we just do not know what will be the level of claims. If a substantial number of claims are received, this will affect the level of charges to the various firms in respect of funding the compensation fund.  The position will have to be considered in that context.  That is my understanding of the situation, which, I believe, is correct.</P>
      <P>It is likely that no one formula will suit all firms and it is also likely that a number of different funds will be established.  The Bill requires the company to build up compensation funds against future claims, in other words, compensation will be pre-funded.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Noonan's query about how investor compensation will be structured let me say the following.  Accountants will be able to set up their own compensation schemes.  The number will depend on how many of the accountancy bodies decide to run investor compensation schemes for their members and, if they so decide, whether they can satisfy the Central Bank that what they are proposing will protect their clients to the standards required by this Bill.</P>
      <P>All other intermediaries will have to contribute to the compensation funds run by the company. It will be up to the company to decide how many different funds there should be.  Obviously, size counts: the bigger the fund, the better the chance it will be able to meet compensation demands. That said, there are different categories of intermediary and it may be appropriate to break them up into a small number of homogeneous groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies McDowell and Noonan asked about <Col N="769" /> the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I can confirm that the Investor Compensation Bill is scheduled to be considered by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service on Thursday week, 25 June.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked who would be entitled to receive compensation under the legislation. Section 30 sets out the basic entitlements of clients of investment and insurance intermediaries. Compensation will be payable where an investment firm is unable to discharge its liabilities to clients in respect of the provision of investment or insurance services.  The client will have to establish his or her position as a creditor of the firm.  It will not be enough to produce a receipt, there must be a clear indication that business was carried out.</P>
    <P>Investors will not be entitled to compensation simply because an investment does not work out. We are not providing for compensation on the basis of bad advice because we have no intention of becoming involved in that area in the foreseeable future.  This will not prevent people from claiming compensation where they lose money because it was badly invested.  It may be that the intermediary was at fault because he or she failed to follow the client's instructions and invested the money in the wrong place.  The question then will be whether the firm is liable, or, whether it would be held liable to repay the money to the investor if the investor sued.  If that is the case, the investor will have a valid claim for compensation. However, each claim will have to be judged on its merits and it will be the task of the administrator to establish whether the investor's claim is good.  Much will depend the nature of the agreement or the details of the contract between the intermediary and the client &mdash; that is why the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with the legal and contractual conditions applicable&rdquo; is used in section 30.</P>
    <P>I should point out again that it may well take some time to establish a client's entitlement to compensation.  The collapse of an investment firm gives an opportunity to make fraudulent claims for compensation.  Section 33 requires the liquidator or administrator to establish, as soon as practicable, the amount of compensation to which clients are entitled.  I might also draw the attention of the Deputy to the provision in section 41 which allows the Central Bank to require investment firms to hold professional indemnity insurance.  That will provide an additional layer of cover where a client loses money through negligence on the part of an investment firm.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also wondered why bonding could not be maintained alongside the investor compensation arrangements in the Bill.  At present, there is a patchwork of protection measures for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries in place.  For example, under the Insurance Act, 1989, some insurance intermediaries are required to hold a bond for £25,000 or 25 per cent of turnover.  Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, investment business firms are required to hold a bond for £50,000 or <Col N="770" /> 25 per cent of turnover.  However, bonds are not a very satisfactory way of protecting investors.  The biggest drawback is that you cannot guarantee a particular level of compensation with a bond: the proceeds of the bond, after allowing for the costs of administration, will simply be divided up between the eligible clients.  A single eligible client will do well, but a client who has to share with perhaps 20 or 30 other claimants will most likely do badly.  It is for this reason that we are replacing the present patchwork arrangement with a unified system of investor compensation. The idea is that clients of investment and insurance intermediaries will in the future have a statutory level of entitlement to compensation and that is what the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also indicated concern that the investor compensation company would merely rubber-stamp the decisions of the bank. We must be clear what will be the functions of the company.  It is primarily a mechanism for ensuring that there are adequate funds available to compensate investors.  The entitlement of investors to compensation will be a matter of law and the company's role in that regard is to ensure that the investor gets what he or she is due.</P>
    <P>Other points raised by Deputies included a watchdog role for the investor compensation company over advertising by investment firms. This role has already been given to the Central Bank as the regulator of stockbrokers and investment intermediaries.  There are detailed provisions in the Stock Exchange and Investment Intermediaries Acts to ensure that the bank has the necessary powers to prevent abuses of advertising.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the compensation company should have the power to borrow from the Central Bank.  I do not consider this to be appropriate.  There must be no question of the taxpayers subventing investor compensation, accidentally or otherwise.  However, section 13 provides that the company will have the power to borrow generally, subject to the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Noonan's point on appointments to the board of the investor compensation company, a matter on which I spoke at length, such appointments will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, the Minister must have the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment when arranging them.  In this regard I was incorrect when I said earlier that the Minister for Finance must consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; he must get her agreement.  Given this is a consumer oriented Bill, I expect there will be a proper balance in the makeup of the board to ensure that consumer interests are recognised.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte wondered if, given the discussion at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and Public Affairs which members of the Central Bank attended, there had been a change of heart.  While <Col N="771" /> I was not present at the meeting, I do not believe there has been a change.  The Governor of the Central Bank told the meeting he saw his role with regard to the regulation of the financial system as prudential.  The Bill does not change that. While the bank has an important role to play in the operation of the compensation system incorporated in the Bill, the role of the bank is technical. This is almost an inevitable consequence of the fact that the bank is the regulator for investment business firms and is expected to be the regulator for insurance intermediaries in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It will be up to the bank to make a determination that an investment firm is unable to meet its liabilities that will trigger the payment of compensation. Making a determination is first and foremost a regulatory issue.  When the bank has any evidence that an investment firm is unable, even temporarily, to meets its liabilities to clients, it will be obliged to make a determination.  As soon as that determination is made, clients of the investment firm will be free to claim against the compensation company and the amount of compensation to which they are entitled will be a matter to be settled in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the Act.  The role is a technical rather than a policy one in the area of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Deputy Noonan mentioned the working group, which the Minister has established to examine the question of consumer protection in the area of financial services, and especially the roles of the Central Bank and the Director of Consumer Affairs in this regard, both in law and in practice.  A considerable amount of work has been done by the group and a great deal of progress has been made.  Complex legal issues with regard to domestic and EU law are required to be addressed and this facet of the work is ongoing.  However, when these have been addressed I expect the group to be in a position to finalise its deliberations in the near future. Given the significance of the subject matter, it is important that whatever emerges from their considerations be the result of thorough examination.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of the single regulatory authority for the financial services area.  At present the Central Bank is the principal regulatory authority in this area being responsible for credit institutions, the Irish Stock Exchange and its members, collective investment schemes, investment intermediaries and money brokers. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced she is preparing legislation that will give the Central Bank responsibility for supervising insurance agents and brokers.  When that legislation is in place very few elements of the financial services industry will not be under the eye of the bank.  Insurance companies and credit unions are two examples.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said in favour of a single regulator, including unified standards, a reduction in bureaucracy and no room for regulatory arbitrage. <Col N="772" /> It is a brave man who would deny the benefits of this.  Whether that single regulator should be the Central Bank or another body is a matter for discussion for another day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the question of ensuring that unauthorised intermediaries are not in a position to take money from investors.  The Investment Intermediaries Act provides that any body providing investment services or advice must be authorised by the Central Bank &mdash; I dealt with this at length earlier &mdash; or must be deemed to be authorised on the basis of having a written appointment from a product producer.  The Central Bank's powers are extensive; they extend beyond authorised investment business firms. The bank has power to issue directions, which are a powerful regulatory tool and which can be backed up by the High Court, not just to authorised but unauthorised investment business firms. Section 57 of the Bill increases this power by allowing the bank to impose directions on the directors and those responsible for the management of investment business firms which are not authorised.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered most, if not all, the issues raised by Deputies.  The wish was expressed to tease matters out in greater detail on Committee Stage, which will take place next week.  I thank everybody for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework to facilitate a fresh but determined approach to meeting the accommodation needs of travellers.  The Bill will ensure implementation of the Government's commitment set in An Action Programme for the Millennium to create a new deal for travellers.  The Bill is also a key element of the Government's efforts on foot of the commitments in the action programme and Partnership 2000 to promote social inclusion and equality and to counter discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> The need for legislation to ensure more concerted efforts on the part of housing authorities to meeting the accommodation needs of travellers was among the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community, which reported to Government in July 1995.  The National Strategy for Traveller Accommodation was adopted by the previous Government following consideration of the report.  The strategy provides for the introduction of amendments to the housing, planning and development and local government legislative codes to clarify and strengthen the responsibilities and powers of housing authorities in this area.</P>
    <P>Despite much effort, the accommodation position of travellers remains unsatisfactory.  The latest annual count of traveller families undertaken last November revealed a worrying increase in the number of traveller families on the roadside or in unofficial encampments, increasing from 1,040 at the end of November 1996 to 1,127 a year later.  Up to 300 families were in temporary facilities awaiting permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, capital funding for the provision of group housing and halting sites for travellers has been increased and housing authorities have been given every encouragement to bring forward suitable traveller accommodation proposals.  The general local authority housing construction programme has also been expanded and maintained at a high level to the benefit of travellers as well as others in need of housing.</P>
    <P>However, the response of housing authorities to the accommodation needs of travellers has been somewhat uneven.  A contributory factor has been the strenuous opposition to proposals for traveller accommodation encountered by housing authorities &mdash; a trend that appears to be increasing in some areas.  This Bill will ensure a comprehensive and planned response by housing authorities which will be underpinned by wide consultative processes with travellers, the public and other authorities concerned, which should promote a better understanding of each other's positions.  The main provisions of the Bill will require relevant housing authorities &mdash; the 29 county councils, five county boroughs, five borough corporations and Bray and Dundalk urban district councils &mdash; after consultation with travellers and the public, to prepare and adopt by a date to be specified, a five year programme to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of travellers in their areas and to implement such programmes; establish on a statutory basis a national traveller accommodation consultative committee; require local authorities to set up local accommodation consultative committees; provide improved powers for local authorities to deal with unauthorised temporary dwellings; and apply relevant provisions of the housing code on anti-social behaviour to halting sites.</P>
    <P>Accurate and reliable information on needs is essential for the preparation of adequate accommodation programmes.  Section 6 amends and <Col N="774" /> extends the existing legislative provisions to ensure that assessments of the accommodation needs of travellers are integrated and co-ordinated between the authorities concerned, take account of the full range of accommodation preferred by travellers and are undertaken in consultation with travellers.  An important feature will be a requirement to assess the needs to accommodate the future growth in traveller families in respect of a period to be defined by the Minister. It is likely that period will be five years, that is, the period of the first programme.  The next significant step in the process is the preparation of a five year accommodation programme by each of the 41 relevant housing authorities.  The requirement to adopt and implement those programmes represents a significant change from the existing, largely discretionary, powers of housing authorities in this area.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 to 14 set out in detail the various procedures to be followed in the adoption of accommodation programmes.  The procedures provided for are designed to ensure that the process is comprehensive, co-ordinated, integrated and transparent and is carried out at the same time by each relevant housing authority.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the matters which must be included in a programme, for example, information on the accommodation needs of travellers, a statement of policy of the relevant housing authority on how it proposes to meet those needs and a strategy for implementing the programme. These provisions are necessary in the interests of ensuring an adequate response to the statutory requirements under the Bill, consistency and clarity of approach.</P>
    <P>There is a strong commitment throughout the Bill to consultation with the various interests concerned. Prior notice of the preparation of an accommodation programme must be given to a range of public authorities and the local traveller accommodation consultative committee to enable them to have an input.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill is the provision for a public consultative process which requires making available a draft of the accommodation programme for inspection by the public. A period of two months from the date of the newspaper notice announcing the availability of the draft is allowed for making written submissions. The manager of the local authority is obliged to report to the elected members on the results of this consultation, including the revisions, if any, made to the draft and other proposed actions by the authority.  The provisions in relation to public consultation have been further strengthened by the removal, with effect from 31 May 1998, of the exemption of halting sites from the normal planning consultation process which applies to local authority developments in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Accommodation programmes must be adopted by a date to be specified by the Minister.  Adoption is a reserved function of the authority requiring a resolution of the members.  The manager <Col N="775" /> must submit the draft programme and the report on submissions received under the public consultative process in sufficient time &mdash; not later than three months before the specified date &mdash; to enable the members to give due consideration to their contents.  However, it is recognised that unusual circumstances may arise which would make it impossible to complete consideration of the draft within three months.  Where this happens the meeting at which the motion for adoption is being considered may be adjourned for a further period of up to 21 days.  In the light of these measures I am satisfied that Members are being afforded every opportunity to give the fullest consideration to the programme submitted to them and to exercise their statutory responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>If the members fail to adopt a programme by the specified date, and I emphasise it is only in the event of such failure, the county or city manager is then obliged to adopt a programme within a further period of one month.  In doing so the manager may make such amendments to the draft as, in the opinion of the manager, are considered appropriate.  For instance, this would allow a manager to take account of the debate in the council chamber over an issue which the members were unable to resolve.  The manager would still be bound by the general requirements of the Bill and, for instance, would not be able to adopt a programme which provided for fewer units of accommodation than that required to meet the identified needs.  I know these are strong measures, but the situation merits such action.</P>
    <P>Section 16 places an obligation on an authority to take any reasonable steps necessary to secure the implementation of the programme adopted. It also requires small urban housing authorities to take such steps as are necessary for the implementation of proposals set out in an accommodation programme in respect of their areas and to have regard to the provisions of the programme when exercising any of their functions in relation to traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>Local accommodation programmes must be reviewed at least once every three years.  A local authority may carry out a review at any earlier time it considers necessary.  There is also provision under section 17 for the Minister to require more frequent reviews.  The requirements in relation to the review of programmes are most important in terms of ensuring that a programme is dynamic and takes account of the demographic changes in the traveller population.  The formal review provisions are also an essential tool in monitoring progress in implementing the five year programmes and adjusting accommodation proposals accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 18 that a power is reserved for the Minister to require programmes to be prepared jointly by two or more housing authorities and that programmes are co-ordinated or amended in such manner and by such date as the Minister may direct.  However, I see this latter <Col N="776" /> power as a safeguard to be used only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22 are a further commitment to consultation between the persons most directly concerned, the travellers, and the relevant public authorities.  New mechanisms are proposed at national and local level to ensure ongoing consultation with travellers on accommodation issues.</P>
    <P>The proposed national traveller accommodation committee puts on a statutory basis the existing consultative group but with an expanded membership.  The committee, at the Minister's request or on its own initiative, may advise the Minister on any general matter relating to the accommodation of travellers.  Detailed issues, for example those relating to specific proposals for accommodation or the needs of individual families, are outside the committee's remit.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 require each county council and county borough corporation to establish a local traveller accommodation consultative committee to advise on any aspect of traveller accommodation. The local committees must be consulted or notified in respect of certain specified matters, for example, making an assessment of needs, the preparation of a draft accommodation programme, etc.  I expect that local committees will play an important consultative role in identifying accommodation needs, the design of accommodation to meet those needs and the development of partnership arrangements to manage and maintain accommodation.</P>
    <P>Local consultative committees will comprise representatives of the members and officials of the appointing authority and representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies.  The proposed parameters for the representation of each group are intended to ensure a balance of representation and reflect the experience of a number of different approaches followed by some local authorities in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Voluntary youth organisations currently face a crisis retaining experienced staff due to their funding levels.  Funding can only come from the organisations' programmes and, therefore, the young people for whom the service is provided will lose out.  Funding for youth services needs to be increased urgently.  The commitment in Partnership 2000 was for an overall increase of £4 million for youth services.  Funding currently stands at £13.6 million, that is 0.6 per cent of the total Education budget.  Despite the youth services having been identified as one of the key areas to benefit from national lottery allocations, percentage allocations to youth services from the lottery's surplus has fallen from 27 per cent to less than 13 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> The 1998 increase in funds for the Department's youth affairs section is 1.7 per cent which will not cover the projected rate of inflation of 3 per cent and the Partnership 2000 agreement salary increases of 2.25 per cent.  The meagre increase in 1998 constitutes a net decrease when these factors are taken into account.  If this allocation is examined more closely the so-called increase will be seen to be creative accounting.  The money had already been factored in by the previous Minister of State, Deputy Allen, for services provided as far back as 1996.</P>
    <P>Youth organisations will have to curtail the services they provide for young people throughout the country thanks to the Minister's allocation. This cut in funding falls short of the Fianna Fáil election promise to combat drugs and social exclusion.  The allocation of funds for the youth at risk projects is welcome but it is to be noted that the allocation was made following pressure from the Opposition and it is concentrated on 13 areas, mainly in Dublin.  If there is not a real increase in funding for youth organisations in line with the recommendations of the Costello report the problems being experienced in urban centres will become widespread.  In the current economic climate the Minister should provide genuine increases in funding and not try to dolly up the figures, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Due to the Minister's cutbacks many youth organisations face financial crisis, especially as they may have been given loans on the basis of getting inflation proof increases from the Department. This problem is compounded by the current policy of not allocating funding until May or June.  If the Minister is interested in developing youth services he must bring forward a programme of multiannual budgeting, thereby providing service providers with a tangible opportunity to plan ahead, instead of the current haphazard method of allocating funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs has a co-ordinating role to play between Departments.  Yet, interventions by various Departments are unco-ordinated.  For example, some partnership boards, ADM groups and health boards may provide similar services to the youth organisations while pitching salaries and resources at higher levels.  This is enticing many out of the voluntary sector, thereby, starving the sector of valuable expertise.</P>
    <P>The Minister must provide additional funds immediately for the youth services grants scheme to ensure the survival of the current level of service. He should also give a commitment that the £4 million promised in Partnership 2000 will be provided over the coming 18 months.  It is a sad state of affairs that the Taoiseach is calling on the Garda to respect Partnership 2000 while the Government reneges on its commitment to the young people made in the same agreement.</P>
    <P>Many volunteers are becoming disheartened by the inadequate funding provided by the Department and this discourages those who raise funds <Col N="778" /> for the organisations.  These people are doing an invaluable service but the only thanks they get is a cut in funds from the Department.  The Minister should take the opportunity to give a real increase in the allocation to youth services.  I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors' Gallery of members of youth organisations.  I hope the Minister has good news for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is unable to be present this evening.</P>
      <P>One of my primary concerns in the context of support for youth work programmes and services is the allocation of financial assistance towards the provision of non-formal personal development and social education opportunities for young people through participation in the programmes and services of national voluntary youth work organisations, local youth work groups, special youth work projects, youth information centres and so on.</P>
      <P>Youth work organisations present valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Through participation in such organisations, life skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision making, motivation and taking responsibility can be acquired by young people.  Therefore, youth work organisations are uniquely equipped to assist young people to become full participants in society.</P>
      <P>The youth affairs section of the Department operates the youth service grant scheme under which State funding for the support of voluntary youth work is made available on an annual basis to national and major regional voluntary youth work organisations.  The continued funding of voluntary youth work organisations through the youth service grant scheme is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people.</P>
      <P>I recognise the concern felt by the youth organisations regarding the availability of increased resources for youth work and assure the Dáil that I shall continue to be unstinting in my efforts to secure increases in youth work funding.  However, the subheads from which allocations are made under the youth service grant scheme are what are termed &ldquo;non-pay subheads&rdquo;.  They are grantsin-aid which are not intended to meet the full costs arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have raised the level of funding for the youth affairs section of my Department from a sum of £3.765 million in 1987 to £13.567 million in 1998.  The 1998 figure represents an increase of 1.7 per cent over the 1997 allocation of £13.345 million.  This year sees the first full year cost implication of the provision of additional resources for youth organisations, disadvantaged youth projects and youth information centres introduced in late 1996.  The carry over of <Col N="779" /> funds allowed these initiatives to function on a percentage allocation of their operating costs in 1997.  Within my existing budget no scope exists for direct increases to youth organisations.</P>
    <P>The rise in funding in 1996 permitted the allocation of funds for the development of certain new youth work programmes and services provided by the national and major regional voluntary youth work organisations through the youth service grant scheme.  It also allowed my Department to extend provision for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth, most of which are operated by voluntary youth work organisations. In addition, the extra resources available in 1996 enabled the Department to undertake development in the network of youth information centres, all of which are operated by voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>On foot of the first ministerial report on measures to reduce the demand for drugs the Government allocated £10 million in 1997 to support the service development plans submitted by the 13 local drugs task forces.  More than £1.5 million of this amount was allocated to a number of youth work initiatives within the 13 local drugs task force areas.  In addition to the £10 million allocated in 1997, the Government decided in January 1998 on a programme for young people at risk.  The centrepiece of the programme is a young people's facilities and services fund of £30 million.</P>
    <P>Within the last few weeks the Minister of State Deputy Chris Flood has invited proposals to be funded to the tune of £20 million out of that £30 million.  The £20 million will be allocated over the next three years to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in the 13 areas identified as being particularly affected by the heroin problem. Proposals will be prepared by local development groups in each local drug task force area comprising representatives from the local drug task force, the relevant VEC and local authority. The remaining £10 million in the fund will be targeted at areas outside the task force areas where serious drug problems exist or have the potential to develop.  The arrangements for the allocation of that £10 million are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Also, in the context of attracting additional resources, my Department is working on the preparation of the heads of the youth work Bill, 1998, and my aim is to publish the Bill during the summer.  An amended legislative basis for youth work would provide an excellent statutory framework in which the phased development of comprehensive youth work services might be undertaken and, since it would ensure accountability in the expenditure of public resources, provide the opportunity of demonstrating the benefits and the value for money of youth work, ensure public funds expended on youth work programmes and services are spent efficiently and effectively, the introduction of the amending legislation should <Col N="780" /> assist us in attracting additional resources for youth work.</P>
    <P>Even though the existing youth work budget does not allow the Minister of State to grant increases to youth organisations he, as he already indicated to the National Youth Council of Ireland, is seeking supplementary funding in the current year.  He will pursue this matter vigorously and in the event of a positive outcome he will review funding support later in the year.  Furthermore, he is in the process of producing a three year funding proposal for the development of youth work services.  He has requested the observations of the National Youth Council of Ireland on my draft proposal and, following receipt of the council's observations, he intends to finalise the proposal.  On this basis, he hopes to be in a position to secure additional resources in future for youth service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed erection of an Esat Digifone mast at the Garda Barracks in Maam, County Galway, is causing great concern in the area.  It is a rural area of outstanding scenic amenity and is usually very peaceful.  I am aware of the contractual arrangements between Esat Digifone, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of Public Works and the Garda Commissioner concerning the erection of a large number of such masts &mdash; approximately 480 &mdash; at Garda stations throughout the country. When the contract was drawn up, not enough consideration was given in its terms to situations like that at Maam.  Tiernakill national school is situated in close proximity to the Garda barracks and the mast.  The mast is only 12 feet from the boundary of the school and only 27 feet from the school building.</P>
      <P>The current Garda mast has a 25 watt capacity while the proposed mast will have a 34 watt capacity.  I am not qualified to enter into the technical debate about the safety or potential danger of radiation from such masts, but I fully accept the grave and growing concern of the teachers, parents and children in the Tiernakill school catchment area.  The fear of the unknown is widespread in the community.  Parents do not know what will be added to the mast in future or what effect this will have on transmissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various Departments should have a qualified information officer whose responsibility would be to meet and inform communities, such as Maam, about all matters relating to installation and operation of such masts.  We should cut out the mystery and clearly spell out to communities exactly what the erection of such masts means, what monitoring will take place after they go into use and what safeguards the people in the area will have against breaches of the guidelines or conditions of use of such masts.  A great deal of the difficulties in Maam would have been avoided if the contract entered into with Esat Digifone <Col N="781" /> had excluded the erection of such masts at Garda stations within a certain distance of schools.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister this is a serious problem in Tiernakill national school.  I attended a public meeting there recently and the teachers and parents are angry and concerned and determined to ensure the erection of this mast should not go ahead so close to the school.  I was asked to alert the Ministers concerned that if the plans for the erection of this mast go ahead, the very future of the school could be at risk and this would be a tragedy for the area.  Maam is a rural area unparalleled in beauty and scenic amenity.  It is situated five miles and eight miles from the nearest national schools at Cornamona and Leenane.  We should do everything in our power to keep such a community alive.</P>
    <P>There is a solution to the problem.  In a Department of the Environment and Local Government booklet issued on the matter, a directive was given that new transmitters would use existing masts where they were available.  An ESB mast is available less than half a mile away and the community would have no objection to or difficulty with additional transmission facilities there. I urge the Minister to consult his colleagues, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science, to ensure no obstacle would be put in the way of allowing Esat Digifone to change the proposal and relocate their transmission equipment to the ESB mast nearby. I understand from the telephone company that it would examine the alternative location if it got the necessary assurances from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it would not be in breach of contract by any delay caused by investigating the alternative location.  I urge the Minister to liaise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and find a solution to this serious problem for the teachers, parents and pupils of Tiernakill national school, Maam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for raising this matter and I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister welcomes this opportunity to deal with what appears to be increasing concern in some communities about the agreement concluded with Esat Digifone, the second licensed mobile telephone operator, under which it has been permitted to use Garda radio masts or sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be of some assistance if I outline the background to the agreement with Esat Digifone. The arrangement arose from an approach made to the Garda authorities by the company in September 1996 with a proposal to co-locate mobile telephony equipment on Garda radio masts or sites in the context of its planned mobile telephone network.  The company indicated that in return it was prepared to pay the full rental value of the sites involved in addition to providing facilities and services to the Garda Siochána, <Col N="782" /> which would be of significant operational and strategic value.  I will return to this.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities considered the arrangements proposed by Esat Digifone to be technically feasible and of significant benefit to it in terms of its plans for the future development of its radio and telecommunications network.  Given the strong support for the proposal by the Garda authorities and mindful of the desire to avoid a proliferation of such masts as recommended in the guidelines for local planning authorities on the siting of telecommunications antennae and support structures, which were issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in July 1996, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to Esat Digifone complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a contractual agreement was concluded with Esat Digifone in early 1997 under which it is permitted to use up to 418 out of a total of 704 Garda station sites, approximately 59 per cent of stations.  The Garda station at Maam was among the 418 sites identified by the company as being of interest to it and, accordingly, comprehended by the agreement with the company. The Minister understands the proposed replacement of the existing Garda mast at Maam by Esat Digifone with a more robust structure is an exempt development under the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1997.  He is fully aware there is concern in some communities about the safety of mobile telephone technology and wishes to emphasise that he fully accepts the right of people who may have such concerns to raise them and seek explanations and assurances.  However, as far as he is aware, all reputable scientific evidence is that such systems are safe and are operated in accordance with internationally accepted standards.  The International Radiation Protection Association has prescribed internationally recognised guidelines to which operators must conform.  Reference is made to these in an appendix to the Department of the Environment and Local Government's guidelines for planning authorities, as mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>As I said, under the contract with Esat Digiphone the company is required to comply fully with the standards set out therein and the Minister is not entitled to refuse the company access to Garda sites unless the company contravenes any of the conditions associated with such access, which I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that, even if Esat Digiphone had never approached the Garda with its proposals, it was always the force's intention to replace the majority of its masts as part of its planned replacement of its national radio network.  As mentioned, some benefits associated with the Esat Digiphone agreement are operationally and <Col N="783" /> strategically important in this regard.  In addition to the payment of site rental to the State, the company has also agreed to allow the Garda access to its other sites as required to install Garda radio equipment; to use Esat Digiphone masts to provide the force with capacity on the Digiphone network for Garda communications use; to replace or erect new Garda masts where necessary and to pass them into Garda ownership; and to supply the force with a specified number of mobile telephones together with free calls for those&rsquo; phones and certain others on the Esat Digiphone network.  The total value of these benefits has the potential to reduce substantially the cost of the new Garda radio network.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes me to point out that the decision to allow Esat Digiphone access to Garda sites was not taken lightly.  Careful and detailed consideration was given to the proposals and the agreement is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment.  Should any doubts arise in this regard it would be a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the relevant planning authorities to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this urgent matter for Coláiste Eoin and I hope the Minister has some good news.  It would be incomprehensible at any time for a proposal to emerge to cut the number of teachers at this school which it is located in Finglas west, an area designated as disadvantaged in educational terms and in other ways we have come to recognise in urban areas.</P>
      <P>Coláiste Eoin is one of the most progressive vocational education committees I know.  It has run the student industry links scheme for a number of years and has encouraged young people to develop their talents in all kinds of ways against the odds.  It has won prizes in the scheme, not only in Dublin and nationally but in competition with schools all over Europe.  This is happening in a school dealing with multiple disadvantage.</P>
      <P>When the school authorities received word that its teacher numbers were being reduced in the coming school year, they were panic stricken because they will not be able to cope if the proposed cuts go ahead.  Despite the increase in student numbers, from 68 last year to over 128 this year, despite the large proportion of remedial students in the intake, who need small class groups, learning supports and alternative curricula, despite having a large number of students with behavioural problems and attention difficulties; and despite it being the last traditional VEC school catering solely for the deprived, indigenous school-going population, and despite providing an exciting, innovative and stimulating range of courses in difficult circumstances, the school is faced with these cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> I raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who has responsibility for social inclusion and the drugs issue.  The Finglas area has a number of community development projects in progress a community drugs task force has been located there, and a number of its schools have disadvantaged status.  This school not only needs the number of teachers it currently has but even more in order to cope with the problems it faces on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The decision is also surprising in light of the Government's commitment to the national anti-poverty strategy, introduced by the last Administration. I recommend the Minister reads that document, if he has not done so already, because it highlights education throughout.  It makes clear that one reason for the ongoing vicious circle of poverty in disadvantaged areas is educational disadvantage. A high proportion of the long-term and short-term unemployed are young people who have not had a full education.</P>
    <P>It is essential that schools like Coláiste Eoin are supported and not undermined through the loss of teachers.  The rule may be applied generally but it should be more flexible in its application, particularly to schools like Coláiste Eoin. I realise that every Deputy can probably argue a case for a particular school not losing teachers but I appeal to the Minister to look specifically at the job Coláiste Eoin is doing as a VEC school which runs particular courses and has had enormous success in ensuring that young people who would otherwise have had no hope for the future have been put on the path towards a fulfilling life.  The Minister should see that the rule as applied to this school will effectively undermine the excellent and dedicated work of its teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for raising this issue.  There have been no cuts in second level teaching posts this year, rather there has been an overall increase.  Coláiste Eoin is under the control of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and the staffing allocation granted to the school is a matter for the VEC.</P>
      <P>I will take the opportunity to outline how the staffing allocation granted to a VEC is determined. My Department grants a teaching staff allocation to each VEC annually, which is referred to as the initial allocation.  This allocation is determined by the enrolment in the schools under the VEC on 30 September of the previous year together with the number of ex-quota posts.  The initial allocation granted to City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for the 1998-99 school year is 799 whole-time teacher equivalents, or WTEs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of the initial allocation a VEC can submit an appeal for an increase in the staffing allocation to my Department.  An appeal may be submitted for various reasons which include a projected increase in enrolments in the scheme or particular difficulties in subject provision.  The VEC has not submitted an appeal for the 1998-99 <Col N="785" /> school year to date.  If an appeal is submitted I will be prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>To refer specifically to the position in Coláiste Eoin, the number of pupils enrolled in the school declined by 49 between September 1996 and September 1997, but I take Deputy De Rossa's point that an increase is projected for next year.  On the basis of the reduction in pupil numbers the VEC has reduced the staffing allocation to the school by 4.34 WTEs for the 1998-99 school year &mdash; that is the figure I have seen.  As stated, the allocation granted to Coláiste Eoin for a particular year is a matter for the VEC.  If enrolments in the school are projected to increase or there are other special circumstances pertaining to the school, the VEC should include the details in its appeal to me.  I will arrange for my Department to consider a teacher staffing appeal submitted by the VEC as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl as ucht an seans a fháil an cás tábhachtach seo a phlé os comhair na Dála.  Mainstream primary schools into which special needs children are integrated are paid a £50 capitation rate for the special needs children.  This is the same rate of capitation which is paid for all other pupils, yet special needs pupils attending special schools or special classes in mainstream schools qualify the schools for rates of capitation ranging from £253 to £426 for the under 12 year olds and from £413 to £426 for 12 year olds and older, depending on the disability.  It is also interesting to note that pupils in scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge attract a £70 per pupil capitation rate.</P>
      <P>The capitation rates applied to special needs children clearly demonstrate that State policy discriminates against the integration of special needs pupils into mainstream schools.  I put it to the Minister that integration should be an option for any parent of a special needs pupil.  Boards of management in schools should be given every incentive to provide for special needs pupils in mainstream primary schools.  The present capitation regime is a substantial disincentive.  It is unacceptable and discriminatory and requires urgent and comprehensive redress.</P>
      <P>Whereas this year's Estimates make no provision in this regard, I can assure the Minister that if he seeks to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to bring about the required changes in the 1998-9 school year, he will have the wholehearted support of the Labour Party.  Indeed, the cost would not be substantial for the remainder of 1998.  I strongly urge the Minister to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arguments may be advanced in regard to the cost, in particular, in order to seek to prevent this change.  However, I strongly assert that integration is good, not alone for the special needs pupils, but also for the extended school community, in that their integration brings out the best in others.  This aspect of inclusiveness is within our reach as a community &mdash; the Department <Col N="786" /> of Education and Science can be the final catalyst in its realisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this issue, which he has raised on a number of occasions in different fora.  I agree we need to invest further funding in the support of children with special needs, especially where they are integrated into mainstream schools.  The issue which needs to be considered in the context of the point raised by the Deputy is what is the best means of achieving this.  In general, I do not believe the core capitation funding system is central to this question.</P>
      <P>Capitation funding is intended to contribute towards the day to day operating costs of national schools.  The funding is intended to contribute towards the cost of such items as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general upkeep and general teaching aids required in the schools.</P>
      <P>The standard annual capitation grant payable to primary schools is £50 per pupil.  This payment is made in respect of all children enrolled in ordinary classes in a school and would, as the Deputy suggests, include any special needs children who are enrolled on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs.  These special rates can range from £253 to £426 per pupil, depending on the level of need involved.  Children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools would generally have a level of special need which renders them unable to attend ordinary national schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>The difference in the level of capitation funding attracted by pupils attending special schools or special classes and those attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis arises from the reduced number of pupils involved in each special classroom situation.</P>
      <P>The number of children per classroom in special schools and special classes will be significantly lower than the number in an ordinary national school classroom.  However, the general operating costs arising in both situations in terms of light, heating etc.  will not be reduced because of the lesser number of pupils in attendance.  As a consequence, the level of funding attracted by each child attending a special class needs to be correspondingly greater than the norm to meet the standard operating costs which will continue to be incurred.</P>
      <P>For example, a special class for children with a mild mental handicap will cater for a maximum of 13 children.  Such a classroom would give rise to the same ongoing operating costs as an ordinary classroom in a national school which would cater for a significantly higher number of pupils. It is necessary, therefore, that the special class children attract a correspondingly higher rate of capitation funding to meet the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between arrangements <Col N="787" /> relating to the funding of schools' ongoing operating costs and funding requirements which might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires a special piece of equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment.  The same situation applies to capital costs which a school may be obliged to expend to facilitate the integration of children with special needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> I also assure the Deputy that my Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised supports for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system. However, I agree with the Deputy that easier access to such funding needs to be provided and I hope to be able to move further in this direction in the future.</P>

      <P>The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry &mdash; HIPE &mdash; contains information on all discharges of patients from publicly funded acute hospitals in Ireland. The system provides detailed data on diagnosis and surgical procedures for each in-patient episode together with an indicator for discharge status which allows hospital deaths to be recorded.</P>
      <P>Data on hospital mortality from HIPE has been used from time to time on a national basis.  However, individual hospital mortality rates by procedure have not, to date, been used as a performance measure.  There are a number of difficulties concerning the interpretation of mortality data as a true performance indicator. Issues such as case complexity, age profile and the lack of a single patient identifier all need to be taken into account in any meaningful comparative analysis.  It is my view that these data sets should principally be used to health board and hospital level, in consultation with the clinicians involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy identified the need for a more critical evaluation of the outcome of services through techniques such as clinical audit. Hospital mortality rates are just one of a series of instruments which can be availed of in determining quality outcomes in our hospital <Col N="790" /> services.  The increasing involvement of clinicians in hospital management should also facilitate this process.  Other initiatives, such as the pilot programme in hospital accreditation currently under way in the Dublin academic teaching hospitals are all part of the drive to improve quality.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the continued development of quality indicators across the health services at regional and national level.  I am also conscious that one of the basic underlying requirements in any measurement of quality will be the need for objective comparisons to be made with demonstrably improve the quality of service for individual patients.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the queues for services outside the registration offices located at Joyce House 811 Lombard St East, Dublin 2, have been considerable in recent times and I regret the inconvenience to the people concerned.  The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Death and Marriages and for the Superintendent Registrar, Dublin, and registrars, who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's Office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and (Roman Catholic) marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office in particular is currently experiencing a very high level of demand for certificates which is the primary cause of the queues outside the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures have been taken to improve the situation. The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the Superintendent Registrar's Office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street and will get possession of the building from 1 July 1998.  However, I understand that it will take some weeks to commission the new offices. In the interim the board has taken steps to improve staffing levels in the Superintendent <Col N="791" /> Registrar's office in order to redress the problem. The provision of six additional staff has increased the rate of production of certificates and this has reduced the size of the queues.  Further additional staff have been sanctioned by my Department for the registration service.</P>
    <P>In a further effort to improve the situation my Department has made accommodation available in Joyce House to enable registrars of births, deaths and marriages to vacate space on the ground floor of that office with effect from 25 May 1998 to facilitate the extension of the waiting area in the Superintendent Registrars Office.  I understand that some minor structural alterations will be required and that these will be carried out as soon as possible.  The registrars have moved to more spacious accommodation which will ensure a greater level of privacy and comfort to people registering births and deaths.  These measures will considerably improve matters for the public attending at Joyce House.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Methadone Treatment Services was published in January 1998 and since then a committee has been driving the implementation of the report's recommendations. This includes the provision of treatment cards to all opiate misusers who are being prescribed methadone, providing special training for general practitioners and pharmacists already prescribing or dispensing respectively and working with general practitioners and pharmacists whose patient numbers exceed the number recommended in the report to bring their numbers down to appropriate levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main outstanding matter to be resolved in relation to the report is the putting in place of a regulation which will put the monitoring of the prescribing and dispensing of methadone on a statutory basis.  The draft text of the regulation is being discussed between my officials and the Attorney General's Office and I expect that this regulation will be in place by early July.  On this date a special prescription form will be introduced which allows for the monitoring of all prescribing under the private general medical services and methadone protocol schemes.  A lead-in time will then be required to allow for all drug misusers who are presently <Col N="792" /> in receipt of physeptone to move to the tightly controlled methadone protocol scheme.  Therefore at a later date of 1 October methadone will only be dispensed to patients for whom a drug treatment card has been issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health data and statistics are central to the provision of an efficient and effective health service.  The health status and health needs of the population must be ascertained and delivery of services appropriately planned and targeted.  In addition, service provision needs to be carefully monitored, and its contribution towards health and social gain assessed. These requirements are stated explicitly in the Department's recent statement of strategy and are reflected in improvements to the timeliness and comprehensiveness of existing information systems and in the development of new databases and analysis tools.</P>
      <P>Some of the more important initiatives are as follows, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.  The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry which captures detailed information on all hospital discharges from publicly-funded acute hospitals has been significantly improved in recent years.  It has now reached very high levels of coverage and timeliness.  It is an integral part of the Department's casemix system which is used in the allocation of hospital resources and is also a valuable source of clinical and epidemiological information.</P>
      <P>A new public health information system has been established.  This provides a minimum common data set of health indicators for morbidity and mortality by county and health board area. The system has its own software which includes mapping and graphics facilities.  It has been developed in conjunction with the directors of public health in each health board and is an invaluable tool in examining trends in health on a regional basis.  An up-dated version of the public health information system will be released in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department recently commissioned the centre for health promotion studies at University College Galway to undertake the first National Lifestyle Survey &mdash; SLAN &mdash; in Ireland.  This is now well under way and preliminary data on a range of health status measures will be available later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The National Cancer Registry published its first report in July last year and is due to publish its second report later this year.  This is an essential source of information on the prevalence of all types of cancer at national and county level, and allows international comparisons to be made.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Department established the National Intellectual Disability Database to provide a comprehensive and accurate information base for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include the establishment of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.  A pilot project in this area by three health boards has just been completed.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, will provide for the collection of statistics and other data relating to the safety of food.  A new system has been developed for the delivery of the childhood primary immunisation programme, which enables uptake levels to be measured and nonimmunised children to be identified.  In accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan, a standardised oral health database and information collection system is in the process of development.  Following the recommendations of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs, all health boards are currently establishing databases on the nature and extent of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>While the level of funding for specific initiatives is of course known, it is not possible to provide a global estimate for the total amount of funding allocated to the collection of health data and statistics.  Virtually every health service programme produces statistics as an integral part of its administrative and reporting requirements, but this activity is not usually accorded a specific budget line.  For example, my Department collects monthly data on health board financial, employment and activity indicators but there is no explicit funding at health board level for this requirement.  Likewise, the Department's systems unit provides an annual capital information technology allocation of approximately £14 million for health agencies to improve their information systems but of course not all of this sum would go directly towards generating statistical data.</P>
    <P>Health information and statistics are seen as increasingly critical in ensuring an effective, efficient and equitable health service, and the initiatives indicated above serve to illustrate my Department's commitment in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 48 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has experienced a 78 per cent increase in referrals of suspected child abuse between 1992 and 1996.  Information in relation to the number of reports awaiting investigation on a particular date is not routinely collected. However, I wish to advise the Deputy that of the 1,121 cases on the waiting list for social work services at the end of December 1997, 379 cases related to child abuse.  Because of the large volume of suspected cases of child abuse a system of priorisation must be applied.  In some cases an immediate initial assessment is undertaken, following which a decision may be made to place the referral on a waiting list.  However, children who are in immediate need of protection will receive an immediate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures followed by health boards in following up alleged cases of child abuse are in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by my Department and the 1995 procedures for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and Garda. The vast majority of child abuse and neglect cases are assessed and investigated in the context of a <Col N="795" /> social and medical assessment process.  This can be complex and long-term, depending on the nature of the specific case, the trauma suffered by victims of such abuse, and the long-term implications of any intervention and support.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that I have recently established a working group to review the existing guidelines and to prepare revised guidelines aimed at improving the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.  The working group which is representative of all the relevant interested parties held its first meeting in March and is due to report by February 1999.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are not an accurate measure of need.  They do not provide any systematic objective information about the nature of the cases. Providing extra resources solely to reduce waiting lists, without any systematic reviews or system of prioritisation, does not achieve a more efficient management of resources.</P>

      <P>The price to wholesalers &mdash; wholesale price &mdash; of drugs and medicines prescribable and reimbursable in the general medical services &mdash; GMS &mdash; scheme and in the community drug scheme is determined in accordance with the agreements between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.  Under the general medical services scheme pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price, that is, ingredient cost of the drugs, medicines and appliances dispensed plus the appropriate dispensing fee and VAT where applicable.</P>
      <P>In the case of medicines reimbursed under the community drugs schemes, that is the drugs cost subsidisation, drugs refund and long-term illness schemes, pharmacists are reimbursed the ingredient cost of the medicine plus the retail mark-up on ingredient cost, normally 50 per cent, and a standard fee.  The difference in price between the GMS and the community drug schemes is therefore accounted for by the mark-up on the ingredient cost under the community drugs schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 36 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that adverse reactions to vaccinations such as those referred to by the Deputies, while uncommon, are not entirely unexpected.  In common with most vaccines, following administration, some reactions may occur including local reactions consisting of swelling, redness and tenderness at the site of the injection and these may occasionally be serious.  The reported reactions to the &ldquo;two in one&rdquo; vaccine batch number 6015D were within the scope of recognised possible adverse reactions.</P>
      <P>At this time I am advised that the reported suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of this batch of the vaccine involved a total of 15 children and that three children required hospitalisation. All the reports involved local &mdash; injection site &mdash; reactions and all the children are reported to have made a complete recovery. None of the children is reported to have suffered any permanent damage or injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of adverse reactions to this vaccine have been closely monitored by the Irish Medicines Board, in conjunction with its appropriate expert advisory committee.  In addition the board <Col N="797" /> consulted with the manufacturer of the vaccine, with the respective health boards and with its counterpart in the United Kingdom, the Medicines Control Agency.  The board has also kept my Department fully appraised of the situation. I am advised that following the severe reactions referred to, the health boards suspended further use of vaccines from the particular batch.</P>
    <P>The board, as part of its statutory function will continue to monitor any reports of adverse reactions to this or, indeed, any vaccine or medicine so as to ensure the highest standards of public health and safety as are possible.  However, as I stated already, it is recognised that occurrences of some adverse reactions, whilst being uncommon, are inevitable and cannot be entirely eliminated.</P>
    <P>Many scientific studies have been carried out internationally which show that the advantages of vaccination far outweigh any risks which may be present.  All vaccines are extensively tested for safety and efficacy before they are licensed and they are then kept under continual surveillance.  I would therefore like to take this opportunity to urge parents to continue to have their children immunised.  The risks to their children if they are not immunised are very real.  Immunisation is extremely important, it is safe and effective; it is available conveniently from the family doctor and it is free of charge.  If sufficient numbers of children are immunised it should be possible ultimately to achieve the eradication of a range of dangerous childhood diseases.</P>

      <P>The policy in respect of the availability of oxygen and equipment to patients is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board.  In the case of medical card holders, I understand that generally where a hospital consultant has prescribed oxygen and this has been approved by the health boards' area medical officer, oxygen and equipment is supplied free of charge.  In some cases a small deposit on the equipment is required, which is generally refundable on return of the equipment e.g. oxygen cylinders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of non-medical card holders, I understand that in general patients may claim a refund in respect of oxygen under the drugs refund scheme.  With regard to equipment, patients may be required to purchase the equipment at cost price or pay a rental charge, which may be refundable under the drugs refund scheme.  I understand that in the Eastern Health Board, applications for assistance towards the cost of equipment are currently assessed on <Col N="798" /> means grounds.  However, the Eastern Health Board are now putting in place protocols to ensure that non-general medical service patients who have confirmed clinical needs will obtain a refund on equipment under the drugs refund scheme.</P>

      <P>The increase referred to relates to the waiting list for long stay facilities in St. Patrick's, Waterford and St. Joseph's, Dungarvan, which stood at six on 31 March 1997 and 13 on 31 March 1998.  There was no increase in the waiting list numbers for St. Joseph's in this period, which remained at four.  However, figures for St. Patrick's show an increase from two to nine for the same period.  I understand that the number has since reduced to seven.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board advise that the increase reflects the demand for medical services for older people in the Waterford area which has also resulted in an increased level of medical bed days in Waterford Regional Hospital.  In light of these difficulties, the South-Eastern Health Board has set up a small pilot group, representative of medical-nursing-administrative staff involved in the provision of services to older people in Waterford to examine how best the services in acute hospital, rehabilitation units and long staff facilities might best be co-ordinated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy.  An expert group was established in September 1997 to make recommendations on the clinical and non-clinical management of that group of women who received Anti-D which was infected or potentially infected with hepatitis C, but who have tested negative for the virus.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey established a &ldquo;Working Group to Review the Child Abuse Guidelines&rdquo; on 20 February 1998 with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In view of the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, changes in the management of health boards and the commitment of the Government to introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse to review (i) the guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse and (ii) the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and gardaí and to prepare revised guidelines aimed at improving the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The group has been asked to complete its work by February 1999.</P>
      <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee &mdash; NASC &mdash; which is currently chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State, has met on an on-going basis since the publication of the National AIDS Strategy Committee report in 1992.  This committee monitors progress made on implementation of the national strategy on AIDS and advises me on current issues.  Three of the subcommittees of NASC &mdash; the Care and Management Sub-committee, the Surveillance Sub-Committee and the Education and Prevention Sub-committee monitor the current situation and make recommendations regarding action to be taken in each area.  On the recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee a committee was established to examine the issues involved in the introduction of routine antenatal testing for HIV and to advise the National AIDS Strategy Committee accordingly.  Its first meeting was in April 1998 and a second meeting will take place on Wednesday, 17 June after which it will report to NASC.  An inter-departmental working group on the National Environmental Health Action Plan &mdash; NEHAP &mdash; is due to report to me before the end of summer.  A joint working group between my Department and the health boards on developing a smoke free policy is also active on an ongoing basis.  No reporting date has been set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cardiovascular health strategy group will advise on initiatives which can be taken to improve cardiovascular health through health promotion and public education.  It will also <Col N="801" /> examine and evaluate the organisation of current services and ongoing research into the causes of the treatment methods for cardiovascular disease. The evaluation is to cover all aspects of cardiovascular health including prevention of disease, medical and surgical facilities and rehabilitation services.  The group is due to report by end of summer 1998.</P>
    <P>A group is currently looking into the establishment of a heart-lung transplant unit in Ireland. The group is not committed to publishing a report.</P>
    <P>An expert advisory committee on cervical screening was established in March 1997 to oversee the piloting of the cervical screening programme. In addition it will advise on developments and best practice including quality assurance and new technologies in cervical screening, treatment etc.  The committee has a membership of 15.  It is envisaged that the committee will report to me at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>The materials management implementation group was established as an interim body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report of materials management advisory group.  It is not required to produce a report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Joint Department of Health and Children/Health Board Working Group on Medical Card Eligibility.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A joint Department of Health and Childrenhealth board working group has been established to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards.  A report from the working group will be considered by the health boards' chief executive officers at their meeting on 23 June, 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Medical Card Eligibility</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government identified as a key priority in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families.  The Department asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to consider the commitment and to give their views to the Department as to how the commitment might be implemented and the implications, financial and otherwise of their proposals. chief executive officers have undertaken to consider a report prepared for them at their next meeting on 23 June 1998 and to submit their views to the Department shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Waiting List Initiative</i>
    </P>
    <P>The group has the following terms of reference: to examine the underlying factors giving rise to waiting lists and waiting times and to make recommendations on the most appropriate means of addressing the underlying causes of substantial waiting lists and waiting times.  The review will have particular regard to: the net effect of the current waiting list initiative &mdash; WLI &mdash; on waiting lists and waiting times; any incentive effects of the WLI on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the <Col N="802" /> extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists, and the adequacy of existing information systems to permit routine evaluation of the WLI.  It is expected to report in July 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Forum on Medical Manpower</i>
    </P>
    <P>Due to report in 12 to 18 months time.</P>

    <P>Under the regulations, medical practitioners are required to notify their health board of all cases of hepatitis A, and health boards in turn notify my Department weekly of the number of cases occurring in their area.  The control of infectious diseases is the statutory responsibility of the health boards, who employ a range of appropriate measures when an outbreak occurs, which includes the identification of potential outbreaks linked to the school setting.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy on this issue is guided by the advice of the Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert group established by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  The committee's guidelines indicate that those with recent close contact with infected individuals may be considered for immunisation.  If there is evidence to suggest transmission within a school, immunisation may be considered for susceptible teachers, to cover the period of the outbreak.  In such cases the vaccine is provided free of charge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 38, 75 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>The new Tallaght Hospital will open next Sunday, 21 June.  This date was set last year by the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's hospital as the opening date for the new hospital.  Since the agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital in Tallaght, it has always been accepted that the three constituent hospitals would close when the new hospital is opened.</P>
      <P>In relation to accident and emergency services it is difficult at this stage to predict the pattern that these will take, following the relocation of some of the present services.  However, the Eastern Health Board has conducted a detailed exercise in mapping the present geographical patterns of patient flows into accident and emergency departments.  This will provide information to assist in meeting the immediate requirements of the south inner city area for accident and emergency ambulance purposes.  However, it may take a number of months before clear trends emerge. Any shifts in the pattern of accident and emergency attendances will be carefully monitored by the Eastern Health Board through its accident and emergency steering committee.  My Department will give full consideration to any recommendations which may emerge from this monitoring process.  Based on the information to hand at present, I am happy that St. James's Hospital will be able to meet the acute hospital needs of the south inner city following the opening of the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to comments made at the recent Irish Association of Social Workers conference quoting figures of 2,400 children on a waiting list for child care social work services in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The position is that the board carried out a comprehensive review of waiting lists recently which showed that at 31 December 1997 there were 1,121 cases on the waiting list of which 379 related to child abuse.  The board has experienced a 78 per cent increase in referrals of suspected child abuse since 1992.  Because of the large volume of suspected cases of child abuse a system of prioritisation is applied.  Following immediate initial assessment a decision is made to place some referrals on a waiting list.  However, children who are in immediate need of protection will receive an immediate response.</P>
    <P>The board has also engaged in a number of strategic initiatives including the preparation of procedural guidelines and manuals on assessment procedures, definition of case priorities, estimating need and determining closure procedures in relation to which children and families are eligible for and should be prioritised for welfare services.</P>
    <P>I am of course committed to designing services which meet the needs of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people and their families with an emphasis on prevention. I am pleased to have approval for the establishment of pilot projects in areas of social disadvantage which will support multi-problem families and target children at risk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Department of Health and <Col N="806" /> Children's cervical screening committee was launched as part of the national cancer strategy in March 1997.  The main thrust of the report is that cervical screening is a worthwhile preventive health measure when delivered as an organised screening programme.  The report recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, the introduction of a national organised screening programme for women in the 25-60 age group at minimum intervals of five years.</P>
    <P>The programme is being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board area to identify and resolve any difficulties which might arise.  The aim of the pilot project is to develop a cervical screening programme which runs successfully in the mid-west and can then be implemented throughout the rest of the country.  It is expected that following two years experience of the pilot the introduction of the national cervical screening programme will commence.</P>
    <P>The cervical screening committee, which I referred to earlier, included histopathologists and cytotechnologists, made many recommendations which are an integral part of overall quality assurance. These recommendations included, <i>inter alia</i>, rapid rescreening, quality control audit, workload and ongoing training for cytotechnologists.  The committee also provided guidelines for the taking of cervical smears, classification of cytological abnormalities, reporting of cervical smear results, which includes reasons for unsatisfactory smears. The report has been circulated to all cytology laboratories.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the Irish Association of Clinical Cytology have drawn up guidelines on internal quality control which were agreed at their annual general meeting on 15 May last.  In addition the expert advisory committee on cervical screening which has been appointed to oversee the piloting of the screening programme is also addressing quality assurance issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 193 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated previously to the House, there is a clear need for legislation in order to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption <Col N="807" /> contact system.  However, I did not think it prudent to proceed in this regard prior to the clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July of last year.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of his or her birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case on 13 March last and the way is now clear to legislate in the area.  However, before putting forward any proposals in this matter it is necessary for my Department to consider the judgment of the Supreme Court with great care and to consult with the various interests involved and with people with expertise in the field.  It must be remembered that what is at issue is not only the rights of persons adopted under the adoption Acts and their birth parents; but also the rights of persons separated from their birth parents in other circumstances including persons informally adopted prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Indeed, it was to persons in this category that the Supreme Court case to which I have referred related.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely complex and difficult area of human relationships and it is essential to strike the right balance between the wishes of all concerned. I have not yet made any decisions as to how I will proceed in this area but I will be listening carefully to all views before finalising my proposals so that this issue can be dealt with in a coherent, integrated and sensitive manner. Decisions regarding the specifics of what post-adoption services will be provided and the manner in which information may be released or withheld will have to await decisions on the overall legislative framework within which they will operate.</P>

      <Quest>the number of general practitioners, if any, in respect of whom he has received complaints regarding the methadone treatment programme to the effect that the general practitioner is prescribing methadone to more patients that the recommended numbers; the nature of the complaints received; the dates on which they were received; the action, if any, taken to date by his Department in this regard; whether it is his intention to furnish these complaints to the Medical Council and to request that the council conduct investigations as it deems appropriate.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>My Department investigates complaints about the prescribing of controlled drugs by general practitioners in the context of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Arising from these investigations I have the power to set up a special committee of inquiry in individual cases to investigate each case in greater detail, after which inquiry I may issue a special direction prohibiting that general practitioner from prescribing certain controlled drugs.  Under the Act there is also provision for the findings of such inquiries to be relayed to the Medical Council so that it may take whatever further action it considers necessary in relation to the general practitioner.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 does not provide for a limit on the number of patients for whom an individual general practitioner can prescribe. The question of taking action in relation to patient numbers does not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>The report of the Expert Group on the Establishment of a Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone set out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners and community pharmacists in methadone maintenance programmes.  It recommended that general practitioners should become involved by taking on responsibility for the care of opiate dependent persons who had first been stabilised at community drug treatment centres.  It also outlined the criteria necessary to ensure that methadone prescribing occurred in a controlled, responsible fashion.  Many elements of the protocol have been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone has been established.  Under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source.  However, it was only in the report of the Review Group of Methadone Treatment Services, which was published in January, 1998 that recommendations were made regarding limits on the number of patients that a general practitioner should treat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish College of General Practitioners is represented on the Methadone Protocol Implementation Committee which is overseeing the implementation of the report's recommendations and the college, together with the Eastern Health Board and my officials, are working closely with <Col N="809" /> general practitioners who prescribe to high numbers of patients, so that they can comply with the recommendations regarding numbers.  My officials have also had discussions with the Medical Council about actions being taken in relation to methadone prescribing.</P>

      <P>The Ombudsman is already empowered, under the Ombudsman Act, 1980 and related statutory instruments, to investigate complaints against my Department and against health boards, including health board hospitals, except where the action complained of relates to matters of clinical judgment.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is currently preparing draft legislation which will extend this remit.  The Government's Programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to expand the remit of the Ombudsman to include medical matters.  I am currently considering how this commitment might best be implemented and I hope to be in a position to initiate consultations on the issue with relevant interest groups in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the educational requirements for entry to pre-registration nursing education and training.</P>
      <P>The educational requirements for entry to the nursing registration-diploma programmes are standard.  In order to be eligible, applicants must possess the leaving certificate, or its equivalent, in the following six subjects: Irish &mdash; other than Foundation level; English; Mathematics &mdash; other than Foundation level; one other language; a laboratory science subject, and one other subject. Certain subject combinations are not permitted, and there are certain restrictions on the presentation of branches of home economics.</P>
      <P>As regards the grades, the requirements are as follows: a minimum grade of C/C3 in higher level papers in any two of the six subjects that I have specified and a minimum of grade D/D3 in ordinary or higher level papers in the other four subjects must be achieved in the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subjects and grades required may be accumulated over not more than two sittings of <Col N="810" /> the leaving certificate.  Additional credit of 10 per cent of the interview mark is awarded to applicants who satisfy the leaving certificate requirement in a single sitting.  The Deputy will be interested to note, however, that applicants aged 24 years or over on 15 October who do not possess the educational requirements are also eligible for consideration.</P>
    <P>The educational requirements are based on the National University of Ireland matriculation registration requirement.  This arises from the fact that the first nursing registration-programme commenced at Univesity College Hospital Galway, in association with the National University of Ireland, Galway in 1994.  I am aware that while the non-NUI third level institutions involved in the delivery of the programmes have agreed to apply the NUI requirement, some of them would prefer to apply their own admissions criteria for diploma courses, which do not include a third language requirement.  I am also aware that school guidance counsellors would favour such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing is currently examining the whole area of pre-registration nursing education and training, including the criteria and selection procedures for entry to training.  It is likely that this will form a central part of the commission's final report, which is expected later this year.  It would be my firm intention to review the present arrangements, in consultation with the relevant interest groups, in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>As regards the criteria applied in other countries, I am aware that the British teaching hospitals, for instance, invite applications from Irish school leavers who can satisfy a lower leaving certificate standard than that currently in force here.</P>

      <P>Liability is generally alleged against the State, the Attorney General, the Government Departments and the health boards concerned on the basis that these children were committed to the institutions in question on foot of court orders and that, under the Children Act, 1908, the State was under an obligation to inspect these institutions. Constitutional issues have also been raised in some of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Currently, the State is responding to in excess of 120 cases.  The question of the adequacy of staffing resources required to deal with these cases is being kept under review.  The Deputy may wish to note that the agreement of the Minister for Finance has recently been obtained to the appointment of an additional 16 staff in the child care policy unit of my Department.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary Question No. 47 of 30 April 1998 referred to a rights commissioner investigation into the case of a home help working in the South-Eastern Health Board region.  Rights commissioner investigations are carried out within specific parameters.  One of those parameters provides that these investigations should be carried out only in relation to rates of pay, hours or times of work, or annual holidays of an individual &mdash; they cannot investigate such a claim for a body of workers.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of the 30 April, the board has accepted and implemented the recommendation in respect of the individual in question &mdash; this was the claim made and the basis on which the case was heard by the rights commissioner and not objected to by the board.  Extension of such a recommendation would not be appropriate at this stage.</P>
      <P>The valuable role which is played by home helps in the overall care of older people in this country is widely recognised.  In this context, my Department has arranged to have an examination of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  I expect work to be completed on this review shortly.  When I have received the report I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.</P>

The new Registrar of Marriages for Dublin will be appointed from suitably qualified officers of the Eastern Health Board currently serving in the registration services. The Eastern Health Board is looking for a suitable location for the office of the Registrar of Marriages which will also be the venue for civil marriages.  The board has recently identified suitable accommodation in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital for this purpose.  This accommodation, which is of the order of 1,000 square feet, is in need of refurbishment and in the interim arrangements have been made to provide a temporary office for the Registrar of Marriages on the third floor of Joyce House.  This office, which will comprise an area of 500 square feet, will also have its own separate waiting area.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Marriages has been advised of these interim arrangements so that couples arranging weddings from 1 August 1998 will be informed of the location of the office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 74 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998 which represents a 50 per cent increase on the funding made available in 1997.  This funding was made available in January 1998 with the allocation to health agencies thus enabling them to co-ordinate their waiting list initiative activity with their normal activity over the full year.  This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  In addition in December 1997, my Department issued a policy circular which put in place the following arrangements relating to the waiting lists initiative.</P>
      <P>Agencies were notified in their determination of net expenditure of the level of funding available to them.  This has given agencies early notice of the money available and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.  Agencies were asked to specify targets for waiting list activity in their service plans during the year.  It is the responsibility of the chief executive officerhospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary. There will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention and agencies have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with the funding agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to maximise the effectiveness of the <Col N="815" /> waiting list initiative, I have established a review group consisting of clinicians and managers to consider the net effect of the current waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting time; any incentive effects of the waiting list initiative on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists; and the adequacy of existing information systems to permit routine evaluation of the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>I have asked the review group to report to me by the end of June so that its recommendations can be taken into account for the Estimates process in 1999 and subsequent years.  I expect to receive the report as soon as it is finalised.  I propose to make the report available.</P>
    <P>The numbers on waiting lists by hospital and by specialty are set out in the following tables. The information relates to 31 December 1997, the latest period for which validated figures are available.</P>
    <P>A total of £8 million was provided by the previous Government in 1997 for work under the waiting list initiative.  Details of the number of projected and actual procedures by specialty are set out in the following table.  These figures relate only to procedures carried out under the waiting list initiative.  Further procedures in these specialties were carried out as part of normal hospital activity.</P>

    <P>Of the £8 million allocated under the waiting list initiative in 1997, the sum of £1.7 million was specifically directed towards reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list.  A combination of approaches were used by hospitals to achieve this objective.  As well as purchasing additional cardiac surgery procedures, patients were also reassessed with a view to using alternative therapies such as interventional cardiology or medical treatment, as clinically appropriate.  I am pleased to say that this initiative was very successful in reducing the adult waiting list by 203 between September 1997 and December 1997.</P>
    <P>This year, a sum of £3 million is being made available specifically for cardiac surgery patients. As in 1997, the aim will be to reduce the overall numbers waiting for cardiac surgery and it is expected that the successful strategy applied in 1997 will be adopted again.  Final decisions on the allocation of the cardiac initiative funding will be announced shortly and I am confident that this will have a positive impact on both the overall numbers waiting and the average waiting times.</P>

      <P>The inspector of mental hospitals has a statutory obligation to inspect each psychiatric hospital and unit in the country at least once a year and to submit a report to the Minister in this respect. Once an inspection has taken place, a detailed report of the inspection, along with the inspector's recommendations, are forwarded to the chief executive officer of the responsible health board.  In each case, a response with regard to the implementation of the inspector's recommendations is requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the annual reports of the inspectorate have had a major impact in bringing about change in how we care for people with mental illness.  In his 1996 report, the inspector highlights and is complimentary of further improvements which have taken place in the mental health services.  The inspector notes that the continued development in 1996 of a comprehensive and integrated community-based mental health service was characterised by the ongoing reduction in the number of patients resident in <Col N="818" /> psychiatric hospitals through rehabilitation of long stay patients, the transfer of acute psychiatric hospital care to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals and the further extension of community based services.</P>
    <P>In his 1996 report, the inspector also makes recommendations for the improvement of services in each catchment area.  The recommendations are being considered and implemented by the health boards on an ongoing basis.</P>

Consistent with that objective, and in line with the Guidelines to Health Boards on Family Planning issued in March 1995, the following family planning services are available under the GMS scheme, namely, advice on family planning, the contraceptive pill, contraceptive devices including IUC devices, contraceptive caps and contraceptive diaphragms.  Spermicidal contraceptives and lubricating jelly for use in association with contraceptive devices are also available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 64 and 220 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of maternity services generally is the responsibility of the health board.  When an application for domiciliary services is received by a health board every effort is made to ensure an <Col N="819" /> appropriate level of service is provided.  However, because of the increase in hospital confinements over the past 20 to 25 years, and the consequent unavailability of experienced practitioners in home delivery, health boards are experiencing some difficulties in providing services for home confinements.  Where a woman chooses to engage the services of a private midwife, a contribution towards the costs involved may be made by the health board.</P>
    <P>The report of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group, which issued in April 1997 in conjunction with the Plan for Women's Health, included recommendations in relation to home birth services.  The health boards' chief executive officers have established an expert group to consider issues relating to domiciliary births and to make recommendations in relation to the piloting of different approaches.  I understand that the expert group will submit its report to the chief executive officers in the coming weeks.  In the meantime a proposal from the Eastern Health Board and Holles St. Hospital to pilot an outreach domiciliary service has been considered by my Department and arrangements in relation to the proposal are being finalised.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme provides a treatment and curative service for medical card holders.  The position is that cervical smear testing is available under the GMS scheme where it is required in the context of an individual patient's medical examination.  However, cervical smear testing is not, at present, provided by GPs under the GMS as a screening service for medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The report of the Department of Health Cervical Screening Committee recommended a national cervical screening programme for women aged 25-60 years at five year intervals. This programme will first be piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board to identify and resolve any difficulties which may become apparent.  Cervical screening will be provided free of charge to women involved in the pilot scheme and to all women on the introduction of the national screening programme.  However, pending the introduction of the national programme, the question of providing cervical screening as part of GMS scheme for women with medical cards in the relevant age category is currently under consideration within the Department.</P>

      <P>The report of the National Task Force on Suicide which was published in February 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies <Col N="821" /> and their respective responsibilities.  The action recommended in the report to reverse the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide in set out in a series of recommendations outlined in the report under the following headings: the prevention of suicide and parasuicide; intervention; aftermath and aftercare and research and evaluation.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report, I have been in contact with my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Environment and Local Government, with a view to implementing the task force recommendations in so far as these Departments are concerned.  My Department has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide.  The chief executive officers recently established the group and its inaugural meeting took place on 2 June last.  The group's main responsibilities include the review of ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, the co-ordination of research into suicide and the making of recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards which will assist in the reversal of the growing incidence of suicide.</P>
      <P>The task force identified particular at-risk groups of suicide and recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to our young people.  Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people.  In response to these concerns, I have allocated additional resources towards the development of mental health services for older people and child and adolescent psychiatric services in the current year.  It is my intention that services for these groups will continue to be developed over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that I am committed to implementing the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy recommended in the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in order to tackle this growing tragedy in our society and my Department will pursue the report's recommendations with the various agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>Additional funding is generally required in respect of existing health services to cover such items as pay increases due under national agreements, non-pay inflation, the roll forward costs of developments where they were not fully operational in the previous year and the impact of new legislation and judicial decisions.  In addition to the maintenance of existing services, the Government is committed to further developing the priority areas set out in An Action Programme <Col N="823" /> for the Millennium and my Department's strategy statement, Working for Health and Well Being.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Government provided a net additional £242 million in non-capital fundingrepresenting a 10 per cent increase over and above the 1997 outturn.  In the first instance, this funding will allow services in 1998 to be delivered at a similar level and quality to that approved in previous years.  In addition, this funding will allow for the further development of priority services such as child care, mental handicap, physical disability, mental health, dental, accident and emergency services and a range of other initiatives, including increased funding for the waiting list initiative.  In addition, capital funding of £147.25 million will be provided by the Exchequer in 1998 and this is some £15.75 million, or 12 per cent, greater than that made available in 1997.</P>
      <P>In relation to the investment required over the medium to long-term, I am currently in discussions with the Minister for Finance on the provision of additional resources for the health services over the next three years.  Within this process I will be pressing for the necessary non-capital funding to allow me maintain the quality of our core services and also to develop those aspects of our services prioritised in the Government programme and my Department's strategy statement.  In relation to capital funding, I have already agreed figures for 1999 and 2000.  A sum of £155 million will be available in 1999, with £165 million for 2000.</P>

      <P>Information of the nature sought by the Deputy is not normally held by my Department and health boards do not record such information on an ongoing basis.  I am advised, however, that health boards are in the process of changing the medical card records system in a way which will enable them in the future to identify the number of long-term unemployed persons who retain their cards on taking up employment.</P>
      <P>Since the 1996 budget provision took effect a number of problems relating to its interpretation and application in particular circumstances have come to light.  The most frequent problems arise in relation to the time of commencement of the three year retention period for those moving from subsidised employment into &ldquo;open&rdquo; employment and in relation to persons taking up part-time employment while still signing on the live register for a few days a week.  In addition, issues relating to the interpretation of the 1996 budget provision were brought to the attention of the Department by the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, INOU, and were also raised in the context of social inclusion at a Partnership 2000 monitoring meeting in October 1997.  An assurance was given that every effort would be made to ensure uniformity in the application of the provisions.</P>
      <P>A joint Department of Health and Childrenhealth board working group has been established to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards particularly as they relate to the budget 1996 provision.

      <P>When the draft terms come to hand, there will be further consultations with the society and with the solicitors acting for the health worker to ensure that all the relevant issues are encompassed in the draft terms.  I anticipate that I will be in a position after the summer recess to bring the terms of reference to the Dáil and Seanad by way of motion to establish the tribunal.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, being taken to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, particularly in view of the most recent figures showing another increase in the number of Irish women travelling to the United Kingdom for abortions; when the promised Green Paper on abortion will be published; if he has satisfied himself that access to education in relation to contraception is adequate in view of the fact that one in four babies are now born to single mothers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the further <Col N="826" /> increase in 1997 in the number of Irish women who had abortions in Britain.</P>
      <P>The issue of the number of babies being born to unmarried mothers is a complex one and there are many factors involved, not all of which are related to family planning issues.  It is not correct to assume that all such births are the result of unplanned pregnancy.</P>
      <P>My Department's guidelines on family planning policy, issued in 1995, require health boards to ensure that a full range of family planning services is accessible to all persons who require them.  At the same time the range of services provided to GMS patients was extended to include a wider range of contraception services.  Additional annual funding of approximately £2 million was provided to the health boards in 1995 and 1996 in respect of the development of family planning services and this has been maintained in subsequent years.  Since 1995 funding has also been provided to a range of voluntary agencies for the development of their pregnancy counselling services.</P>
      <P>Following the publication in March of this year of the study &ldquo;Woman and Crisis Pregnancy&rdquo;, my Department requested the health boards to consider the adequacy and comprehensiveness of the family planning and pregnancy counselling services available in their areas in the light of the study's findings.  The boards' responses are currently being considered by my Department, with a view to considering whether further measures are necessary.</P>
      <P>Work on the preparation of the Green Paper on abortion is continuing and it is hoped to publish it later in the summer.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a system of statutory registration for certain designated health and social professions, including the profession of chiropody, has been under consideration by my Department for some time.  However, despite various initiatives over recent years, great difficulties still remain in devising a system which would meet all the requirements of the various professions and which would provide for a system of self-financing self-regulation.  This issue is once again being examined within my Department at present, with other models for statutory registration being investigated in an effort to overcome the difficulties in question.</P>
      <P>There have been several attempts in recent years to establish a national school of chiropody but all such initiatives have been unsuccessful as it has not been possible to gain agreement between the various relevant groups on many of the pertinent issues.</P>

      <P>Children with HIV or who have AIDS can avail of the normal range of services which are provided in acute hospitals.  Specialist services are, however, provided in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  Funding for the services in Our Lady's Hospital commenced in 1993, with a sum of £135,000.  There has been a steady build up of funding since then with in excess of £3000,000 per annum being assigned to these specialist services.</P>
      <P>The services are overseen by a consultant in paediatrics and paediatric infectious diseases with the necessary support staff and they consist of the treatment, counselling and care for antenatal mothers with HIV and for children who are HIV positive or who have AIDS.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with physical disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community.</P>
      <P>The overall thrust of policy in relation to services for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to achieve the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual and, if at all possible, to live in the community.  This involves the provision of a range of services, such as respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including personal assistants.  My objective is to develop all of these services in accordance with the availability of the necessary funding.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated £8.4 million additional funding in 1998 for services specifically for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this funding, £3 million has been provided for the development of the services. Each health board will decide, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability, on priorities for the allocation of this funding in its functional area.  The development of personal assistance services is one of the priority areas to be considered in this process.</P>

      <P>The NRB has forwarded to me a copy of the report of its National Advisory Committee on Training and Employment, NACTE entitled, &ldquo;Employment Challenges for the Millennium &mdash; A Strategy for Employment for People with Disabilities in Sheltered and Supported Work and Employment&rdquo;.  The report is being examined by my Department at present.</P>
      <P>The report is wide-ranging.  It examines current approaches to work and employment for people with disabilities; it recommends future policy changes taking account of best international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As such the report impacts on a variety of aspects underlining current policy in the disability sector, for example, departmental responsibility, financial supports and the legal framework.  All <Col N="830" /> of these matters are being considered by my Department in conjunction with other relevant authorities.  For instance, my Department is currently addressing the issue of standards for sheltered workshops and it is envisaged that a standards working committee will be operational soon.  Another key feature of the NACTE report relates to the mainstreaming of opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the establishment group &mdash; Government decision, 18 November 1997 &mdash; under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, tasked with, <i>inter alia</i>, the preparation of proposals for a National Disability Authority is finalising its work.  An essential ingredient of its task has been to focus on the transfer of responsibility for certain aspects of training and employment for people with disabilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These developments serve as a backdrop to our consideration of the NACTE report.</P>

At the time it was decided not to implement the Directive due to the preparation of a Draft Financial Reporting Standard for smaller entities (FRSSE) by the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies, which was designed to relieve small companies of some of the burdens of financial reporting. This Financial Reporting Standard was adopted at the end of 1997. Ireland is free to implement the Directive at any stage and it is likely that there will be another review by the EU of the threshold limits in advance of the introduction of the Euro. The matter can be further examined at that stage.</entry>

    <P>
      <i>International Labour Organisation:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Of the 181 Conventions of the International Labour Organisation dating from 1919, 52 have been ratified by Ireland of which 50 are currently in force in this country.  The remaining two Conventions were ratified by Ireland on 9 June last and come into force 12 months after the date that their ratification was registered with the ILO i.e. on 9 June 1999.  It is unlikely that the majority of the remainder will be ratified by us because they are outdated or have been superseded by more modern conventions.  We are actively considering the ratification of a number of recent ILO Conventions. It should be noted that signature, as such, does not arise in the case of ILO Conventions. It is policy to ratify only those conventions <Col N="843" /> which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Ireland signed and ratified the European Social Charter which was opened for signature on 18 October 1961 in Turin.  On 14 May 1997, Ireland signed, without reservation as to ratification, the Protocol amending the European Social Charter, which was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe signatories to the Charter, in Turin, on 21 October 1991.  Ireland has not signed or ratified the 1988 Additional Protocol, the 1995 Additional Protocol to the Charter providing for a System of Collective Complaints or the revised European Social Charter (1996).  Because we adhere strictly to the principle that we should only sign and ratify those <Col N="844" /> international instruments which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.  This has led us to adopt a very cautious approach to the question of signing and ratifying the above protocols and revised charter.  This matter is undergoing detailed examination at present.</P>

    <P>Arising out of a Reasoned Opinion addressed to Ireland in 1996, pursuant to Article 169 of the EU Treaty, concerning precious metals, Ireland has agreed to make amendments to the Hallmarking (Irish Standards of Fineness) Regulations, 1983 and 1990 to introduce additional standards of fineness.  The process of drafting amending Regulations has commenced in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Assay Office.</P>
    <P>Consultations are ongoing with the Attorney General's office and the Assay Office on other complex legal issues involved.  It is hoped to resolve the issues arising as a result of the Reasoned Opinion by the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>Consultations are also ongoing with the Attorney General's Office regarding the necessity of amending national legislation to comply with an amendment to Article 1 of the Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals, to which Ireland is a party.</P>

      <P>Under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, as amended by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, no person may have petroleum in their possession or under their control except in a store licensed by the proper local authority or harbour authority, or in the case of such stores owned by a local authority or a harbour authority, in a store licensed by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The local and other relevant authorities may, at their discretion, grant or refuse an application for a licence and may attach conditions to a licence, including conditions as to its expiry or revocation.  They may also, if they think it proper, publish particulars of an application for a licence and invite representations concerning it from interested persons.</P>
      <P>Where a local authority or harbour authority refuses to grant a licence, or grants a licence on conditions with which the applicant is dissatisfied, the applicant may appeal to the Health and Safety Authority which may, at its discretion, direct the local authority or harbour authority to grant or cancel the licence, to attach specified conditions to the licence, or to amend or delete a condition attached to the licence.</P>
      <P>Where the Health and Safety Authority refuses to grant a licence, or give directions, or grants a licence on conditions with which the local authority or harbour authority is dissatisfied, the local authority or harbour authority may appeal to the High Court.  The High Court may direct the Health and Safety Authority to grant the licence, to attach specified conditions to the licence, or to amend or delete a condition attached to the licence, or in the case of an appeal from a direction, the court may confirm the direction or direct the Authority to vary it in accordance with the order of the court.</P>
      <P>The following regulations made under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, set out detailed requirements for the prevention of risk of injury to persons or property from the storage, conveying, loading, unloading and dispensing of petroleum, including the requirements to be met by applicants for licences to store petroleum; Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979 (S.  I. No. 311 of 1979) as amended by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 303 of 1988), Dangerous Substances (Petroleum Bulk Stores) Regulations, 1979 (S.  I. No. 313 of 1979). Detailed requirements relating to oil jetties are set out in the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations, 1979 (S.  I. No. 312 orf 1979).</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is developing proposals for submission to me on a range of related matters, including draft guidelines on the storage, dispensing etc.  of petroleum at retail petroleum Stores.</P>

      <P>The Foreshore Acts 1933 and 1992 enable me to take action in relation to the illegal disturbance or removal of beach material from specified areas of seashore or State-owned foreshore by way of the issue of prohibitory notices or the making of prohibitory orders, a breach of which would be an offence punishable by a substantial fine and/or term of imprisonment.  The 1992 Act moreover specifically empowers the courts to order the mitigation or remedy of the effects of any illegal removal or disturbance in such manner and within such period as they may specify.  Action is normally taken following consultation and in co-operation with the appropriate local authority, the Garda and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any particular area or areas in mind, I shall pursue urgently the question of appropriate action in the light of the facts he supplies to me.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to formal complaints to the European Commission on issues which included Ireland's afforestation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission has requested comments from the Irish Administration in respect of five complaints over the last five years on issues which included afforestation.  Of the five, two relate to alleged phosphorous pollution in lakes and a number of activities, of which afforestation is but one, are cited as being contributory factors. A third relates to an aspect of Ireland's transposition of the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment (85/337/EED); i.e. the level at which EIA should be required for certain classes of projects, one of which is afforestation.  The remaining two relate solely to afforestation, one to the alleged acidification effects of forestry in County Wicklow and one to damage alleged to have been caused to an area of scientific interest <Col N="858" /> in County Mayo.  These complaints are at various stages of investigation &mdash; responses have been submitted in all cases &mdash; and may not of course be upheld.  I should also emphasise that it is a general condition of grant-aid that forestry development is compatible with the environment and a range of controls are in place for the prevention of environmentally destructive afforestation.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the forestry development focuses on individual applications rather than on overall planning or impact; and if so, the plans, if any, he has to use a strategic approach to land use in conjunction with the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and of Agriculture and Food.</Quest>

      <P>The Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector published in 1996 sets out the economic and social rationale for the undertaking of a major afforestation programme to the year 2035.  The plan provides for both individual planters and Coillte Teoranta undertaking afforestation with the aim of doubling the country's current level of forest area of approximately 600,000 hectares to 1.2 million hectares over that period.  In this regard over one million hectares of land, predominately wet mineral soils, have been identified as being particularly suitable for afforestation.</P>
      <P>Forestry has developed as a major land use in recent years supported in particular by measures under the CAP reform to promote it as an alternative use of agricultural land and by the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry which supports development in the forestry sector generally.</P>
      <P>The current emphasis in land use policy is on the promotion and encouragement of both environmentally friendly and sustainable farming and forestry and there is ongoing liaison between my Department and the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government in this regard.</P>

      <P>As with any hazardous substance the incorrect use of herbicides could have implications for the environment.  However, the forest service of my Department does issue guidelines which cover the use of chemicals in the context of the protection of the environment.  The forest service has also supported the publication of a manual entitled &ldquo;Guidelines for the use of herbicides in forestry&rdquo; which covers safety, herbicides <Col N="859" /> in general use, their application and calibration, and is available to the sector.  The forest services's current operational procedures and standards refer forestry contractors to the health and safety legislation and direct users to be familiar with chemical manufacturers' instructions.</P>
      <P>The forest service also supports, through the European Social Fund, training courses for the forestry sector in the use of chemicals.  In addition, a Code of Best Forest Practice is currently being prepared within my Department which will cover all forestry operations including the application, handling, storage and training required in the use of chemicals.  Compliance with the code, which I expect will be available by the end of this year, will be a condition of grant-aid for all afforestation projects and will apply equally to the private and public sector.</P>

      <P>The funding available for harbour development and improvement works is limited and is, of necessity, focused primarily on the key fishery harbours.

      <P>The sea trout monitoring programme carried out by the central and regional fisheries boards for the 1998 season has just been completed.  The final results are at present being compiled by the Central Fisheries Board. However, I understand that the board has some concerns about lice levels encountered on a number of Connemara Fisheries.  I have asked the board to prepare its report as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the control of sea lice on salmon farms in Connemara, a total of 14 inspections are carried out at each farm site annually by officers authorised by me.  Inspections are undertaken once per month save for the critical period from mid-February to the end of May when two inspections per month are undertaken.</P>
      <P>Any farm where elevated lice levels are recorded or where the potential for development of elevated levels is detected are informed of this and advised to treat their fish.</P>
      <P>The results of monitoring during the 1998 critical period show that the vast majority of farms maintained extremely good control over lice infestations on their sites.  At those sites where elevated levels were encountered action was taken to reduce lice infestation on advice from the authorised officers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all farms in Connemara have entered into agreements under the Single Bay Management initiative, which is overseen by the Marine Institute on behalf of my Department. These arrangements involve commitments on lice control, annual fallowing of sites and single generation sites.  The whole thrust of the initiative is to ensure optimal control of sea lice infestation on salmon farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that minimum levels of lice on salmon farms are maintained, particularly during the critical spring smolt migration run. <Col N="861" /></P>

      <P>There are approximately 150 flagships which operate in Irish waters.  The majority of these vessels are registered in the UK, and are owned, crewed and operated by companies or individuals in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the key to dealing with the flagships is rigorous policing of fishing activity, at land and at sea as well.  Accordingly, priority is being given by all the relevant Irish authorities, through strict enforcement of the relevant regulations, to the imposition of an effective ban on all illegal activities, including overfishing, in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the problem of overfishing in Irish waters, 23 vessels registered in other member states were detained in 1997 for logbook offences.</P>
      <P>I will continue to press, in direct contacts with other member states and within the appropriate EU fora, for full co-operation towards the elimination of illegal fishing practices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Malahide Marina Village Limited holds a foreshore lease and a dumping at sea permit for the dredging operation at Malahide Marina.  The original period for the dredging operation has been extended on a number of occasions, but I should point out that the extent of the work is unchanged from that originally approved by my Department.  I understand that delays occurred due to mechanical difficulties and adverse weather conditions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the monitoring of the dumping operations, an authorised officer has not been on board the vessels used in dumping operations. However, one of the conditions of dumping at sea permit specifies that the dumping vessels, which require certification by the Marine Survey Office of my Department, should have Marine Position Recorders (MPRs) on board.  These devices record the precise location of the vessels at all times.  The output from the devices is monitored by my Department and, on a number of occasions, this method of monitoring was supported by spot checks from land based observers.</P>
      <P>Any complaints about noise from the vessels while in the Malahide Estuary should be brought directly to the attention of Malahide Marina Village Limited in the first instance.  If necessary, future dumping at sea permits could rule out operations during unsociable hours.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, one of the primary <Col N="865" /> responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs is the pursuance of Ireland's foreign policy objectives in the international arena.  In that context, a large number of international agreements covering a wide range of subjects fall under the auspices of the Department and it must consider on an ongoing basis the desirability of Ireland signing or becoming party to those agreements which it has not already signed.</P>
      <P>Given the number and range of international agreements involved, signature or accession will not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and priorisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>
      <P>In cases where it is proposed that Ireland would sign or become a party to a particular agreement, it may not always be possible to state when that will happen.  I would point, for example, to UN agreements such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organisations or between International Organisations.  While it is proposed that Ireland would accede to both conventions, the complex provisions of the conventions first require further consideration.</P>
      <P>In cases where signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration at a given time, this should not, of course, be taken to mean that signature or accession at some stage in the future has been ruled out.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a query concerning Ireland's position with regard to a particular international agreement which Ireland has not signed, she might point this out to me and I will provide her with the information she requires.</P>

      <Quest>the Acts and provisions of Acts under the auspices of her Department which, as of 1 June 1998, are not in force because a commencement order has not been made; whether it is proposed to make an order in each case; and, if so, when this will be made.</Quest>

      <P>A commencement order has not been made in respect of Part III of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, to give effect to four 1975 Protocols to the Warsaw Convention. All four protocols have been ratified by Ireland. The Warsaw Convention established minimum levels of liability for, <i>inter alia,</i> the carriage of passengers and cargo; and the four protocols updated the compensation limits of the Warsaw Convention.  However, the first two protocols only became part of international law in 1997. The question of making a commencement order to give effect to these two Protocols is being examined in the light of recent developments under EU legislation dealing with issues similar to those covered by the Warsaw Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Basic standards for the protection of the health of the general public and workers in the EU against the dangers arising from ionising radiation are laid down in Council Directive 80/836 EURATOM of 15 July 1980, as amended by Council Directive 84/467 Euratom of 3 September 1984.  The provision of these basic safety standards directives have been enshrined in Irish law.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the BSS Directives were further amended by Council Directive 96/29 EURATOM of 13 May 1996.</P>
      <P>The BSS Directives are based on the Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.  They cover all normal and accident situations and prescribes radiation dose limits for workers and members of the public. Irish legislation is in the course of being amended to take account of the 1996 Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding a nuclear accident scenario, the <Col N="875" /> directives set out in the radiation protection principles for actions to be taken to prevent or decrease the exposure of individuals to radiation. They require each member state to establish intervention levels and these have laid down for Ireland in the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents.</P>
    <P>In addition to these directives, there are a number of EU regulations which were adopted following the Chernobyl accident.  In 1990, an EU Council Regulation was adopted to control the imports of agricultural products products orginating in third countries.  In addition, regulations laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident were also adopted &mdash; these latter regulations would be brought into force in the event of a future nuclear accident affecting the EU.</P>
    <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency has also issued international basic safety standards for protection against ionising radiation.  These are similar to those of the EU.</P>
    <P>Given the range of existing EU regulations and directives in place, I do not consider it appropriate to raise this issue with the IAEA.</P>

      <P>At present my Department is in the process of formulating legislation to amend the Defence Act, 1954, to give effect to the recommendations for a revised organisation and structure of the Defence Forces arising from the recent review of the forces which was undertaken under the aegis of the Efficiency Audit Group.  In accordance with Government approval on the matter, the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is being drafted at present.  The draft text of the Bill will be brought to Government as soon as possible for approval and for authority to present it to the Dáil and to circulate it.</P>
      <P>A draft of an amending order to the Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1929 &mdash; No. 206 of 1939 &mdash; in respect of membership of the Irish Red Cross Society has been forwarded by my Department to the office of the parliamentary draftsman for approval.</P>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations, which are required to be made pursuant to many of the provisions of the Defence act, 1954, undergo continuous review in my Department and, where necessary, are amended to take account of changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>It also advises that applications should be in writing and should indicate that the information is sought under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  If information is desired in a particular form i.e., photocopy, computer disk, etc., this should also be mentioned in the application.  Applicants should give as much detail as possible to enable the staff of the Defence Forces to identify the record.  If an applicant has difficulty in identifying the precise records required, the staff of the Defence Forces will be happy to assist in preparing the request.  Requests will be acknowledged within two weeks and the applicants will be informed of the name of the person dealing with the request.  The guidance note also asks that applicants include a telephone number or some other contact system such as the local gardaí in order that their bona fides can be established.</P>

      <P>Arising from the recommendations of an efficiency scrutiny of the Department of Defence commissioned by the Efficiency Audit Group, the Government, in April 1993, approved the implementation of proposals to give greater financial delegation to the military authorities.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, the amount of expenditure delegated to the military authorities has increased annually.  The total amount delegated to the military in 1998 is £76.5 million, which represents 64 per cent of the Defence Forces element of the Vote, excluding pay and compensation.  The question of further delegation is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>There are significant differences between the Irish and British court-martial systems.  Irish military personnel, in common with all other citizens, have rights arising from our written Constitution.  This constitutional jurisprudence has been applied increasingly in the military legal sphere in recent years.  Also, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is a civil court, has full appellate jurisdiction over the finding and sentence of any court-martial.  It is considered that our court-martial system conforms with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  I do not consider that any legislative change is required to the court-martial system as operated currently.</P>

      <P>The position is that two agreements which have been signed are awaiting ratification and the question of signing two others is at present under consideration.  Details are as follows. The International Cocoa Agreement 1993 was opened for signature at New York on 16 August 1993.  Ireland signed the agreement, subject to ratification, on 16 February 1994.  The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  It is proposed that Ireland will ratify the agreement when all EU member states are also in a position to do so.</P>
      <P>The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants of 2 December 1961 as revised at Geneva on 10 November 1972 and 23 October 1978 was ratified by the Government in May 1981.  The convention was again revised at Geneva in March 1991.  That revised version was signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification, on 27 February, 1992.  The international organisation responsible for the agreement is the International Union for the Protection of new Varieties of Plants.  The domestic legislation to facilitate ratification &mdash; the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill &mdash; is currently before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals which was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 13 November 1987, was negotiated through the Council of Europe and has not yet been signed or ratified by Ireland.  The convention has been under examination to determine its full implications and a decision on its signature and ratification will be made in due course.</P>

    <P>Protocol of Amendment to the Europen Convention for the Proteciton of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes which was opened for signature on 6 February, 1992, in Strasbourg was negotiated <Col N="885" /> through the Council of Europe.  It has not yet been signed or ratified by Ireland owing to the need for legislative change.  The convention was ratified on 7 April 1986 by Ireland and entered into force on 8 October 1986.  Rules are in force at EU level, which include elements of the convention.  Discussions are taking place on a proposal for a general directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have investigations made of the circumstances surrounding a person's entitlements to extensification for 1996 and 1997, which have been significantly reduced and denied in view of the difficulty with an 1996 beef premium application which was subsequently amended and partially included in 1997 at the direction of his office in Portlaoise; if he will refer this case to the appeals mechanism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person named submitted an application during 1996 under the special beef premium scheme which contained certain inaccuracies on foot of which a two year exclusion from the scheme was decided.  During the course of the appeals procedure the penalty was reduced to a one year exclusion.  The person named was advised that, for his own benefit, applications lodged after the application which gave rise to the proposed exclusion from the scheme were not admissible in 1996, but could be submitted in 1997.  Following further consideration of the case and in the light of additional evidence presented by the person named it was decided that the penalty to be applied should only affect the application in question.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the reduction in 1996 extensification premium referred to by the Deputy, concerns the animals contained in the applications which the person named was advised were not eligible to be submitted for premium until 1997 rather than in 1996.  Similarly, the inclusion of these applications in 1997 has implications for that year's extensification premium.  These applications will now be re-examined as part of an overall review of the extensification premium entitlements of the person named for 1996 and 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the regulations or guidelines, if any, governing the level of charges that may be imposed by private planners in regard to the REP scheme; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some planners have significantly increased their charges and, in some cases, they can charge up to £700 for an initial plan, when the procedure can often consist of little more than submitting an ordnance survey map; if he will consider regulating these charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The level of charges imposed by planners in connection with services provided to participants in the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; is essentially a matter between the planner and the farmer.  The role of my Department consists of ensuring that there is an adequate number of approved REPS planners. There are currently over 950 REPS planners either working individually or with private approved agencies and Teagasc.  The compilation of a REPS plan requires the planner to draw up a comprehensive five year agri-environmental plan which addresses the management of the holding in some detail under a number of headings, along with provision of a map of the lands farmed. Therefore, I do not consider that there is a necessity to regulate charges at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of applications per planning agency per year is set out in the following list. The exact numbers of 50 per cent compliance and 5 per cent prepayment checks carried out per agency per year are not readily available.</P>
      <P>Cases for checking are selected centrally on a monthly basis at random from the list of applicants who are due payments.  A 50 per cent sample is chosen from those who are due a second or subsequent payment and inspections are carried out to ensure compliance with the farmer's agri-environmental plan.  The checks are carried out subsequent to submission by the participant of an application for payment.</P>
      <P>Pre-payment inspections are carried out on 5 per cent of new applicants and on 5 per cent of those applying for second and subsequent payments. The main purpose of this check is to ensure that the farmer's agri-environmental plan has been prepared in accordance with the Department's agri-environmental specifications, but it also involves an on farm visit for second and subsequent years' applications.</P>

      <P>The total number of pigs in Ireland at the latest Central Statistics Office Survey was 1,717,000.  There are approximately 2,400 registered pig holdings of which 729 are designated as commercial units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey to establish the level of salmonella in the Irish pig herd was completed in late February 1997.  The tests were carried out on samples from the gastro intestinal tract (caecal swabs) and on extracts from the gall bladder.  The results of this survey showed that salmonella was isolated from between 12.0 per cent and 13.2 per cent of the samples taken in seven slaughter plants involved in the survey.  A total of 1,282 samples were taken in the survey from 225 pig herds.  Further tests were carried out for salmonella typhimurium (St). These showed a 4.5 per cent prevalence of St in gall bladder samples and 7.2 per cent in caecal swabs.  Phage Type DT 104 was found in three of the isolates.  A later survey carried out in conjunction with the industry broadly confirmed these findings.  It is important to understand that the samples taken were of caecal and gall bladder material and that slaughter hygiene at processing plants is aimed at preventing contamination of the edible parts of the carcase from such sources. Salmonella is common in pigs worldwide.  Four countries have implemented comprehensive control programmes including Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. <Col N="895" /></P>

      <P>The current tax package for forestry provides that profits are exempt from income and corporation tax. However, losses arising from forestry cannot be offset against other income.  Compared to agriculture where the return from investment occurs within a relatively short number of years and on an annual basis, investment in forestry is of a long-term nature.  Depending on the type of tree, it can take anything up to 30 or 40 years before the trees are mature enough to be harvested and profits realised.  The strategy for forestry proposes to achieve an afforestation target of 17 per cent of (suitable) land cover by the year 2030. Currently, Irish forestry accounts for 8 per cent of suitable land cover as compared to an EU average of 31 per cent.  The tax treatment of forestry is intended to encourage investment in this sector.</P>

The Bretton Woods (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is designed to effect an Irish contribution to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the International Monetary Fund.  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill will extend the remit of the Ombudsman and make provision for Administrative Procedures.  A general scheme of a valuation Bill is currently being considered by the Government.  No decision has been made on the proposal at present.

      <P>Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1992 and the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 (as amended): amendments are being prepared to the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme to provide for the pensionability of certain allowances granted under recent legislation.

    <P>Statutory instruments are also being prepared in Revenue to amend previous statutory instruments relating to the designation of certain areas for the purposes of incentive tax reliefs provided under Section 39, as amended, of the Finance Act, 1994 (Urban Renewal tax incentives).  This amendment is necessary because the qualifying period for the incentives was extended in the 1998 Finance Act for projects which meet certain criteria. In addition, the orders will need to take account of the new section numbers applying under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Statutory Instruments to implement EU Directives 97/52/EC and 98/4/EC: legislation is being prepared to give effect to certain provisions in the following agreements to allow Ireland to proceed to ratify these agreements.</P>

      <P>The benefits under the scheme, referred to by the Deputy, are targeted at people who are severly and permanently disabled with regard to mobility.  Mental handicap, of itself, does not qualify a person for tax relief under the scheme. Where a person, irrespective of his/her age, satisfies the appropriate director of community care and medical officer of health that he or she meets the qualifying criteria set down in the regulations governing the scheme, a primary medical certificate is issued for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners, who operate the scheme on a daily basis.  Where the issue of the certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal to the medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The scheme covers both disabled drivers and disabled passengers.  In the case of a qualifying disabled passenger, a family member, who resides with and is responsible for the transport of the qualifying disabled person, may apply for tax relief in respect of a suitably adapted vehicle which has been puchased for transport of the disabled person.  The Deputy may obtain further information on the scheme from the Central Repayments Office, Coolshannagh, Monaghantelephone 047-82800.</P>

      <P>The two main tax reliefs which were introduced to encourage investment in third level education are section 485 and section 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Section 485, formerly section 16 of the Finance Act, 1997, provides tax relief for personal and corporate gifts of money of £1,000 or more to approved third level institutions for an &ldquo;approved project&rdquo;.  Project means: (a) the undertaking of research, (b) the acquisition of equipment, (c) certain infrastructural development and (d) the provision of facilities designed to increase student numbers in areas of skill needs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science must certify projects on the basis of guidelines agreed with me.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they do not have statistical information on the number and value of applications as requested.</P>
      <P>Section 843, formerly section 25 of the Finance Act, 1997, as amended by section 44 of the Finance Act, 1998, provides for the granting of capital allowances at 15 per cent per annum, 10 per cent in year seven, for capital expenditure projects in the third level education sector where at least half of the cost of the project is to be meet from private subscriptions.</P>
      <P>In the 1997-98 tax year, I approved two applications for relief under this provision and a further application is on hands.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of other tax reliefs relating to third level education and a brief description of these is given below for the Deputy's information.  All the following sections may be found in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997: section 474, relief for fees paid to private colleges for full-time third level undergraduate education; and section 475, relief for fees paid for part-time third level undergraduate education.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the most recent estimate of the number of applications for these two reliefs for the 1997-8 tax year is 957 claimants at a cost of £0.3 million.  These figures for the 1997-8 tax year are provisional and are likely to be revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information from income tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide an estimate of the number of claims for the following tax reliefs for investment in higher education except for section 792 for which some data in respect of corporate <Col N="907" /> donations is available.  To obtain the information it would be necessary to identify the cases and extract the information manually.  Such an exercise could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>Section 193 deals with the exemption from income tax on scholarship income.</P>
    <P>Section 484 deals with the relief for personal and corporate gifts for education in the arts.</P>
    <P>Section 764 deals with the relief for payments to Irish universities or other bodies approved by the Minister for Finance to undertake scientific research.  The person making the payment must be carrying on a trade.</P>
    <P>Section 767 deals with the relief for payments to universities and other approved bodies for research in, or teaching of, certain approved subjects. The person making the payment must be carrying on a trade or profession.</P>
    <P>Section 792 deals with the relief for covenants to universities or colleges for research.  The relief is available for personal (subject to limits) and corporate covenants.  The current estimate of the cost of corporate donations in 1997-8 is £0.7 million, in respect of 59 companies.  These figures are provisional and subject to revision.</P>

      <P>The most recent comprehensive study on air pollution in the United Kingdom is the Report of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants: &ldquo;The Quantification of the Effects of Air Pollution on Health in the United Kingdom&rdquo;. This report does not relate a high incidence of asthma to air pollution specifically caused by car emissions.  While poor air quality, including road transport pollutants, can affect the health of people with respiratory illnesses, asthma is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.  Among the environmental factors is motor vehicle pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific measures being taken to reduce vehicle emissions include continued compliance with all EU vehicle emission control directives and support for the developing EU auto oil programme to introduce more stringent vehicle emission controls and improved fuel quality.  Measures being taken by the Government as a response to urban traffic increase include the implementation of integrated and environmentally sustainable <Col N="909" /> measures such as urban traffic management strategies, the improvement of public transport and the promotion of other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas and the extension of compulsory vehicle testing to cars.  In addition, as part of our WHO commitments, an interdepartmental working party was established to develop a national environmental health action plan, NEHAP, which will look at the association between environmental factors and health in a strategic way to create a framework to address this issue.

      <P>There are no international agreements under the auspices of my Department currently being negotiated or prepared.  One agreement, the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption was signed by Ireland on 19 June 1996 but has not been ratified.  Before the convention can be ratified in Ireland, it will be necessary to give it the force of law in the State.  This will involve making changes to the adoption Acts which contain the current procedures for the regulation of foreign adoptions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>I am keeping in touch with the Eastern Health Board on this issue on an ongoing basis.  I am pleased to advise Deputy Lawlor that the most recent report received from the board, dated only last week, states that contrary to the claims being made by a number of adoption support groups, the current waiting period for applicants is now down to 12 months.  Based on inquiries made by the board, the assessment procedure takes no longer than it does in other boards.  However, as in the case referred to by the Deputy, the Eastern Health Board does require couples to participate in a group preparatory course which has proved to be hugely beneficial to all concerned and indeed other health boards are now considering incorporating the course in their assessment procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to additional resources, three additional social workers have been assigned to the boards inter-country adoption team which now consists of nine posts.  This is the only team of its kind in the country, exclusively dedicated to inter-country adoption.</P>

      <P>The preparation, Viagra, is not as yet licensed for marketing in this country.  However, I understand that an application for a marketing authorisation for the product under the centralised European procedure has been submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. As this application is currently under assessment, I am unable to say if or when such a licence will be granted.  If a licence is granted in respect of Viagra, the company may then apply to the Department for reimbursement and pricing approval in respect of the inclusion of the product of the general medical services scheme.  This application must include a &lsquo;summary of product characteristics&rsquo; and a proposed pricing structure for the product.  In the absence of an application from the company concerned and the necessary &ldquo;summary of product characteristics&rdquo;, I am not in a position to say whether this product will be reimbursable on the GMS.  The question of pricing the product will not arise until the product has been granted its marketing authorisation.  In these circumstances I am not in a position at this stage to estimate the cost of this product to the Irish market.  I am, however, keeping the position under review.</P>

      <P>My Department investigates complaints about the prescribing of controlled drugs by general practitioners in the context of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Arising from these investigations I have the power to set up a special committee of inquiry in individual cases to investigate each case in greater detail, after which inquiry I may issue a special direction prohibiting that general practitioner from prescribing certain controlled drugs.  Under the Act there is also provision for the findings of such inquiries to be relayed to the Medical Council so that it may take whatever further action it considers necessary in relation to the general practitioner.  The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 does not provide for a limit on the number of patients for whom an individual general practitioner can prescribe.  The question of taking action in relation to patient numbers does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the expert group on the establishment of a protocol for the prescribing of methadone sets out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners and community pharmacists in methadone maintenance programmes. It recommended that general practitioners should become involved by taking on responsibility for the care of opiate dependent persons who had first been stabilised at community drug treatment centres.  It also outlined the criteria necessary to ensure that methadone prescribing occurred in a controlled, responsible fashion.  Many elements of the protocol have been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone has been established.  Under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source.  However, it was only in the report of the review group of methadone treatment services, which was published in January 1998 that recommendations were made regarding limits on the number of patients that a general practitioner should treat.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is represented on the methadone protocol implementation committee which is overseeing the implementation of the report's recommendations and the college, together with the Eastern Health Board and my officials, is working closely with general practitioners who <Col N="920" /> prescribe to high numbers of patients, so that they can comply with the recommendations regarding numbers.  My officials have also had discussions with the Medical Council about actions being taken in relation to methadone prescribing.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="921" /> The management, organisation and provision of health services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in association with the voluntary hospitals and voluntary agencies in the first instance.  This necessarily involves the identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department.  Each agency, on receipt of their annual level of financial determination and as part of their preparation of an annual service plan, makes decisions with regard to the staffing levels and the skills mix it requires to provide an agreed level of service within overall financial allocation.  The issue of staffing needs is, therefore, a matter for each individual health agency, subject to the restrictions outlined above.  It is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of each agency to identify manpower requirements and to direct staffing resources to areas of particular priority.</P>
      <P>The most recent information in relation to staffing levels is the Health Service Personnel Census taken at 31 December 1996.  Information in respect of 1997 is being compiled by my Department at present.  The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the precise format required.  I assume that when the Deputy refers to child care workers, he is referring to social workers and house parents. It should be noted that while child care is an integral part of social work, not all of a social worker's time is necessarily taken with this aspect of their job.  The number of social workers of all grades is 1,078.49 and house parents of all grades is 744.6. These figures are expressed in wholetime-equivalents and relate to persons employed in the public health service throughout the eight health board regions.</P>

      <P>The services identified as necessary for child care and family support vary depending on the priority issues in each health board area.  In general they include pre school services, parenting courses, community mothers programme, family and adolescent resource centres, work with families experiencing difficulties, child psychiatric and psychology services, support for foster care groups, residential care, neighbourhood youth projects, youth homeless support services and support for and co-operation with relevant voluntary and community organisations who provide child care and family support services.  Additional funding of £8 million was provided in 1998 for the development of child care services.  The service plans prepared by the health boards outline a range of child care and <Col N="922" /> family support initiatives.  I hope to obtain additional funding in 1999 for the continued expansion of these important services.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the formulation and development of health policy.  The <Col N="923" /> management of health services, including the direct employment of staff and the utilisation of agency staff, is a matter for the individual health agencies.  The use of agency nurses is, to a significant degree, related to the unanticipated absence of nursing staff which, of itself, impacts on the continuity of care.  While each hospital is required to stay within its employment control ceiling, my Department does not apply ceilings on the use of agency nurses nor are there any plans to do so since such a measure could adversely affect management's flexibility of response in arranging nursing cover for unanticipated absences.  There is no bar to any nurse, should he or she wish, working for a nursing agency during off-duty periods. It is up to every nurse to ensure that he or she maintains a high level of service and do not work for excessive periods.  Agency nurses must be suitably qualified and registered with An Bord Altranais, and may be employed in any hospital or health agency.</P>

      <P>This development is to be funded jointly by the Eastern Health Board and my Department on the basis of a £1 for £1 arrangement. The Departnment's contribution will be a fixed amount equal to the agreed sale figure, that is, the amount due to the Eastern Health Board.  With regard to the timescale for the development of the hospital, it will be a matter for my Department and the Eastern Health Board to agree on a schedule for the phasing of the development within the development control plan, taking account of the resources available, the value of the land sale and the service priorities.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996 set out the requirements for the development of services, including the provision of additional therapy services.  This year £3 million has been provided for the development of the services of which £1.080 million was allocated to the Eastern Health Board. Health boards will decide priorities for allocating this funding in consultation with the local co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disbility services.</P>

      <P>My Department has arranged to have an examination of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost-effective way in tandem with the other community based services. I expect work to be completed on this review by mid summer.  When I have received the report, I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  The scheme was introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 in 1973 and operates under Section 61 of the 1970 Health Act which empowers a health board to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of a sick or infirm person or a dependant of such a person or a person who, but for the provision of a service for him under the section, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  I have no immediate plans to amend the regulations.  However, a number of queries have been raised recently in relation to the qualifying age for this allowance and I am arranging to have these examined further in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 239 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the policy set out in Planning for the Future the North Western Health Board is developing a community based mental health service as an alternative to the institutional service traditionally provided in psychiatric hospitals. The board's proposals for the development of services in the Donegal catchment this year include the provision of a supervised residential unit at Carndonagh for approximately 20 residents. This facility will provide accommodation for people from the Inishowen area, some of whom are in-patients at St. Conal's Hospital.  The <Col N="928" /> board then proposes to establish a similar unit at Letterkenny for people in the Letterkenny catchment area which will also result in the transfer of some patients from St. Conal's Hospital.  I understand that these initiatives will result in some ward closures at St. Conal's Hospital next year. The board has indicated that only those patients who are deemed suitable by the relevant professional staff will be accommodated in these residences or in alternative facilities for the care of older people.</P>

      <P>Ireland supports the proposed directive on the limitation of the emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations.  Many of the activities involved are already subject to integrated pollution control (IPC) licensing by the environmental protection Agency under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (No. 7 of 1992).  The main requirements of the proposed directive are already addressed by the IPC licensing system and, in some cases, activities are licensable at thresholds which are lower than those in the proposed directive.  I will introduce any new measures required to comply with this directive within the relevant timeframes.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent statement by the Commission that it intends, acting under Article 169 of the Treaty, to send a letter of formal notice to eight member states including Ireland regarding reports due in accordance with directive 91/692 in relation to the implementation of EU legislation in the water sector.  My Department has not yet received the letter of formal notice from the Commission.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/962/EEC provides for the completion of standardised report forms in respect of 14 directives in the water area.  Two of these directives 82/176/EEC and 78/176/EEC, deal respectively with discharges from the chloralkali electrolysis industry and the titanium dioxide industry.  The Commission was informed that these industries do not operate in Ireland and accordingly would not be the subject of reports.</P>
      <P>Reports are with the Commission in respect of nine other directives, while a further report conderning directive 79/923/EEC on the quality required of Shellfish waters is being finalised at present within the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, and will be supplied to the Commission shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clarification has been sought from the Commission concerning matters relating to the implementation of Directive 75/440/EEC and 79/869/EEC both of which deal with surface <Col N="938" /> water intended for the abstraction of drinking water.  Pending the Commissions response it is not possible to complete the reports for these directives.</P>
    <P>As regards drinking water quality generally, the reports previously provided to the Commission include extensive information on the situation in Ireland.  Details in this regard may be found in the EPA's report &ldquo;The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland, 1996 with a Review of the Period 1994-1996&rdquo;, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 258 and 260 together.</P>
      <P>There are a series of international agreements and Conventions relating to and including social security matters which it is open to Ireland to become party to or to ratify.</P>
      <P>Among the main such instruments is the Council of Europe's European code of Social Security. Ireland has ratified five parts of the code, namely those relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit, family benefit and survivor's benefit.  To date it has not been possible to ratify the remaining four parts dealing with medical care, employment injury benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit. However, these parts are subject to review to establish whether or not ratification has become possible.</P>
      <P>A revised code was opened for signature by member states of the Council of Europe on 5 November 1990.  To date, Ireland has not signed or ratified this revised code.</P>
      <P>Ireland has ratified a similar ILO Convention No. 102 concerning minimum standards of social security on 17 June 1968, and accepted parts of the convention relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and survivor's benefit.  A similar review procedure in relation to its unratified parts, medical care, old age benefit, employment injury benefit, family benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit applies as in the case of the European code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed provisions for the co-ordination of social security schemes throughout the European Union and the European Economic Area are <Col N="942" /> contained in Council Regulations (EEC) Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72.  These regulations provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes for employed and self-employed people and their families moving throughout the European Union and the European Economic Area.  They also cover refugees, stateless persons who are residing in an EU/EEA member state as well as members of their family (regardless of their nationality) and their survivors.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's European Convention on Social Security was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe on 14 December 1972, and was signed by Ireland on 23 February 1979, but has not yet been ratified.</P>
    <P>The convention is designed to ensure, in each ratifying country, equality of treatment in social security for nationals of other ratifying countries and for refugees and stateless persons and also to ensure that entitlement to social security benefits is maintained despite changes of residence within such countries.</P>
    <P>To date, eight of the member states of the Council of Europe viz.  Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Turkey, have ratified the convention.  All, except Turkey, are members of the European Union and, accordingly, the social security entitlements of persons moving between Ireland and those countries are already protected by the EU regulations on social security.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given to signing and ratifying a Protocol to this convention, which was opened for signature on 11 May 1994, in the con-text of any future review on whether Ireland should ratify the main convention.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's European Interim Agreements on social security were signed by Ireland on 11 December 1953 and ratified on 31 March 1954.</P>
    <P>The information sought in relation to other multilateral agreements is being provided by my Government colleagues who have primary responsibility.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently taken over responsibility for updating the legislation governing the system of registration of births deaths and marriages.  The existing legislation governing this system dates back to the 1850's and needs to be thoroughly examined and overhauled so that a more modern civil registration system can be put in place to meet current and future needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals to underpin the modernisation of the service are currently being formulated and progressed in co-operation with the Department of Health and Children the General Register Office <Col N="944" /> and other interested parties.  Legislative developments will flow directly from this process.</P>
    <P>Following the recent publication of the Pensions Board Report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;, I outlined the Government's response to the main recommendations.  Implementation of some of these proposals would involve new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts, in principle, the board's proposal for regarding a personal retirement savings account and will give consideration to these proposals as part of its next legislative cycle.  An interdepartmental working group will be set up to advance the proposals and to consult with relevant bodies including the Pensions Board.  In addition, the Government has accepted the board's recommendations in relation to access to pensions; the reduction in the vesting period from five years to two years; preservation of pre-1991 benefits; and integration of occupational pensions with social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring forward legislation amending the Pensions Act, 1990, at the next suitable opportunity to cover the proposals relating to these areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare legislation, my Department brings forward an annual Social Welfare Bill to implement budgetry changes in social welfare schemes and PRSI contributions.  It also provides for other adjustments and amendments to the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to promulgate a range of Statutory Instruments over the remainder of 1998 from among the matters specified in the following table.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme may provide a basic weekly payment to people who have little or no income.  Apart from those categories specifically excluded by the legislation, people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes, any person living in the State who satisfies a means test and who has applied for any other benefit, assistance or allowance to which he or she may be entitled, may be eligible to receive assistance under the SWA scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest.  Entitlement to SWA is determined by the health boards who administer the scheme on my behalf.</P>
      <P>There is also provision under the scheme to make an Exceptional Needs Payment, ENP.</P>
      <P>The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The person concerned can apply for assistance under the SWA scheme by contacting the community welfare officer at his local health centre. The community welfare officer will also advise the person concerned about any other entitlements that he might have.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 16 April 1996.  Payment was disallowed by a deciding officer from 28 February 1998 following an examination by a medical assessor who considered that he was capable of work.  The person concerned appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and in the context of his appeal he was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that he was capable of work.  The case was referred to an appeals officer who was of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary.  This will be arranged as soon as possible. <Col N="948" /></P>

      <P>EU Directive 96/34/EC gives effect to a framework agreement on parental leave, which was concluded at EU level by employer and trade union interests.  The framework agreement provides all employees, both men and women, with the right to at least three months unpaid leave for each child they are responsible for.</P>
      <P>The Parental Leave Bill, 1998, which is currently before the Oireachtas, provides for 14 weeks non-transferable leave for parents of children born on or before 3 June 1996.  This leave can be taken as a continuous block or, by agreement between employer and employee, as a number of broken periods.  The leave must be taken before the child is aged five and, although the leave is unpaid, employees will retain other employment rights during the period of leave.</P>
      <P>The cost of any possible parental leave benefit scheme depends to a large extent on the level of take-up.  International experience indicates that take-up levels are determined by a number of factors, including the levels of benefit available, flexibility of the leave arrangements, non-transferability of leave between parents and prevailing social attitudes.  Based on the limited information available, it is estimated that the introduction of a parental leave benefit scheme lasting for 14 weeks and giving payment rates similar to unemployment benefit could cost in the region of £26 million per year.  The options for funding such a scheme would have to be considered in the con-text of the very substantial medium-term pressures on the Social Insurance Fund which are highlighted in the national pensions policy initiative report of the Pensions Board, which I received last month.</P>

      <P>The following directives come within the categories referred to by the Deputy.  Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the co-ordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.  The deadline for implementation of this directive is 31 December 1998 but I propose to implement it before the deadline by means of primary legislation and statutory instrument; Council Directive No. 97/62/EC of 27 October 1997, adapting to technical and scientific progress Council Directive No. 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, known as the &ldquo;Habitats Directive&rdquo;.  This directive replaces Annexes I and II of the Habitats Directive and the deadline for implementation was 31 December 1997.  It is proposed to implement the directive later this month by means of a statutory instrument amending the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to my Department is as follows: the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, the body responsible for this convention is the Council of Europe and the convention was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 5 May 1989.  It is Ireland's <Col N="950" /> intention to sign and ratify this convention, but it is under amendment at present.</P>
      <P>The Unidroit Convention on the International Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects was adopted in Rome on 23 June 1995. It is my intention that this convention would be signed by Ireland.  To this end, following the report of the Law Reform Commission which recommended accession to the convention, I have agreed to take the lead in discussing the initial issues arising in relation to the question of ratification and of subsequent implementation of the convention with my Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General.  This process is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 2 November 1992.  The Council of Europe is the body responsible for this Convention which it is proposed to sign before the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>Two Acts are relevant in the context referred to by the Deputy.  National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997: the principal objective of this Act is to accord the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland autonomy in accordance with the provisions of Part II of that Act.  Work is ongoing in my Department and in the institutions so as to enable this part of the Act to be brought into force efficiently and effectively.  I expect that the commencement orders relating to this Part of the Act will be made in the course of 1999.  The other provisions in the Act either have been or will be brought into force as required and as appropriate.</P>
      <P>National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987: a commencement order is being prepared pursuant to section 27 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, which will have the effect of repealing section 21 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, which established the National Monuments Advisory Council, and section 15 of the National Monuments Act, 1954, which provided for the composition of the National Monuments Advisory Council.  The Heritage Council has effectively subsumed the functions of the former National Monuments Advisory Council.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above nominations, I am anxious that specifically local involvement be effectively accommodated, and I will shortly be meeting the farming organisations to clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>I expect the appeals committee to commence its work shortly.  It is not clear at this point when the committee will conclude its deliberations, as this will depend on the complexity of the issues arising, the time needed to dispose of each case, and the extent of additional information or investigation the committee may consider necessary.</P>

      <P>Following a recent review of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 it will not now be possible to proceed with the proposal to re-roof Glebe House and provide visitor facilities at Kilmacduagh. Unfortunately it has not proved possible to advance this project for a number of reasons, including lack of progress in certain necessary land acquisitions and an important complementary local initiative regarding ancillary works within the graveyard.  I understand that details of these works have yet to be agreed between Galway County Council and a local group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is constrained from commencing and projects which cannot be completed within the lifetime of this Operational Programme and the circumstances are such that the Kilmacduagh project could not be completed within the required time frame.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to <Col N="956" /> expend public funds on new visitor facilities for a national monument in circumstances where the question of safe and guaranteed visitor access to the monument has not been resolved.</P>
    <P>I recently met a deputation to discuss this matter. Based on the information I received from them, I would hope to be in a position to accommodate this project from funds available to me after 1999, assuming all outstanding matters regarding safe and guaranteed visitor access have been resolved.</P>

      <P>I have not investigated the circumstances surrounding the court case mentioned by the Deputy.  The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open to me to comment or to intervene in any way on the conduct or decision of any individual court case which is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  A variety of factors are taken into account by the judge in deciding on any particular case and a decision is reached by reference to the conclusions he or she has drawn after trying the case, hearing the evidence presented and assessing the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of whether the person concerned should seek a presidential pardon, the Deputy will appreciate that it is outside the scope of my official functions to give legal advice.</P>
      <P>However, I can confirm that the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993 provides remedies in cases where it is alleged that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and the existing appeal procedures have been exhausted.  I am obliged to consider petitions for presidential pardon made to me in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the Act of 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are involved in the development and operation of 14 special projects, previously called Garda community based projects, which are aimed primarily at diverting juveniles from possible involvement in crime.  In the Dublin area, projects are located in Ronanstown, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Priorswood/Darndale, the north inner city and Finglas.  Outside the Dublin area, there are projects in the Knocknaheeney, Mahon and Glen areas of Cork, in Moyross and Southill in Limerick, in Dundalk and in Ballybeg, Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projects, which are aimed at young people in the ten to 18 age group, are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and administered by advisory committees which <Col N="965" /> are multi-agency in nature.  Usually they involve gardaí, probation and welfare personnel, voluntary youth organisations, clergy and, most importantly, representatives of the local communities.</P>
    <P>Through a combination of intervention and prevention programmes which involve, for example, schools projects, sports club facilities and other, mainly recreational and developmental activities, the special projects focus on juveniles who are already involved in crime or who are likely to drop out of the eduction system prematurely, together with those in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances. The projects are also directed towards those who are unable to participate in other youth activities due to behavioural difficulties.</P>
    <P>The concept of the special projects has its origins in the increased awareness and acceptance that, whatever the relative significance, factors such as unemployment, lack of educational opportunity and various other social disadvantages contribute towards criminal activity and disorderly behaviour.</P>
    <P>Special projects are established in communities where a specific need has been identified.  The initiative generally comes from the ground up, usually from the Garda Síochána or from a statutory or voluntary agency working in the community, or from residents themselves.  While the projects do not all conform to the same structure, as they are tailor made to address the specific needs and problems in each area, they do have the same common theme running through them.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a number of similar projects, including the proposal referred to by the Deputy, are under consideration in consultation with the Garda Síochána, having regard to resources available and the need for co-ordination with other relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the correspondence mentioned, a letter has been received recently which refers to previous correspondence concerning the proposal referred to by the Deputy.  I understand that there has been contact on a number of occasions between officials of my Department and representatives of the North Inner City Drugs Task Force concerning the proposal in question.  In any event, a reply will issue to the correspondence in the near future.</P>

      <P>A person whose mother or father was born in Ireland is automatically an Irish citizen.  A person whose grandfather or grandmother, but not his or her parents, was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the Foreign Births Register, FBR, at an Irish Embassy or Consular Office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, introduced a provision whereby registration in the FBR would henceforth grant citizenship from the date of registration only.  Hence, the situation whereby the great-grandchild of an Irish-born person (&ldquo;D&rdquo;) can only register as an Irish citizen if his-her parent (&ldquo;C&rdquo;) had registered him-herself prior to the child's birth.  There are no plans at present to amend this provison in the 1986 Act.</P>

      <P>A copy of the procedures is available in the Dáil Library.  A copy is also attached for the Deputy's information.  Paragraphs 13 and 15 to 18 deal with appeals.</P>
      <P>Appeals procedures in cases dealt with under the Dublin Convention are set out in Article 7 of the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, 1997 (S.  I. No. 360 of 1997) which was made under section 22 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Procedures for processing asylum claims</P>
      <P>General</P>
      <P>1.  An application for refugee status (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;asylum&rdquo;) may be made by an applicant to an immigration officer on arrival in the State, or, if the person is already within the State to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or, if outside Dublin, to any Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> 2.  Immigration officers have been provided with written guidelines which draw attention to the statutory definition of a refugee contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, and to the prohibition on refoulement contained in section 5 of that Act.</P>
    <P>3.  Whenever it appears to an immigration officer as a result of a claim or information given by an individual that he or she might be an asylum-seeker, the following initial procedure will apply.  The immigration officer will interview the person with the purpose of eliciting sufficient information for the officer of the Department appointed under section 22(4)<i>(a)</i> of the Refugee Act, 1996, to decide if the application should be dealt with in the State or otherwise (currently the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order 1997 (S.  I. No. 360 of 1997) applies in this regard).</P>
    <P>4.  Immigration officers have been instructed that it is not necessary for an individual to use the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; or &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; in order to be an asylum-seeker.  Whether or not a person is an asylum-seeker is a matter of fact to be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case as well as guidelines which may be issued from time to time by the Department. Where necessary and possible, an interpreter shall be provided so that the individual may make his or her wishes known.  In cases of doubt, the immigration officer shall consult the Department.</P>
    <P>Admissibility</P>
    <P>5.  An asylum seeker may be granted or refused leave to land in accordance with normal immigration criteria as the individual circumstances warrant.  However, any refusal of leave to land in such circumstances will have suspensive effect, and such a person will not be removed from the State, until either&mdash;</P>
    <P>it is determined that the individual is not in fact seeking asylum in the State, or a final decision has been made under the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order that the application should be dealt with in another convention country, or</P>
    <P>It is decided that the application is manifestly unfounded, or</P>
    <P>the application has been deemed to be abandoned, or</P>
    <P>the application has been examined substantively in the State and a final decision reached on it.</P>
    <P>Substantive consideration</P>
    <P>6.  An asylum application for which the State has responsibility will be examined by reference to the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  The following paragraphs set out the <Col N="971" /> procedure by which that examination will take place.</P>
    <P>7.  The applicant will be given an opportunity to submit his or her case to the Department and to contact the UNHCR Representative and/or a local representative of his or her choice.  The applicant will be informed of the procedure to be followed and of these rights, where possible in a language which he or she understands.</P>
    <P>8.  The applicant will be interviewed by a person appointed by the Minister or by an immigration officer.  Where necessary and possible, the interview will be conducted with the aid of an interpreter.  The applicant may be accompanied at the interview by a representative, who will, however, refrain from answering questions for the applicant or intervening in any way in the conduct of the interview.  The representative will be given an opportunity at the end of the interview to make briefly any points which are considered necessary.</P>
    <P>9.  At any point before, or up to five working days after, the interview the applicant or his or her representative may make written representations relating to the case.</P>
    <P>10.  A person appointed by the Minister will assess the case having regard to the interview, the report of the interview, to any written representations duly submitted and to such information as may be obtained from UNHCR or other internationally reliable sources.  Such person will make a recommendation as to whether refugee status should be granted or refused.</P>
    <P>11.  A person duly authorised by the Minister will make a decision based on the information made available during the process described above.  The applicant will be notified by registered post of the decision and of the reasons for it, and (if the decision is negative) of the right to appeal the decision within 14 days of the notification being sent, setting out the grounds on which the appeal is based.  The applicant in his or her notice of appeal shall specify if an oral hearing is required. </P>
    <P>Manifestly unfounded cases: accelerated procedure</P>
    <P>12.  Where at any time following receipt of an application any of the circumstances set out at paragraph 14 below emerges, a person duly authorised by the Minister may decide to terminate further examination of the case on the grounds that it is manifestly unfounded and to refuse the application for refugee status accordingly.  The applicant will be notified by registered post of <Col N="972" /> the decision and of the reasons for it, and of the right to appeal the decision within seven working days of the notification being sent, setting out the grounds on which the appeal is based.  UNHCR will also be notified of each such decision and provided with a copy of any appeal submissions made.</P>
    <P>13.  (a) The appeal will be determined by An Appeals Authority, a person independent of the Minister and the Department with not less than seven years' practice as a solicitor or barrister appointed by the Minister for this purpose (more than one such person may be appointed).  The Appeals Authority will be provided with all of the papers available in the case and with such submissions as may be made by or on behalf of the applicant in connection with the appeal.  The Appeals Authority will make a determination based on the papers only.  Where UNHCR has made no observations in the case within seven working days of the decision under appeal, it will be assumed that no observations are being offered.</P>
    <P>(b) The Appeals Authority will make a recommendation to the Minister as to whether the original determination should stand or whether the application should be considered substantively.</P>
    <P>(c) A duly authorised officer of the Department will make a decision based on the recommendation of the Appeals Authority, but subject to considerations of national security or public policy (<i>ordre publique</i>).</P>
    <P>(d) If the appeal is decided in favour of the applicant, the applicant will be notified of the decision and processing of the application will resume.  Otherwise the applicant will be notified of the decision and the provisions of paragraph 21 below will have effect.</P>
    <P>14.  The grounds on which it may be determined that an application is manifestly unfounded are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) it does not show on its face any grounds for the contention that the applicant is a refugee,</P>
    <P>(b) the applicant gave clearly insufficient details or evidence to substantiate the application,</P>
    <P>(c) the applicant's reason for leaving or not returning to his or her country of nationality does not relate to a fear of persecution,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> (d) the applicant did not reveal, following the making of the application, that he or she was travelling under a false identity or was in possession of false or forged identity documents and did not have reasonable cause for not so revealing,</P>
    <P>(e) the applicant, without reasonable cause, made deliberately false or misleading representations of a material or substantial nature in relation to the application,</P>
    <P>(f) the applicant, without reasonable cause and in bad faith, destroyed identity documents, withheld relevant information or otherwise deliberately obstructed the investigation of the application,</P>
    <P>(g) the applicant deliberately failed to reveal that he or she had lodged a prior application for asylum in another country,</P>
    <P>(h) the applicant submitted the application for the sole purpose of avoiding removal from the State,</P>
    <P>(i) the applicant has already made an application for a declaration or an application for recognition as a refugee in a state party to the Geneva Convention, and the application was properly considered and rejected and the applicant has failed to show a material change of circumstances,</P>
    <P>(j) the applicant is a national of or has a right of residence in a state party to the Geneva Convention in respect of which the applicant has failed to adduce evidence of persecution,</P>
    <P>(k) the applicant has, after making the application, without reasonable cause, left the State without leave or permission or has not replied to communications, or</P>
    <P>(l) the applicant has already been recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention by a state other than the State, has been granted asylum in that state and his or her reason for leaving or not returning to that state does not relate to a fear of persecution in that state.</P>
    <P>Appeals</P>
    <P>15.  Where an appeal is made within the specified time against a decision (other than in manifestly unfounded cases or in cases deemed to be abandoned (see paragraph 20)) to refuse refugee status, the applicant will be supplied with all of the material (other than material which has been supplied to the Department on the basis that <Col N="974" /> it will not be disclosed further) on which the decision was based.  The appeal will be determined by an Appeals Authority, a person independent of the Minister and the Department with at least ten years' practice as a solicitor or barrister appointed by the Minister for this purpose (more than one such person may be appointed).  The Appeals Authority will be provided with all of the information provided to the applicant and with such submissions as may be made by or on behalf of the applicant in connection with the appeal.  The Appeals Authority will make a decision based on the papers only or, where the applicant has so requested, following an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>16.  Where an applicant fails to attend at an appeal hearing, having requested and being granted an oral hearing and having been duly informed of the date thereof, the appeal shall be considered on the basis of written documentation already available to the Appeals Authority.</P>
    <P>17.  The Appeals Authority will make a recommendation to the Minister as to whether refugee status should be granted.</P>
    <P>18.  A duly authorised officer of the Department will make a final decision on refugee status on behalf of the Minister based on the recommendations of the Appeals Authority, but subject to considerations of national security or public policy <i>(ordre publique).</i></P>
    <P>Grant of status</P>
    <P>19.  Where refugee status is granted, the applicant will be notified accordingly and will be provided with documentation confirming his or her status and the nature and extent of his or her rights under the 1951 Convention and associated Protocol.</P>
    <P>Abandoned cases</P>
    <P>20.  Where an applicant fails to attend at an interview or is otherwise uncontactable without good and sufficient reason his or her case will be considered to be abandoned. A notice to this effect will be sent to the applicant at his or her last known address by registered post.  If the applicant subsequently comes to the attention of the authorities he or she will be considered to be an illegal immigrant and will be dealt with in accordance with immigration (nonasylum) rules.</P>
    <P>Refusal</P>
    <P>21.  Where refugee status is either refused at first instance and not appealed within the time specified, or is refused following an appeal, the applicant will be invited to leave the State voluntarily and informed that failure to do so within 14 days may result in a recommendation being made to <Col N="975" /> the Minister that a deportation order should be made in respect of him or her.</P>
    <P>Temporary leave to remain</P>
    <P>22.  The above procedures offer to applicants who do not come within the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, sufficient opportunities to make submissions to the Minister as to whether there are special reasons why leave should be granted to them to remain temporarily in the State.  A decision in any such case remains at the absolute discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Co-operation with the UNHCR</P>
    <P>23.  The UNHCR representative will be notified of the making of each application.  The UNHCR representative may attend any interview or hearing in connection with the above proceedings, and may have access to the papers relating to any particular case at any stage during the processing of an application. Where the UNHCR representative considers it appropriate, he or she may make unsolicited representations relating to any case or group of cases; such representations will be taken into account in arriving at a decision.</P>
    <P>24.  The Department undertakes to operate these procedures in a spirit of co-operation with the UNHCR with a view to ensuring that no person deserving of protection in the State is refused it.</P>

      <P>Under our legal system the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence, assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused, etc.  Under the Constitution, judges are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open to the Executive to intervene in such matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to an obligation to consider rehabilitation in the sentencing of young offenders, section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, is relevant in that it requires the judge to be satisfied that no other method of dealing with the case is suitable prior to imposing a sentence of detention in St. Patrick's Institution.  This section provides that:</P>
      <P>where a person who is less than seventeen but not less than sixteen years of age is convicted of an offence for which he would, if he were not less than seventeen years of age, be liable to be sentenced to a term of penal servitude or imprisonment, and the Court considers that none of the other methods in which the case may be legally dealt with is suitable he may be sentenced to be detained in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the annual reports of the Garda Commissioner, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The most recent report published is in respect of 1996.  In that report, detailed crime statistics are presented, including types of indictable <Col N="978" /> offences divided into groups and presented in detail to show the number of offences recorded, the results of proceedings taken and the age and gender of persons who have been convicted.</P>
      <P>The specific information sought by the Deputy, which does not refer to any particular year, is not available in any event, in that the ages of offenders are known only in respect of offences which have been detected.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities, however, that the following table shows the proportions of detected indictable offences recorded in 1996 in respect of which at least one offender is recorded as being in the age groups mentioned.</P>

      <P>Most of our prisons and places of detention are relatively drug free.  The vast majority of drug addicted offenders are in institutions in the Dublin area, in particular, in Mountjoy Prison.  Treatment facilities are available there.</P>
      <P>The drug treatment facility in Mountjoy has been in operation since July 1996 at the prison's health care unit.  This facility provides chemical detoxification and a therapy programme.  This unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State and it is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the Mountjoy drug treatment facility and the drug free unit at the training unit and is examining the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available for such prisoners. The intention would be to have similar facilities available to all the closed institutions once the need for them has been established.</P>
      <P>Progress in this area is hampered, however, by the present overcrowding problem in our prisons but, as the Deputy will know, I am addressing this problem vigorously.</P>

      <P>The most recently available statistics indicate that 65 offenders sentenced to life imprisonment are currently at liberty.  In practice, most such offenders were granted renewable temporary release whereby, unless the conditions of the release are breached, there is no requirement to return to prison except to renew the temporary release at specified intervals.</P>
      <P>Offenders on renewable temporary release must be of good behaviour.  Other conditions could include supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service, reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached, in which event the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for decision by the court as to whether a pre-sentence report should be provided or not.  Such reports are normally supplied by the Probation and Welfare Service and the introduction of mandatory pre-sentence reports would have obvious resource and other implications for that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 and 310 together.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the number of cases referred for community service orders was 1,910 and the total number of orders not made was 524.  In the following year 1997, there were 1,450 cases referred for community service orders but no orders were made in 283 cases.</P>
      <P>In respect of the number of community service orders imposed in the years 1996 and 1997 respectively, I wish to inform the Deputy that in 1996 the total number of community service orders made was 1,386, of which prosecutions initiated for non-compliance was 173.  In respect of the following year 1997, the number of orders made was 1,167 and the total number of prosecutions initiated for non-compliance was 140.</P>
      <P>In respect of the outcome in the non-compliance cases, this information is not readily available. However, I can assure the Deputy in each case where non-compliance occurs it is followed through in the courts generally, resulting in prison sentences or long-term remands.</P>
      <P>My Department's Probation and Welfare Service has in the early years attempted to compile this information, but due to the lack of resources the compiling of this type of statistic was not given priority.  I am now initiating an independent research project on the operation and effectiveness of community service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regards to the work done by those on community service, it would be very lengthy to list every project undertaken for any part of 1996 and 1997, and the cost for detailing every project could not be justified.  However, the range of projects around the country follows a broadly similar pattern and covers the types of work which would <Col N="981" /> benefit the community which would not otherwise be done: cleaning, minor restoration and renovation and painting of community premises, voluntary social service centres and old folks homes; ground maintenance, rotovation and clearance of neglected areas in hostels; cleaning of headstones; tidying old graveyards; removal of graffiti; painting murals on prominent walls in disadvantaged communities; paper recycling and prelog production for senior citizens.</P>

      <P>With regard to a personal assistant for the pupil my Department's capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resources available and the level of competing demand across the special needs area. Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated to special schools and special classes which cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provisions across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources, including child care support, are deployed as effectively as possible.  Please be assured that the needs of the child you referred to will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>I have recently authorised the planning and building unit of my Department to commence architectural planning for an extension at the school to which the Deputy refers.  The extension will take account of the needs of the physically disabled.  In the meantime, my Department's technical advisers have been asked to explore the immediate disabled access needs for September 1998 enrolment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 334, 335 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties to which the Deputy refers.  The question of escorts for children with special needs travelling to special schools and special classes was one of the issues considered by the School Transport Review Committee.</P>
      <P>The committee's report was presented to my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, Minister of State, in September of last year.  The report was subsequently circulated to all relevant parties with an invitation to submit their views on the report's conclusions.  I understand that the Minister of State has since had discussions with a number of groups and that the issue of provision for special needs pupils, including the question of escorts for such pupils, has been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration will be given to the views put forward by interested parties as part of the process <Col N="990" /> of arriving at decisions on the future operation of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>Since 1995, an annual allocation of £150,000 has been provided to fund the pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.</P>
    <P>All applications for support under the scheme were carefully considered in my Department.  It was decided that the pilot phase should focus on: facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools for children with physical disabilities; and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visuallyimpaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that £2 million would be required to extend the escort scheme to all special services.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the issues which he raises will be considered in the context of any proposed expansion of the escort scheme.</P>

The importance of such equipment to special needs children has been given particular recognition under the Schools IT 2000 Initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this initiative, each ordinary primary <Col N="991" /> school is receiving a basic grant of £2,000 together with a grant of £5 per pupil.</P>
    <P>Each special school is receiving a basic grant of £3,000 together with a grant of £20 per pupil.</P>
    <P>Each ordinary primary school which has a special class or classes is receiving a grant of £1,500 on top of the basic grant of £2,000.  The children attending the special classes also attract a grant of £20 per pupil.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above funding, I have allocted a sum of £250,000 to supplement the special resources already provided to meet the special equipment needs of individual children with disabilities, including those attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined give concrete expression to my commitment to ensuring that the equipment needs of special needs children are adequately catered for within the education system.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced in November that public service pensioners who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> should benefit from those pay deals on a <Col N="995" /> parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions (or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent).</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government decision, an increase of 2 per cent in their pensions has already been paid to teachers who retired before 1 July 1994 &mdash; the earliest commencement date in the case of teachers of the PCW restructuring pay deals.</P>
      <P>The final element of the restructuring pay deals, that concerning in-school management, has only recently been agreed.  Arrangements are now being made to pay the arrears of pension and retirement gratuity to eligible pensioners who retired after 1 July 1994 and to pay the balance, if any, due to eligible pensioners who retired prior to that date.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed before September 1998.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement provides for increases in the salary and allowances of teachers and provides for the introduction of new allowances.  In accordance with long-standing practice, the benefit of the increases in salary will be reflected, on a parity basis, in the pensions of all retired teachers and the benefit of the allowances will be reflected, on a parity basis, in the pensions of teachers who held those allowances during service. The position is, therefore, that any teacher who receives, or has received, an increase in pay arising from an allowance will also receive the benefit of that allowance in his or her pension, on a full parity basis.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since them.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project, schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the scheme have been allocated extra staffing resources to enable them to operate within a maximum class size of 15 pupils in all junior classes.  In line with the agreement referred to above, these staffing allocations are also determined by reference to the schools' enrolments at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>However, there is an arrangement in place whereby schools may contact my Department if their projected entrolments are to increase for the forthcoming school year.  In such situations, my Department will re-examine the schools' staffing needs based on the projected enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in question has submitted projected enrolments for the forthcoming school year.  A member of my Department's inspectorate recently visited the school to assess its overall needs.  The position regarding staffing will be reviewed following receipt of the inspector's report. <Col N="999" /></P>

      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made to provide a school bus service for pupils from Lengarra, Danesrath and Knocktopher, County Kilkenny, who attend school in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, in view of the fact that the service comes within one mile of Danesrath but is full at this point; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The children to whom the Deputy refers reside in a closed school area, and under the terms of the scheme, are eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation.  However, as they are attending another school, the most that can be offered is concessionary fare-paying transport on the existing service.</P>
      <P>Fare-paying tickets may only be issued where there is accommodation available after all eligible children have been catered for, and no additional State cost is involved by way of altering or extending the route of a service, or providing an additional or larger bus.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I regret it would not be open to my Department to provide a bus service for these pupils as requested.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment of Churchill national school on 30 September 1997 was 53 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one teacher for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>I note from the school authorities that the projected September 1998 enrolment for the school is 62.  If the school is unable to organise its classes within maximum class size guidelines in September 1998, the managerial authorities of the school should contact my Department directly in the matter.</P>

      <P>The management of Drumphea national school has applied to my Department for grant assistance towards the cost of providing a new school building.</P>
      <P>A member of my Department's architectural staff has examined the existing school structure and recently furnished his report in the matter. This report is currently under examination in my Department's building unit.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.

      <P>I am aware that pupil numbers have increased in Virginia vocational school in the last few years.  Applications have been received from County Cavan Vocational Education Committee for additional temporary accommodation to meet immediate needs and for permanent accommodation in respect of the school.  These applications are under consideration in my Department at present and will be processed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I can confirm also that, as indicated by the Deputy, the VEC has been approached by the Virginia Show Society with an offer of accommodation for school use.  I understand that the committee is appointing an architect to examine and report on the suitability of the building for conversion to classrooms.</P>
