    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the European Conference, was held in London on 12 March and was attended by the Heads of State or Government and Foreign Affairs Ministers, of the 15 member states of the Union and 11 European States aspiring to accede to the Union.  As I indicated in a reply to a question on the conference on 24 February, this conference was not part of the enlargement process, but was complementary to it.  The accession process, involving all ten central and eastern European applicants and Cyprus, will commence on 30 March.  Accession negotiations, with the five most advanced central and eastern European applicants &mdash; Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia, together with Cyprus, will open the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Conference in London provided an ideal forum for the discussion of issues which are of concern to all the participants, namely, drugs, crime and the environment.  At the conference, <Col N="1270" /> I indicated Ireland's strong support for efforts at international and European level to control the trade in illicit drugs.</P>
    <P>I had a brief meeting with Prime Minister Buzek of Poland, at which we discussed Poland's application for membership of the European Union.  I reiterated at that meeting, Ireland's strong support for the enlargement of the European Union and for Poland's application.  I also had a meeting with Prime Minister Blair, which is the subject of a separate question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that enlargement, which is supported by this side of the House, will mean changes in the funding available to Ireland?  To ensure that Ireland continues to secure funding from Europe, does he agree we should develop real, devolved local government and, as this is so important, will he explain why he has removed responsibility for the devolution committee from his Department?  Without devolution there is no possibility of Ireland retaining grants for marginalised and disadvantaged areas.  Commissioner Wulf-Mathies stated that devolution was the only means through which Ireland could continue to secure good grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Conference between the 15 members of the European Union and the 11 applicant states did not discuss the devolution committee, which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, or Agenda 2000, which will be the subject of many other questions.  I do not know what answer I can give that would be relevant to the initial question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there no discussion at the meeting about the impact of enlargement on existing member states?  It will mean that funding will have to be shared with new member states and in future Ireland will not be able to depend on so much grant aid from Europe.  How does the Taoiseach propose to ensure that marginalised areas of this country will continue to receive assistance?  Commissioner Wulf-Mathies said one of the means of securing such assistance is through devolution.  The Taoiseach appears to be ignoring the Commissioner's advice by devolving control of the devolution committee to a lesser Department.  What proposals does he have to maintain Ireland's status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Enlargement was not discussed at the meeting.  Discussions on enlargement are due to commence on 30 March and most Members of the House support enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussions on enlargement and Agenda 2000, funding will have to be discussed. With regard to devolution, the Government is anxious to achieve reform of the local government system.  Responsibility for the devolution committee was transferred to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to <Col N="1271" /> achieve a proper and adequate review of local government and to ensure that whatever structures we have in the ongoing Agenda 2000 negotiations will be reflected in an adequate way in the resources we will have after the transition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have a meeting with Chancellor Kohl with regard to duty free sales?  If not, why did he not take the opportunity to raise the issue with the Chancellor and with other Heads of State who oppose its retention?  Two other Ministers raised the issue at Council meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Conference was a one day meeting starting mid-morning and ending early evening.  I dealt with the items discussed in my initial reply.  Apart from the bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Bouzek of Poland and Prime Minister Blair, I had no other meetings on any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not raise the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the size of the European budget discussed?  Was it raised by the Taoiseach or any other state represented at the conference?  A budget of 1.27 per cent of European GDP is grossly inadequate to fund the development necessary in applicant countries when they become members or even to support them in preparing for membership.  As long as the budget remains that size, cuts in Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds and Common Agricultural Policy funding are inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a conference of member states of the European Union and prospective new members.  It was suggested at the December European Council that such a meeting should be held.  As it was not the normal European Council; the normal lunches and bilateral meetings were not held.  I do not see the figure of 1.27 per cent changing.  This will be the figure used in the next round up to 2006.  It is unlikely that many of the applicant countries will conclude accession agreements before then.  The enlargement process is unlikely to change the financial perspective in a severe way in the intervening period, although it will in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the European Conference was called largely to lessen the sense of hurt felt by the Government of Turkey following the decisions taken prior to Christmas.  It subsequently declined to accept an invitation to attend and participate in the conference which was convened largely for its benefit and that of the five most advanced applicant countries.  Did the Taoiseach make an intervention on the issue of eventual Turkish membership of the European Union?  What is the Government's attitude on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1272" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the reason the meeting was called originally.  When agreement could not be reached in December to include Turkey, the meeting was seen as a way of mending ways and providing for the involvement of Turkey.  I expressed my disappointment that it could not find its way to attend.  It was a source of grave disappointment to all member states as well as the other prospective member states.  It is the position of the European Union that we should continue to try under the British and future Presidencies to maintain contacts to find a settlement.  We indicated at the November and December European Councils that we would like to see Turkey join on the basis that it would sign up to the normal rules and regulations, particularly those relating to human rights.  I restated this.  Notwithstanding this, in the short and medium term it is in the interests of the cohesion of the European Union that a solution should be found.  Otherwise, we will be in an unsatisfactory position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the 15 member states make a statement at the conference in relation to Kosovo?  If so, what were the main points?  Perhaps he could clarify if the other 11 states who are applying to join the European Union indicated support or otherwise for that statement.  Is it intended to take the points made in that statement to the United Nations to see if action can be taken at that level on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A long statement was issued which was discussed and supported by the Foreign Affairs Ministers.  The Presidency and a number of countries are directly involved in trying to make progress in this matter.  The UN is already involved.  I had an opportunity last week to report on the contents of that declaration when I met President Clinton in the United States.  It is hoped that progress can be made but the situation remains serious.  There is a lot of non co-operation by the authorities on what the European Union would like to see happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he had a bilateral meeting with the Polish Prime Minister.  Was that at the Taoiseach's instigation?  Apart from telling him that he supported his application for enlargement, did the Taoiseach discuss any new initiatives on drug trafficking as Poland is one of the major countries where man-made drugs are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting was held at Prime Minister Buzek's request.  We discussed that issue during our discussion of the meeting's agenda.  He outlined to me his economic reforms and how he hoped his country could be integrated into the European Union as quickly as possible.  He outlined his programme of privatisation, his hopes for radical economic reform and his efforts to give a better deal to the citizens.  He was a Solidarity <Col N="1273" /> leader in the early 1970s and he is anxious to follow the practices of social cohesion and to follow the labour laws.  We had a discussion on some of those issues and how they affect his country.  He was at pains to tell me and the other leaders he met during the day and over the past number of months that he is anxious to be one of the first countries to avail of a treaty of accession as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the secular republic of Turkey came into existence around the same time as the USSR and that western Europe included Turkey in the European family more as a means of containment of the Soviet empire than as an expression of a recognition of that country's European identity, did any member state at the conference which the Taoiseach attended, including the Irish Government, indicate if they were fully committed to allowing Turkey to become a full member of the European Union, notwithstanding the civil rights abuses which exist not just in Turkey but in countries such as Slovakia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not happen at the European Conference.  However, as I said earlier, there were long evening meetings and debates which lasted several hours at the European Council in November and December to see if it would be included on the list.  All the member states want to see this issue resolved.  However, it will not be possible to resolve it in the short term because an electoral contest must take place. They are unlikely to respond to any of the overtures from the Presidency or from other countries before that election.  That is part of the reason there has not been quick progress on that issue.  I attended that Council meeting and heard the views of representatives of countries that are much closer to that situation than we are and have been involved in it for a much longer period. Notwithstanding the difficulties, people are of the view it has not complied with the relevant terms. I met the Prime Minister of Turkey at the November meeting.  However, there are some concerns about Turkey joining the community in the shorter term.  There are issues other than the civil rights one that are of concern, but civil rights is the main concern and that was stressed strongly to them at the two meetings in November and December at which this matter was discussed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 22, inclusive, and 62 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>My visit to Canada and Washington for St. Patrick's Day was very positive and I hope will help to progress the negotiations towards agreement.  I will circulate the list of people who accompanied me on this trip with my answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visit to Toronto began on 13 March with the Ireland Fund of Canada lunch at the Metro Convention Centre, where I took the opportunity to thank the fund for its continuing efforts to advance peace, reconciliation and socio-economic development in all parts of Ireland.  I set out the Irish Government's position and expectations in regard to the multi-party negotiations on Northern Ireland and expressed the Irish Government's appreciation for the tremendous contribution of General John de Chastelain as, <i>inter alia</i>, one of the independent chairmen of the peace talks. That evening I attended a dinner hosted by the Honourable Hilary Weston, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, who is also the first Irish born Lieutenant Governor of the Province and a founder of the Ireland Fund of Canada.  While at the Apostles of Ireland of Toronto breakfast on the Saturday morning, I had the opportunity to meet a wide range of business people and industrialists, including Mr. Matthew Barrett, Chairman of the Bank of Montreal, and to speak on the multi-party negotiations and on our hopes for securing <Col N="1276" /> a settlement in the historical context of the commemoration of the 1798 Rebellion and of the ideals of the United Irishmen.  That evening, I attended the Grand Marshall's Ball at the Hilton Hotel, where I acknowledged and welcomed the important economic and cultural relationship that exists between Ireland and Canada and welcomed the appointment of Mr. Ted McConnell as Honorary Consul General of Ireland in Toronto. Before departing for Washington I attended the 10th Anniversary St. Patrick's Day parade in Toronto.</P>
    <P>While in Washington I took the opportunity to visit a Co-operation North conference of young political leaders from Ireland, North and South, before meeting with Senator Kennedy on Capitol Hill.  In my meeting with Senator Kennedy, I thanked him for his dedication and support for the peace process and we discussed recent developments.  I also had lunch with the Washington Post editorial board and took the opportunity to give a number of television interviews.  I attended the American Ireland Fund Dinner on Monday night where I again expressed our appreciation of the significant support given by the fund and paid tribute to the work of all the people connected with the fund.  I also outlined the position and our hopes in regard to the multi-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>On St. Patrick's Day I met President Clinton in the morning at the White House and discussed recent developments and the outlook for the endgame negotiations, before presenting him with shamrock and thanking him for his tremendous contribution in supporting and encouraging the peace process.  I attended a lunch hosted by Speaker Gingrich which was attended by President Clinton, Dr. Mo Mowlam and by leaders of, or spokespersons for, all the Northern Ireland political parties engaged in the negotiations.  At that lunch I took the opportunity to pay tribute to the leaders of the parties who, despite many difficulties and uncertainties, had stuck with the talks process over the months.  That evening I returned to the White House for a reception hosted by President Clinton where again I spoke of our hopes for the peace process and of the intertwined histories of our countries.  Following this, I attended a reception at the Ambassador's residence.  Before returning to Ireland on 18 March, I also had the opportunity to meet over breakfast with the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board.  This was my first opportunity, as Taoiseach, to meet with the members of the board and the discussion focused primarily on developments in the peace process, but particularly on the requirements to underpin Ireland's economic success into the next millennium.  I took this opportunity to pay tribute to the board members for a most stimulating and thought provoking session, which will be followed up actively.</P>
    <P>While in Washington I met bilaterally and informally with many of the leaders and representatives of Northern Ireland parties.  I urged them to seize the opportunity for peace and to move forward from their stated positions to make the <Col N="1277" /> necessary compromises to ensure a settlement can be reached by Easter.  This is a message which was strongly supported by President Clinton, who stressed the importance of leadership and of being strong enough to make principled compromise and made the important point that no one would be the loser if agreement is reached.  He also pointed to lessons from the engagement of former enemies in the Middle East peace process. While in Washington, President Clinton acknowledged that Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith would be stepping down in July and I would like to take this opportunity to express again, as I did already in Washington to President Clinton and publicly, my personal appreciation and the gratitude of this House for the significant contribution made by Ambassador Kennedy Smith to the search for peace.</P>
    <P>Throughout my visit to the US, I took the opportunity to express our continued appreciation of the deep and enduring bond that exists between our two countries, and the dynamic role played by the US in helping us on the road to achieving a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.  I also expressed our sincere gratitude for the tremendous skill, patience and wisdom shown by Senator George Mitchell in steering this complex and often frustrating process.  With regard to a possible invitation to President Clinton to visit Ireland, any such visit would, in accordance with normal practice, be announced in parallel at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in London on 12 March in the margins of the EU summit where we discussed the rate of progress in the talks over the past month.  We are united in our determination to drive this process forward and believe that all the parties can meet our shared objectives if they have the courage and political will to make the necessary compromises.  I am bending all my energies towards reaching an agreement by Easter, and, regarding any plans for direct personal involvement in the talks, I will not, of course, fail to take any step I judge to be potentially effective.  At the meeting, and in subsequent contacts with Prime Minister Blair, we agreed we should focus on reaching agreement in time for the Easter deadline and assessed the detailed work required to be done to ensure that goal is achieved.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Joint Framework Document, the Government remains committed to the positions set out in it as our best judgment of where agreement might lie, a view shared with the British Government, as declared in the joint paper on strand two tabled by the two Governments in London on 23 February.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, as I stated in the House, I will be anxious to keep the House informed about all parts of any agreement, including the constitutional aspects, when it is possible to do so.  Ultimately, the people will make the decision on any changes to the Constitution, following the enactment of any constitutional amendment Bill by the <Col N="1278" /> Oireachtas and, accordingly, it is my intention that the House should be informed in plenty of time.  As I stated, I discussed certain priorities, including Articles 2 and 3, with Deputies who support the Government, including Deputy Blaney.  As I said then, and have said publicly many times, any proposed changes to Articles 2 and 3 would be made in the context of balanced constitutional change and of a satisfactory overall agreement, and only in that context.</P>

      <P>I feel positively weary having listened to the Taoiseach's round of engagements and commend him on his resilience and stamina and the fact he still has his figure after all those receptions and meetings with the apostles.  Were all 12 apostles at the meeting or was one missing?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also pay tribute to Mrs. Kennedy Smith, the US ambassador, on her time in Ireland.  She has the longest record of attendance here as an ambassador and has been significantly involved in many ways in the peace process.  On Question No. 12, did the Taoiseach share with Prime Minister Blair the terms of the written agreement which Deputy Blaney says he has with the Taoiseach?  In an article on 12 March the Deputy stated he had a written agreement dated 24 June 1997.  Did the Taoiseach indicate to the Prime Minister what was in the agreement and will he indicate to the House what is in it?  In keeping with the spirit of consensus across the House on Northern Ireland issues, does the Taoiseach think the Opposition should also be privy to the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her kind remarks.  Any changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution will be in terms of an overall settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney stated in a newspaper article on 12 March he had a signed agreement dated 24 June 1997 to the effect that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution would not be amended until there was a fully agreed overall settlement of the national question.  Does Deputy Blaney have such a signed agreement and does it in any way tie the hands of the Taoiseach or the negotiators in regard to Articles 2 and 3?  If there is nothing to hide then the Taoiseach should place the agreement in the Library so that we all can see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I exchange correspondence with Deputies and it is not necessary to lay these before the House.  On what Deputy Blaney stated, I did not read the article but I heard the content of it.  My understanding with him relates to the programme for Government.  The understanding of the House is that no one is talking about changing anything unless it is in the context of an overall settlement.  That is the position. <Col N="1279" />  This is precisely what I said at my meeting with Deputy Blaney, the minutes of which I countersigned with him.  I restated that constitutional change would occur only in the context of an overall settlement dealing with all aspects in Northern Ireland.  That does not compromise anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is confirming that there is a written agreement between him and Deputy Blaney which he countersigned.  If there is such a document perhaps the Taoiseach will let us see it so that there can be no confusion about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the willingness of this House and, subsequently, of the people of this State to agree to an amendment of Articles 2 and 3 is a litmus test of our willingness to have a long-term peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland?  Equally, there is a need for others to change and amend their positions.  For example, there is a need for Unionists to accept North-South bodies and for Nationalists in Northern Ireland to accept an internal assembly.  This is necessary if an agreement is to be reached and, therefore, it is vital that all Members of the House, and the people of the State, be persuaded that an amendment of Articles 2 and 3 is essential to a balanced agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  As I stated on numerous occasions at Question Time, we need to move away from talking to deciding the many matters which must be decided.  In the context of an overall settlement the key issues are an assembly in Northern Ireland, a body where the parties in the North can work together and the North-South bodies which are being discussed today.  We must find a way of making these executive bodies meaningful and ensure they function properly. We have long indicated our acceptance of constitutional change.  There are also the changes to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, by way of an amendment to section 75 or a re-enactment of the legislation.  All these matters must be dealt with alongside the equality agenda which is extremely important to Nationalists.  There is also the important issue of policing on which some progress has been made and the other confidence building issues which have been on the agenda for some time.  There is also the issue of prisoners which cannot be left out of the final settlement. These are the key issues which must be dealt with and they all form part of the overall settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> It is never a difficulty in this House but I stress again that one cannot pick elements of the agreement and read them in isolation while ignoring other elements.  They are all part of the overall agreement.  As someone who has been deeply involved in the negotiations, my estimation is that if one matter falls they all fall.  All are part of a substantive, comprehensive agenda and all have to be agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In the Taoiseach's discussions with Mr. Blair and the various parties in the United States did he cover the timetable for the referenda which will occur in this State arising from the Northern Ireland talks and the Amsterdam Treaty?  Does he agree it would be wrong to hold the referenda on these two vital issues on the same day because that would not allow for a proper, democratic debate on either matter, both in the Dáil and among the population?  Does he therefore agree that to allow for a proper discussion on these two complex issues the referenda must be held on different days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss that with either President Clinton or the Prime Minister Mr. Blair because it is a matter for ourselves.  In terms of how things will progress one is certain only that one is uncertain.  The Amsterdam Treaty referendum will probably be held on 22 May &mdash; that has not been completely finalised but that date is likely.  It is too early to say what will happen to any possible referendum on Northern Ireland.  I hope it will be held in May but I cannot be certain about that.</P>
      <P>I noted the Deputy's remark about not holding both referenda on one day but some people have suggested that it would be a good idea to hold them together.  No decision has been made and it will not arise until we see how things develop between now and Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a contrary view to that expressed in earlier comments.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas?  Is it the Government's aim to reintegrate <Col N="1281" /> the national territory, as has been its stated purpose for many years?  Given that the 1937 Constitution's claim of right to the island is not enforced, and that its non-enforcement is explicitly stated in Article 3 of that Constitution, does the Taoiseach recognise that it is the British claim which is enforced by both political and military means?  What changes, therefore, has the Government proposed in British legislation, including the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 and the Northern Ireland (Constitution) Act, 1973, to remove the undemocratic veto which the British Government has exercised in this island, where a minority has the opportunity to determine the overall political make-up?  Having heard some recent comments, specifically during the by-election campaigns &mdash; I was in Limerick when the Taoiseach was there &mdash; I am strongly of the view that any dilution or diminution of Irish sovereignty by amending Articles 2 and 3 by the insertion of what is spuriously referred to as a claim of consent, basically a unionist veto, will be vigorously opposed by nationalist opinion, not only on this island but internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not talk about words in drafts because they will be part of the negotiations.  I assure the Deputy that we are all trying to find a settlement and, within that settlement, I am conscious that any changes we have made to our Constitution &mdash; this has been stated for many years, particularly since the 1990 period &mdash; have to be balanced constitutional changes which means that the Government of Ireland Act will have to be amended also.  We must achieve a balanced, comprehensive settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his assurance but will he agree that some of us in this House have applied what we would describe as a self-denying ordnance in relation to what we would say on matters of sensitivity in Northern Ireland?  That ordnance might be applied by other people in the House, including members of his own party who have recently made some remarks.  Also, will the Taoiseach agree that part of the reason for having a local assembly in Northern Ireland, and the local executive elected from that assembly, is that by working together tackling the social, political, economic and other problems afflicting the people of Northern Ireland, people of different traditions will be brought closer together and that will bring about reconciliation?  Will he agree that in circumstances where people are sharing power and responsibility, the more power and responsibility they share, the better?  Will the Taoiseach agree it is illogical that in 1998, when we celebrate the United Irishmen and Wolfe Tone, one of whose basic ideals was to cut the connection with Britain, we should not be looking to give back to Irishmen &mdash; Catholic, Protestant and dissenter &mdash;&mdash;<Col N="1282" /> as much power from Britain as they can operate together?  Finally, in view of a British Government report yesterday on voting abuse in Northern Ireland, and its conclusion that it can do nothing about this problem in advance of a referendum, will the Taoiseach again bring to the attention of the British authorities the fact that the forthcoming referendum will create opportunities and temptations for vote abuse greater than anything experienced before because of the constitutional implications of the referendum?  Assiduous efforts ought to be made, therefore, to stamp out vote abuse which is absolutely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the last question first, the Deputy made that point strongly during Question Time on a number of occasions recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have personal experience of the issue on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I passed on the Deputy's views and we also had an opportunity to have a brief conversation on them.  I take the Deputy's point and I have raised those matters elsewhere. Deputy Currie referred to co-operation and goodwill.  We are now just a few weeks from Easter and I remain encouraged, from the conversations I had last week in the United States, that people will make an effort.  We will have to wait to see whether that effort leads to a comprehensive, fair and balanced agreement.  The Government will do all it can to assist the parties as much as possible to come to an agreement.  We can do no more than that.  Under the three stranded approach that has been in existence since the time of the former Secretary of State, Mr. Brooke, in the early 1990s, and earlier, we can, with the parties in the North, build up an assembly where the powers currently devolved to Westminster will return to where they should have been in the first place, namely, with the people of Northern Ireland who will work through those issues which directly affect the lives of people in the North.</P>
      <P>Other matters could then be dealt with in terms of the North-South dimension with a proper, powerful and dynamic executive body which could deal with issues on their merits collectively with members representative of these Houses. While it would not happen overnight, I have no doubt that, in time, such a structure would mean that the island of Ireland would be far better served in the hands of the people of Ireland.  We would see the benefits of that very quickly in a way which we have never seen before.  I am convinced of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continually restate and debate that position and I have not heard any arguments by any of the parties, regardless of their persuasion or what they might have said in the past, which make a good case against it.  It is another matter to see that they all agree and sign up to it but we must continue to try to convince them to so do.  I cannot see a better solution.  Any other solution <Col N="1283" /> would not lead us to consent but would continue down the road of dissent, difficulties and troubles. I hope it would not lead to violence but that is the way it has inevitably gone for hundreds of years.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party leader, Deputy Quinn, I join with the Taoiseach in his comments to the US President on the excellent work of the US Ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith.</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 21, the Taoiseach said he had met &ldquo;some&rdquo; party leaders and spokespersons.  Did he meet Mr. Trimble?  If so, does he share the optimism reflected in the newspapers about Mr. Trimble's view on all-Ireland or cross-Border bodies?</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 22, it is essential for the House to be given, as soon as possible, the views of the Government on the proposed changes to Articles 2 and 3 and any other changes required to reach a compromise and settlement. We do not want to prejudice the ongoing work on reaching an agreement but, as the Taoiseach can imagine, it is essential for the House to be in a position to debate these issues as early as possible so that we can bring the country with us, particularly in view of some of the comments made by certain people last weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his constructive remarks.  Yes, I met David Trimble.  Yes, I welcomed the recognition in his speech to the Ulster Unionist Council at the weekend that North-South bodies would greatly enhance co-operation between the North and the South, would be enormously liberating for the people of Ireland as a whole and could potentially mean an end to our internal cold war.  I thought that was helpful.  I suppose he said a few other things which I did not consider very helpful but one cannot have it every way.</P>

      <P>In regard to what I said earlier, I know the House will understand that because all the agreement stands together no one part can be taken in isolation &mdash; if one part falls it all falls.  However, I will communicate with the party leaders and the House at the earliest date possible.  The House will ultimately be communicated with anyway if there is an agreement in that a referendum Bill would have to be passed by the House.</P>

What kind and scale of investment is envisaged?  What conditions would be attached?  Will it cover areas that are not open to private investment, such as the provision of sewerage and water facilities and refuse dumps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The body in question is an advisory board to the Taoiseach of the day.  It has served a number of Taoisigh.  The value of the board principally derives from the practical experience of its members who are heads of major financial and manufacturing organisations. They regularly travel to and from Ireland and many of them hold investments here, such as through the IFSC.  They hold strong and passionate views.  I last met them when I was Minister for Finance.  We discussed the issue of venture capital for small businesses and how that can help them grow.</P>
      <P>Given that we will not have the same access to EU Structural Funds for capital purposes we should look at the private investment initiatives used in many other countries.  Many of the schemes which operate in these countries are designed on the Irish financial system.  Our banks operate many of them, in the UK and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The members of the board seek to advise on how we could usefully operate such initiatives in the period ahead and engage in what would be considered to be both productive investment and infrastructural investment projects.  I take the view that this will be a must after 2006, if not before.  Other countries have been engaged in these activities for many years.  We will have to look at them and agree on the best model.  The board members will at least help us to consider the alternatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The independent inquiry on matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming is being carried out by Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC.  Dr. Murphy, who is conducting his investigations in private, reported on 10 March on progress to date at his inquiry.  He indicated that almost 50 hours of hearing has been held since his appointment on 10 February with victims, parents of victims, coaches and officials from the Irish Amateur Swimming Association and its Leinster branch. He has also received written submissions, including a large amount of documentation from the swimming bodies, in relation to their organisation in general and to their procedures for dealing with complaints in particular.  I understand Dr. Murphy will include details of the number of parties who made submissions or who gave interviews to the inquiry in his final report.</P>
      <P>Dr. Murphy proposes to continue to hear evidence up to the end of this week.  By that time he expects to have sufficient material available to him from submissions and interviews to prepare a report which addresses the matters raised in the terms of reference of the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Dr. Murphy aims to complete his report by the end of the month and once I have received it and given it initial consideration I intend to make its findings public.  However, a decision on publication of the full contents of the report cannot be made until it is received and all the implications of publication have been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, unless the full report is published, the report and the procedures which have been followed hitherto will be seriously devalued?  I await the publication of the report.  Despite my request, the Minister did not publish the interim report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> Will he consider lifting the financial sanctions he imposed on the IASA in the interests of catering for the athletes?  The only people who have been victimised and have suffered because of these sanctions are the athletes who are being hindered in their preparations for international events.  It is ironic that the only people who have suffered and who may have to pay are the athletes, who are the innocent parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to publish as much of the report as possible.  However, the Deputy must be aware that I cannot prejudice the report.  We must wait until Dr. Murphy produces it.</P>
      <P>None of the national organisations have received their allocations for 1998; they do not receive them until the end of April.  I have circulated them with a request to bring forward for consideration their strategies for 1998.  They will then be paid in full.  The IASA is not at any disadvantage as a result of the actions which I have taken.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that I am punishing the swimmers.  However, this is a matter for those involved in swimming, not me.  The Government assists young people involved in swimming in every way possible and will continue to support them.  The IASA receives the second or third largest allocation of any governing body.  It must ensure its house is in order.  I have taken action on the organisation to ensue that a safe environment exists for swimmers.  When the report becomes available I will be prepared to lift the sanctions against the swimmers.  However, I will not be made to lift them until such time as I am satisfied that a safe environment exists.</P>
      <P>By the time the national organisations are due to receive funding for 1998 I will have received Dr. Murphy's report, including his conclusions.  I also hope to have received the views of the IASA on the report.  When it has shown how it is responding to the report I will be able to lift the sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments. When the IASA attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, it expressed concern about funding.  There must be a retrospective procedure involved in its funding. It advised the committee it would run out of funds in two to three months and would scale down its international programme.  I hope that when the Minister receives the report he will ensure swimmers are protected, an aim shared by all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated the number of hours Dr. Murphy has spent interviewing.  Does he have any idea of the number of people who refused to give evidence?  Is he aware that over the weekend two very prominent people, Michelle De Bruin and Gary O'Toole, expressed surprise that they were not asked to give evidence.  These two people have already made a major contribution to swimming, but one in particular intimated many years ago that problems had arisen and no <Col N="1287" /> action was taken.  Would the Minister not agree that Mr. O'Toole in particular should have been asked to give evidence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question about the number of people because this is a private inquiry.  However, I am sure Dr. Murphy's report will make clear the number of people who came forward.  It will not be possible to know how many did not come forward.  As to the recent article on the question of people who were not asked to come forward, in mid-February we placed an advertisement in the national newspapers which constituted an open invitation to everybody concerned, including people outside swimming, to come forward and help the inquiry if they wished to do so.  It was initially thought that we would have a report by 10 March. However, this work had to be carried out meticulously, and so many people came forward that it was decided to extend the time limit until the end of this week.  It is still open to people to come forward up to Friday.  I would encourage everybody who has information to offer to avail of this opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not imply we are not concerned about the safety of the environment for swimmers.  What I am concerned about is the uncertainty surrounding the future of funding for the IASA which is causing concern among some of our leading swimmers.  I am not making this up.  The Minister surely heard the interviews given by some of our top swimmers expressing their concern.  Will the Minister give a guarantee in the House that, irrespective of the outcome of the tribunal, and whether funding goes through the IASA or through a third party, our top swimmers and athletes will not be penalised because of this controversy.  Will the Minister clear the air for those people who are preparing for world championships, who are preparing a programme for the next Olympics, and who are now in a serious state of uncertainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give a guarantee until I am absolutely satisfied that swimming provides a safe environment for all who participate in it.  On the question of funding, which is £230,000, the second largest sum received by any national governing body, this funding does not apply until the end of April.  No national governing body will receive any funding until that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that when the IASA appeared before an Oireachtas committee it stated that the code of ethics, albeit a voluntary code of ethics, was now being operated rigidly in all clubs and branches.  The public in general has welcomed the fact that the IASA had the opportunity to say that definitively.  On the basis that clubs are operating within the guidelines and that the safety of swimmers is protected, it is important that funding be restored.  I want to be as positive as can be.  I had a communication directly from the IASA to the effect that because of the uncertainty of their future they are curtailing some international events, particularly the international event in Hamburg.  We want to make sure that our top class swimmers, who are innocent in all of this, are facilitated in every way possible by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not unfortunate that it should take an incident like this to prompt everybody to take note of Deputy Allen's code of ethics, which we have all praised in the past?  I will ensure that the swimming association will be able to go ahead with future competitions.  I do not want to hinder it in any way.  However, I will not restore funding until it is quite clear that any deficiencies are dealt with and the code of ethics is implemented. I want to restore funding to the IASA but I must await the Murphy report and the IASA's response to it.  Having met officials of the IASA I am quite sure of their determination to bring their sport up to the level where it should be.  I have no doubt that these dedicated officials will be able to do that and that I will be able to restore funding at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of whether the inquiry deems the IASA fit to distribute funding or to manage its affairs, will the Minister give a commitment that funding will be made available, through the High Performance Committee of the Sports Council or through another body, to enable our athletes who are now under a cloud of uncertainty to prepare for world class events. The present situation is unfair to them.  Like the other victims, they are innocent victims in all of this.  I am only trying to find a way of comforting these people by trying to ensure their efforts will not be for nought.</P>

      <P>The future of swimming rests with the swimming fraternity.  It is up to them to convince me and others that there is a safe environment for swimmers and that the happenings of the past cannot be repeated.  We should not go ahead if circumstances still exist which gave rise to abuse in the past.  Nobody would want that, nor would the elite swimmers.  They would be the first people not to agree to go ahead in such circumstances.  They want to ensure that everything is as it should be in their sport.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 383 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development and is being conducted in full compliance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997 and in the Irish media on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within this deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intention to submit full tenders before the deadline for so doing, 14 November.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was 5 p.m. on Monday, 2 February.  Bord Fáilte received full tender submissions from five consortia and immediately commenced its assessment of the submissions. The deliberations of Bord Fáilte and the management board are continuing but they are expected to be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will then be required in respect of any final selection made.  It is hoped the grant offer can be made to the successful candidate by mid-July who will then be able to proceed with construction plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A specific timetable for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the Government and <Col N="1290" /> the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place.  The tender procedure is being organised by Bord Fáilte and the independent management board.

      <P>Following the Government's decision in November 1997 to provide grant assistance up to a maximum of £5 million towards the cost of implementing Ireland's bid for the Special Olympics world summer games in 2003, a formal bid was submitted by the organisers, Special Olympics Ireland, to the official governing body, Special Olympics International.</P>

      <P>I understand one of the contenders for the location of the games is a South American country.  The Deputy will be aware this is the first time the Special Olympics may be held outside the United States.  It is between Ireland and another bidder at present.  There will be approximately 7,000 athletes from 160 countries participating in 19 different sports.  Approximately 28,000 family members and friends will also attend and it is estimated that up to 100 international media outlets could also be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has kept in contact with the selection committee which is a marvellous group. We met various ambassadors on its behalf and <Col N="1291" /> they have agreed to provide interpreters, etc.  We also met heads of universities and others who could provide accommodation.  They have all been positive and we hope a successful Special Olympics games could be held in Ireland if its bid is selected.</P>

      <P>The other country is Argentina and I thank the Deputy for reminding me.  I will try to ensure that this worthy event is brought to Ireland.  I ask all those involved to ensure that the large amount of sponsorship, particularly corporate sponsorship, that is needed is secured.  The commitments to date amount to a little more than £1 million and corporate sponsorship in Ireland and the United States is being sought.  Local sponsorship is also needed.  As the Deputy is aware, it is intended to bring the representatives of each country to different towns and counties. I hope local businesses will sponsor athletes for certain amounts.  I look forward to such sponsorship and knowing the Irish people, I am sure they will provide it.  In common with the Deputy, I will ensure that everything possible is done to bring the Special Olympics to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the most recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office, the total number of visitors to Ireland in 1997 is estimated to be 5,164,000, an increase of 9 per cent on the 1996 figure.  I am delighted to report that 1997 was a record year for tourism with estimates for foreign exchange earnings expected to be in excess of £2 billion. We are now on target to meet and exceed the ambitious targets set out in the operational programme for tourism, 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> In 1997 there was a strong performance from a number of northern Continental European markets with the Benelux countries, Denmark and Sweden all recording good growth.  However, tourist numbers from Continental Europe as a whole remained static at just under 1.2 million. The reasons were varied.  For example, most mainland European countries recorded only marginal economic growth in 1997.  More importantly, some major currencies, such as the deutschmark and the French franc, were at their weakest for some four to five years against the IR£.  According to Bord Fáilte, this discouraged individual travel and was a deterrent to active promotion by many tour operators.  The temporary cessation of year round direct ferry links may also have had some impact on shoulder and low season group traffic.</P>
    <P>These difficulties were not unique to Ireland and were experienced also by Britain, Scandinavia and other northern &ldquo;non-sun&rdquo; destinations with which Ireland competes.  For example, the European travel monitor, which is a standard Europe wide travel survey, shows that German traffic to all northern Europe, including Britain and Scandinavia, declined by 15 per cent in 1997 while French traffic to northern Europe was down by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the tourism sector shares my concern about the relative under performance of the mainland European market for Ireland in recent years given that Ireland has performed exceptionally well elsewhere and made market share gains in British, North American and Australian markets.  Specifically, a full examination of the prospects for Ireland in the German market is currently being undertaken by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with its industry partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>One expects substantial growth in tourist numbers during an economic boom and Bord Fáilte is good at putting forward a rosy picture.  Does the Minister agree we should look beyond economic stagnation and currency fluctuations as the reason for tourist numbers from continental Europe remaining static?  When will the 1997 visitors' attitude survey be published?  My main concern is about the German and Italian markets.  Does the Minister agree it is unsatisfactory that Dublin and its surrounding areas should experience double digit growth while the south west and west experienced low single digit growth?</P>

      <P>Most of our tourist traffic is funnelled through Dublin and as 60 per cent of European visitors are under 40 they are more attracted to the bright lights of urban areas.  Will the Minister ask Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus to emphasise the attractiveness of Shannon and Cork as access points?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy on the publication of the visitors' attitude survey.  The reasons I outlined for the difficulties with the French and German markets are genuine.  People from those countries are not travelling to northern European countries or to the UK.  There has been a 10 per cent decrease in the number of German tourists and a 5 per cent decrease in the number of French tourists. However, there has been an overall increase of approximately 213,000 tourists from the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>There is a huge potential for attracting more tourists here.  Even though approximately 5.2 million tourists visited Ireland in 1997, it is only 1 per cent of the entire European market.  I intend to make the selling of Ireland abroad a priority in the next few months.  A mere 1 per cent of the European tourism market is not sufficient during an economic boom.  We are trying to attract visitors from Germany and France from a Dublin base.  While that should not be impossible with the necessary technology, I have indicated to Bord Fáilte that I would like a more hands-on approach to those markets and I asked it to consider placing people in Europe with a view to attracting more tourists from those countries.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that Dublin is benefiting most from the increase in tourist numbers, but there has been an increase in revenue and numbers in all regions although some have not has fared as well as others.  For example, there has been a 20 per cent increase in the north-west as opposed to an 85 per cent increase on the east coast.  I have held discussions with representatives of Aer Lingus regarding access points and its response was that if there is a demand for Cork, Galway or Donegal they will meet it.  Aer Lingus is a commercial company and will operate only where there is a demand.</P>
      <P>The marketing of Ireland as a tourism destination has had positive results.  Dublin is the most cosmopolitan city in Europe and has benefited from weekend breaks.  I urge the regional tourism authorities, who have been given additional funding this year, to promote the regions as attractive destinations.  There is no reason the weekend short-stay holidays, that have been a great success in Dublin, could not become a feature of other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware the figures published by Bord Fáilte are spectacular, but it was honest enough to admit there are difficulties in respect of France and Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What form of a hands-on approach should be taken to attract more tourists from the continent, in particular the French and Germans who are big spenders?  I hope we can attract them to Shannon and Cork as well as to Dublin.  I have had preliminary discussions with Bord Fáilte with a view to assisting it in bringing a political dimension to tourism promotion in the countries we are <Col N="1294" /> trying to target.  Does the Minister agree with that line of attack?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We should make every possible effort to attract tourists from the European market, particularly from the huge German and French markets.  Of course there should be a political hands-on approach and Ministers adopt such an approach when they go abroad on European business.  I cannot over emphasise the importance of marketing, particularly with the advent of an expected reduction in EU funding.  That is why, in conjunction with the private sector, we are trying to ensure that funding is maintained and increased.  While there is a political dimension to it there is nothing to compare with the private sector approach.  I was approached recently by a person in the bed and breakfast sector in County Down who complained they were not getting adequate numbers of visitors because they happen to feature in a Bórd Fáilte brochure.  They took the initiative, travelled to a certain part of Germany where they did their own marketing and as a result increased their business that year by 350 per cent.  While we have to market at national level the private sector must play its part also.  We have a tradition and a culture and it is popular to be Irish in the world today.  We have much to sell and it is only a matter of providing the finance and the hands-on approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>While projections for the UK are excellent, we expect an increase of a further 10 per cent on our 1997 record of almost three million, given that major sporting events &mdash; the Tour de France on the weekend of 12 July and the tall ships in mid-August &mdash; are taking place here.  We have huge potential for increasing tourist numbers particularly from the UK.  We expect a 7 per cent increase from the buoyant US market but the indications are that the European market will continue to be sluggish unless something is done about it.  That is the reason I have asked for a hands-on approach, in other words that somebody in charge of the European market should be based in Europe to stimulate that huge market which has enormous potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> As regards the situation at the airport I am disappointed the dispute arose, particularly as it involved tourism and the business area, but that is a matter outside my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the traffic growth figures for the past ten years.  Of an increase of 8.5 million, 7 million went to Dublin, 0.9 million to Cork and 0.6 million to Shannon. Those figures speak for themselves.  Will the Minister agree that marketing alone is not the answer?  We need to review policy in relation to access to Ireland.  If everybody is coming through Dublin, a large number will stay in the greater Dublin area and therefore there will be an imbalance of growth.  There is need for a review of transport policy in relation to access.  Is the Minister concerned that one of the major ferries has pulled out of the southern region which means people are even more dependent on coming through the east coast?  Will the Minister review the question of access in conjunction with his colleague who has responsibility for communications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the question of access is of enormous importance.  Given our airports, this is the best way to attract people to Ireland.  The whole question of access should be appraised. Dublin has a huge benefit because of its access facilities.  Aer Lingus has done a tremendous job by providing extra flights to the US in recent months.  Continental tourists will be coming in the next few months.  Extra charters from four European cities will go to various destinations during the summer.  Delta will play its part.</P>
      <P>A recent survey indicated that 90 per cent of visitors to Glasgow and Edinburgh eventually make their way to London.  If visitors come on charter flights to Cork, Shannon and Galway it is possible they will find their way to Dublin.  In my discussions with Aer Lingus it was pointed out that if there is a demand to get to the regions, it will have no hesitation in providing extra capacity.  I look forward to 1998 when increased capacity will be provided by Delta, Aer Lingus, Continental and four chartered routes from Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 39 to 43, inclusive, and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government appointed Dr. Roderick Murphy, SC, on 10 February to Chair an independent inquiry, currently under way, into the following matters relating to the incidence of child sexual abuse in swimming: the arrangements which the IASA, the Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs, had in place since 1975 for the detection and prevention of child sexual abuse; the procedures, including functional responsibility, which the IASA, the Leinster Branch and affiliated clubs had in place for securing compliance with these arrangements; the manner in which complaints in relation to sexual abuse made to the IASA, the Leinster Branch, affiliated clubs and a named school were dealt with over that period; the manner in which any complaints in relation to two named coaches reported to the IASA, their Leinster Branch, affiliated clubs and a named school were handled by them over that period; the arrangements which the IASA, their branches and affiliated clubs now have in place to detect and prevent child sexual abuse, including arrangements while complaints are being investigated, and sanctions; and the adequacy of <Col N="1297" /> arrangements now in place for the protection of children in swimming.</P>
    <P>Participation in the inquiry is by way of written submission and-or interview, all of which are being dealt with in strict confidence.  Given the private and factual nature of the inquiry and its procedures, it is not normal practice, I understand, in such circumstances for the State to offer assistance for legal representation for participants.</P>
    <P>However, a strong wish was expressed by some victims that they be accompanied by their legal adviser when attending for interview because without such presence they would be reluctant to participate in the inquiry.  Having considered the matter, the Government decided, as an exceptional measure, to offer assistance towards legal costs incurred by the victims, involved in incidents covered by the terms of reference, in arranging for the attendance of their legal advisers at interviews.  Government set a maximum of £500 for the State's contribution towards such costs, having regard to the nature of the inquiry and of the role required of victims' legal advisers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, IASA, Dr. Murphy has indicated that he has already received considerable co-operation from the association and its Leinster branch, including interviews with coaches and officials, written submissions and documentation in relation to its organisation in general and to its procedures for dealing with complaints in particular.</P>
    <P>Dr. Murphy expects to complete his report by the end of March by which time he expects to have sufficient material available to him from submissions and interviews to address the matters raised in the terms of reference of the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue does not involve big business or the serious problem of misappropriation of funds.  It is the more sensitive and serious issue of child abuse.  The Minister in his Scrooge-like and insensitive approach to the matter of legal representation is giving the wrong signals and the Government's decision is a deterrent to some people coming forward.  In view of the other defects in the inquiry, will the Minister consider removing the cap on legal expenses so that everybody who wishes to come forward and give evidence is encouraged to do so and people are not deterred by the risk of incurring heavy legal expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government made its decision in the interests of the victims, the parents of victims and in the interests of children.  The inquiry has been a tremendous success with regard to the number of people coming forward. On previous occasions, accusations were made that I was compelling people to come forward but the only people we sought to compel were those who wished to come forward in confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cap on the amount of <Col N="1298" /> money being made available for the victims' legal expenses, such a decision was not considered in the context of any other inquiry.  It was never previously offered.  The Government made this proposal because there are exceptional circumstances.  It does not prevent people coming forward.  Dr. Murphy indicated he would accept people coming forward whether they do so in a private capacity or are accompanied by their legal advisers.  Some people prefer to be accompanied by their legal advisers.</P>
    <P>In certain instances, this matter has been abused by certain people in the legal profession. There were advertisements encouraging people to come forward to what was virtually a seminar for advice.  It was a self-marketing, profile generating exercise.  Nobody need feel put out by the fact that a cap has been imposed on legal expenses.  It is a generous offer and, to date, it has not prevented anybody coming forward to give their evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people, by virtue of their positions in the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, will be obliged or expected to give evidence.  Does the Minister not agree that the cap is a disincentive to some of them, particularly because of their stated views on this subject and the evidence they have already given to the media?  If they are to be facilitated and to ensure that Dr. Murphy is given the most extensive information possible, there should be no preclusion, whether it be legal fees or otherwise, on their coming forward, without fear of repercussions with regard to their evidence.  Some of these people carried out individual internal inquiries in contravention of the code of ethics and they now realise it was the wrong thing to do.  Nevertheless, they are expected to give that evidence to this confidential committee but if they are precluded from being properly represented it will be a disincentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Deputy.  Nobody has been precluded from coming forward by the cap on the fees.  Everybody was invited to come forward and Dr. Murphy allowed people to come forward on their own initiative.  However, in the case of the officials and coaches, he approached the people he considered necessary for submissions.  He made direct approaches to certain people but it was left up to the victims and the parents of victims to come forward should they decide to do so.  He did not feel he should intervene in their private decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said everybody was invited to come forward.  Is he satisfied that no material witness will be precluded from coming forward as a result of the cap on legal fees?  What is his best estimate of the likely costs to the Exchequer arising from the inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs to the Exchequer are a matter for the Attorney General.  I cannot answer <Col N="1299" /> the Deputy's question in that regard.  I do not believe anybody should feel precluded from coming forward because of the cap on the legal fees.</P>

      <P>This is a great day for the Labour Party.  It is nice at any time to have two new Deputies elected.  It is not something one would get fed up with.  I can, therefore, understand why the Labour Party feel very pleased today.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and wish her well.  I am told she is the first woman to be elected in Limerick East in many decades.  We see men and women as being equal in this House and have been trying for many years to improve the representation of women.  The election of Deputy O'Sullivan will be seen, therefore, as an added bonus.  She worked extremely hard during the years at all levels.  She worked her way through the system.  We in Fianna Fáil, congratulate her sincerely.  It was a great victory.</P>
      <P>I have known Deputy Seán Ryan for a long time in all walks of life in north County Dublin. He has had his ups and downs.  He has had a few great days and a few terrible days.  This is a great day for him.  I congratulate him and wish him every success.</P>
      <P>I also thank our own colleagues, Sandra Marsh who battled hard in Limerick East and Michael Kennedy in Dublin North.  They finished in second place behind two excellent Deputies.

    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> This is a good day for women.  The candidates who finished first, second and third in Limerick East were women.  This will help to redress the gender imbalance.  We lost some of our number in the last general election.  I pay tribute to my party's fine candidate, Mary Jackman, who nearly made it.</P>
    <P>I welcome back my friend, Deputy Seán Ryan. Those of us who have worked with him in Dublin North know how diligently he works for his constituents.  Now that he is back in the Dáil he will keep us on our toes.</P>
    <P>This is also a great day for the families of Deputies O'Sullivan and Ryan, although there is a sense of poignancy about the proceedings. Shortly we will pay tribute to the memory of a late Member.  This is a sign of the strength of our democracy and that life goes on.  I wish both Deputies a full and fruitful career in the House.</P>

I know how much he missed being here.  By any standard, he is a hard-working public representative and I have no doubt he will apply the same vigour to the task ahead as he did on a previous occasion.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Jan O'Sullivan to Dáil Éireann, although she is not a newcomer to the Oireachtas.  I am delighted the people of Limerick have elected their first woman Deputy.  It is extraordinary that so many parts of the country have still to elect their first female Deputies.  I wish Deputy O'Sullivan well in the task ahead.  She has four male colleagues to contend with &mdash; Deputies Noonan, O'Dea, Wade and O'Malley.  I am sure she will be well able for them.</P>

It is a sign of the strength of independence of mind of the electorate that they are prepared to elect Deputies of high calibre to this House in by-elections regardless of their normal voting patterns.  This is a growing feature of Irish politics.  Long may it last. I have no doubt Deputies O'Sullivan and Ryan will make excellent Deputies.  Deputy Ryan proved this on a previous occasion while Deputy <Col N="1302" /> O'Sullivan has proved her worth in the Seanad. Long may they remain in the House.</P>

      <P>Although one could describe Deputy Jan O'Sullivan as a new Deputy, she is renowned as a former Senator and mayor of Limerick.  I know her as a person who speaks out on various issues a trait for which she is to be admired and commended.  It is not always easy, comfortable or popular to do so.  On behalf of the Green Party, I welcome her to the House.</P>
      <P>I extend a wholehearted welcome to my constituency colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan.  Although this may sound strange coming from a rival, I shared his disappointment at his failure to win a seat in the general election following which a photograph appeared on the front page of our local newspaper, <i>The Fingal Independent</i> under which it was stated that Deputy Ryan was congratulating me.  The fact is I was commiserating with him in a heartfelt way on being pipped for the seat.  It is important that I put the record straight.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate my constituency colleague, Paul Martin, on his forthright performance as a first time candidate and Eric Shepherd in Limerick East.</P>

I also congratulate the other candidates who stood in Limerick East on the manner in which they conducted their campaigns.

      <P>Deputy Hugh Coveney ennobled the profession of politics.  His tragic and untimely death has robbed all of us in politics of one of its most highly thought of members.  The feeling of desolation that descended on us, his colleagues in Fine Gael, has been shared throughout the country by all other parties and by those who knew Hugh in politics, sport and the business world.  On behalf of Fine Gael, I thank the members of all parties who have paid such fine tributes to Hugh. It is a true measure of the man that people from all political backgrounds have only good things to say about him.</P>
      <P>If our sense of loss is so deeply felt, it is nothing compared to the pain and devastation felt by Pauline, Patrick, Simon, Rory, Tony, Andrew, Rebecca and David and all the relatives of Hugh and Pauline.  Words are inadequate to express the depth of sympathy we extend to Pauline and the family, but I hope they will gain some comfort from the outpourings of respect and love for Hugh which were manifest in the tributes paid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel certain that Hugh, who never sought out praise, would be embarrassed by it all.  Despite all his talents, he was a genuinely shy and modest man.  Because of his innate sense of decency and his willingness to find points of consensus rather <Col N="1304" /> than difference, Hugh would be heartened that he achieved in his death the consensus across party lines which does not always exist.</P>
    <P>Hugh's achievements have been well documented &mdash; his successful professional practice in Cork, his election to Cork Corporation in 1979, his election to the Dáil in 1981, his term as Lord Mayor of Cork which he considered a great honour, his worldwide renown as a yachtsman and his distinguished period as Minister for Defence and the Marine and as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  Despite all the successes of Hugh's life, he never lost touch with his roots. He was utterly diligent in his representation of the people of Cork through politics.  He was also totally committed to improving Cork by judicious investment and by sharing his material wealth for the betterment of Cork and its people.  This commitment to Cork's business life and to its people was carried out in Hugh's normal modest way.  It is only since his tragic death that we know of some of his generosity, particularly to people less well-off than himself.</P>
    <P>Hugh, like all of us, faced disappointments in his life.  He lost his seat in this House in 1987 and I shared that defeat with him.  I know he was upset by that loss because we often talked about it.  I recall with great warmth how he advised me to keep trying as I might be back some day.  I am glad his words came to pass.  He decided to return to his business life.  In 1994 he agreed to stand in the by-election for Fine Gael, thus showing his loyalty to this party that he loved and his commitment to public service.  He was rewarded by the people of Cork when he won the by-election.</P>
    <P>Hugh faced his removal from ministerial office with a dignity and lack of rancour which were his hallmarks and he proceeded to make a dynamic and important contribution as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  As Minister for Justice, I was indebted to his input into the most extensive prison building programme ever undertaken in the State.  Hugh's professional training was an invaluable asset in the work of the committee he chaired.  He was so proud when he travelled to Castlerea with me to view the fruits of his endeavours and to share the opening of the first phase of that prison.  The staff of the Office of Public Works who worked with him on that committee told me many times of their great admiration for Hugh's work and commitment.</P>
    <P>As one of the ministerial team at the Northern Ireland talks, Hugh's role cannot be underestimated.  I spent many hours with him at that time and watched his skill in dealing with the sensitive relationships among the participants.  His input was vital at a time when the tiniest of detail had the capacity to cause great conflict.  I remember on one occasion when Hugh was the sole Government representative at the talks for a particular few days during discussions on the agenda agreement was arrived at thanks to his skilful negotiating powers.  I passed on to him the warm words <Col N="1305" /> of thanks of Sir Patrick Mayhew and the chairman, Mr. George Mitchell, but Hugh, in his usual self-effacing manner, said: &ldquo;Go on out of that, Nora&rdquo;.  However, I knew that deep down he was immensely satisfied with the part he was playing in bringing about a peaceful solution to Northern Ireland and an end to the killing and maiming of Irish men, women and children on this island.  The finest tribute to Hugh Coveney will be a successful outcome to the present talks.  If he were here today, he would wish the Taoiseach and his Government great success in their endeavours, as we all do in this House.</P>
    <P>Hugh's love and devotion to his wife and children were exemplary.  It was an honour and a pleasure to be around any combination of the Coveney family, as I and many of my colleagues were during the by-election he won.  The close bonds of family were so evident.  I will forever remember the sight of his and Pauline's fine looking children in their red sweatshirts proclaiming Coveney for all to see on the roadsides of Cork city and county.  Their good fortune to have Hugh and Pauline as their parents will, I hope, help to comfort them in their great loss and help them to fulfil all their ambitions as a tribute to their late father.</P>
    <P>In reviewing Hugh Coveney's life, I was reminded of the parable of the talents.  Hugh was blessed with some talents at his birth but he increased them and shared the benefits of his knowledge and success with so many people who will be grateful for his life and generosity.  To Pauline, Patrick, Simon, Rory, Tony, Andrew, Rebecca and David I extend, on behalf of John Bruton, myself and all the members of Fine Gael throughout the country, our heartfelt sympathy and say it was an honour to have shared our lives, even for a short time, with a man such as Hugh Coveney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Owen and our colleagues in the House in this expression of sympathy.  It was with profound shock and regret, that I and all my colleagues on this side of the House learned of Hugh Coveney's sudden and tragic death.  He was a man of outstanding character, tremendous ability and great personal charm.  It is not always the case that a Member gets to know Members on the opposite side that well, but over the years Hugh got to know practically all the Members and that says something great about him.  He was a man of great courtesy and his personal qualities of integrity and sincerity were combined with, as Deputy Owen said, a quiet sense of humour which earned him the affection and respect of all Members of the Oireachtas over the years and of all those who came into contact with him in his extended interests outside this House.  The guard of honour by Members on all sides of the House, of which unfortunately I could not be a part, on the occasion of his funeral and the vast numbers who attended his funeral were a striking testament to the high regard in which he was held by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> I got to know Hugh very well in recent years.  I have known him since l981 when he was elected to this House and he lived near my relations in Cork.  I had many dealings with him over that period.  He was impressive to deal with in business or in any discussion.  He was impressive in his physical presence, showed great courtesy and positive enthusiasm for his life's work regardless of whatever aspect he discussed.</P>
    <P>To his wife Pauline, his daughter, sons and the rest of his family, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our deepest condolences on their tremendous loss.  They will miss him most and while we will miss him we can only imagine what it is like for his family.  His colleagues in Fine Gael were very proud of him as a parliamentarian and of his work in this House from l981 to l987, of his by-election victory for his party and his period as Minister for Defence and the Marine to which he could not have been better suited.  I agree with what Deputy Owen said.  I have heard officials on many occasions speak of his professionalism in handling that brief because of his great interest in sailing.  He would have been professional in any brief, but that was one he particularly loved.  He was professional in his duties with the Office of Public Works, the budget committee and the Northern Ireland talks.  I was with most of the people who took part in the talks with him when I heard the tragic news.  I reiterate what Deputy Owen said.  They knew him well and all shared the same view of him similar to the view that has been expressed here.  On a lighter note &mdash; that is not easy, given where many of them stand on most issues.  I am sure his family would be proud of that.</P>
    <P>In his recent position as spokesperson for Agriculture and Food, I got more letters from him than any other Member of the shadow Cabinet. He dealt with matters by writing letters setting out his view, particularly on the issue of third country markets.  He wrote giving advice rather than raising criticisms.</P>
    <P>He was a very successful Lord Mayor.  He was able to link the political, business and community aspects of matters which many of us do not have the ability to do.  I recently met him at a meeting of the Cork Chamber of Commerce in which he played a key role in the early 1980s.  He secured the highest ever vote as a Cork councillor in the 1979 elections.</P>
    <P>Many of my discussions with Hugh were about sport.  We shared a love of sport, but not a love of the same sports.  As his sons and daughter know, when he kindly asked me to launch their voyage on the <i>Golden Apple</i> to raise funds for Chernobyl, it took most of them to keep me on the boat because I am not brave when it comes to the sea.  We had good fun that day and I considered it an honour that he asked me, as Taoiseach, to launch the world voyage on which five of his seven children set forth.  I know from talking to them today that they hope to complete it sometime.  I hope they do because he would have wished them to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> He captained Ireland's representatives in offshore events in the 1970s and 1980s.  He captained Ireland in the 1979 Admiral Cup, which was difficult at times due to storms.  Given all that and all he achieved in his business life, he was a man of remarkable success and talent.  It will take his family many years to get over the tragic loss and also his colleagues in Fine Gael.  Members will not get over his loss easily.  He was held in high esteem by all.

      <P>It was said in recent days that the best way of having one's worth recognised in this country is to die.  Many tributes were paid to Hugh Coveney from all political quarters in recent days.  The shock of his sudden death receded and the recognition dawned on all of us of the loss to public and political life of Hugh's passing.  More than ever before we have a sense of the worth of that wonderful parliamentarian. On behalf of the Labour Party, I express our sympathy to the Fine Gael Party and most especially to Hugh Coveney's family.  Hugh's death is an immeasurable loss to Pauline, the boys and his daughter.</P>
      <P>As someone who worked with him in Government, I found he had an extraordinary ability to work with people from every political persuasion. His passing has evoked an almost unique sense of rallying across the political spectrum.  In Cabinet he had an ambitious work programme.  He had a tremendous enthusiasm for the Department of the Marine, in particular, and the Department of Defence.  He was well able to negotiate his stand. I remember in relation to Structural Funds when he and I were in two separate Departments bidding for money for roads in my case and ports in his, he did rather well and the final proposal accepted by Government was much more generous to the Marine than the original one.  That was a measure of the tact he brought to bear on the important work he had.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, he was an accomplished yachtsman and represented this country at international level.  I know he brought that passion for the sea to Cabinet and, coming from a marine county, I know he endeared himself in a rather unique way to those who live in our coastal communities.  They had an extraordinarily high regard for him and a great understanding of what he achieved in a relatively short period of time in steering that Ministry.</P>
      <P>As a Minister of State in the Department of Finance, he worked to ensure that the benefits of a growing economy of additional wealth was shared equally within our community.  Given the very difficult task, one of which the Taoiseach will be aware, of negotiating bilaterals with Ministers who are ever anxious to spend more, Hugh brought an extraordinary tact to that job, ensuring there was fairness, understanding and very few rows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> He was at the prime of his political and family life.  He had so much more to offer public and political life and it is nothing short of a monumental tragedy that his life was cut short in this way.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I most sincerely offer my condolences to the Coveney family and hope the tremendous outpouring of grief will be of some comfort to them following this terrible loss.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and Deputies Owen and Howlin in expressing my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats Party to the late Hugh Coveney's widow, Pauline, his family and the Fine Gael Party.  When most of us learnt of his sudden death &mdash; in my case early on 15 March &mdash; we were deeply shocked that a person we had grown to know and admire could die in such tragic circumstances. I recall on one occasion when I was under pressure Hugh Coveney crossed the floor of the House before a debate to wish me well and offer moral and personal support.  I might have been normally surprised to receive support from an unusual quarter but not from him because he was a genuine person and decency shone through in everything he did.</P>
      <P>He detested adversarial politics, he despised partisan politics and was no prisoner to them.  I recall he made mild criticisms of a budget in which his party was involved and, equally, he praised one in which alternative parties were involved.  That was the kind of person he was.  He was a very gentle person and very shy as Deputy Owen said.  He was a busy and successful businessman, an accomplished sportsman and a happy family man.  In such circumstances many people would not enter politics but as Peter Barry said the ideal of public service motivated Hugh Coveney.  He loved Cork city and county and its people.  During the 1994 by-election, I met many people who said they supported party x or party y but were voting for Hugh Coveney.  He was highly respected and admired.</P>
      <P>Last year we held a tribute to Pearse Wyse in Cork on a Wednesday evening and Hugh Coveney came down from the Northern Ireland talks to be in attendance and returned the following morning.  He did not mind going out of his way to pay tribute to a political opponent.  He was a great ambassador for Fine Gael and politics and was the type of politician who gave politics a good name.  We are diminished by his passing as he was a gentleman in every sense.  He was a stylish, kind, courteous person on all occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall my last conversation with him when we spoke about the economy, the taxation system and about how difficult it was on occasion to get people of calibre to enter politics because of the invasion of privacy, etc.  We had a long conversation and had a great deal in common on these issues.  I had the privilege of meeting some of his seven wonderful children earlier.  Our loss is nothing in comparison with theirs and that of his <Col N="1309" /> wife, Pauline.  We understand and sympathise with them.</P>
    <P>It is significant that he died when his children were taking his boat around the world to raise money for Chernobyl.  That sums up the kind of person we are talking about.  We have lost a politician of substance who had very strong views, but notwithstanding them, he was never afraid to listen to an alternative point of view.  In his death, I hope we learn something and his legacy is that perhaps we should be more supportive of each other on occasions as sometimes the adversarial system takes over to too great an extent.  It did not in the case of Hugh Coveney who had friends all around the House.  We greatly admired and respected him and I hope his family know and understand that.</P>

      <P>Like everybody else in the House, it was with a sense of shocked disbelief that I heard first that Hugh was missing and then that he had been found dead.  Nothing we can say will help to ease the pain his wife and children feel but I hope in time the regard he is held in will help.  He is a loss to the House and Irish politics.  He was a man with enormous qualities who was sensitive, generous and open.  I like to think in the time that I got to know him not only did I learn from him but that he picked up some sense of what I was about.</P>
      <P>I came to regard him as a good friend.  He played a significant role in putting the rainbow Government together and argued strongly for the inclusion of Democratic Left because he recognised all politicians in the House have a role to play and there is no reason anyone should be excluded from Government.  He also played an enormous role in keeping that Government together through his openness, generosity and his willingness to listen to other points of view and take them on board, as the Tánaiste said.  In many respects, we came from opposites poles on the political spectrum but we also found a common purpose.  He was driven by a sense of public service and saw how that might be delivered through his politics and I through mine.</P>
      <P>The House, Irish politics, his wife, Pauline, and his children have suffered a grievous loss and the way in which he was taken from them makes it an even deeper one but I hope the sense of loss will be eased and the great respect in which he was held will help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the sad, untimely and tragic death of Hugh Coveney.  My party was not represented when he first served in the House.  Between his first election and his return in 1994 politics had changed as more parties had entered the fray and issues had also changed but it seems whatever changes occurred, they did not change Hugh Coveney who had clear ideas about politics and how they should be practised.  It was this consistent <Col N="1310" /> gentlemanly approach that has been most commented upon since his death.</P>
      <P>A mutual friend, Adi Roche, also asked me to pass on expressions of sympathy given the fantastic work his family was doing for the Chernobyl Children's Project.  She said the innocent victims of Chernobyl have lost a dear and generous friend in the tragic death of Hugh Coveney.  He was one of the most generous spirited men she ever knew, always giving generously of his time and energy.</P>
      <P>I felt there was hope for our fishing communities and the marine environment generally when Hugh Coveney was Minister for Defence and the Marine.  Many fishermen, sailors, and members of the Defence Forces feel that a light has gone out on their hopes for the future.  In the intense goldfish bowl world that is modern politics we all could learn from Hugh Coveney how to appreciate the truly important things in life, for instance one's family.  The notion of public life as public service is an important ideal which Hugh Coveney lived to the fullest.  He had been successful in practically every other aspect of life and had no need to enter public life to enhance his self image.  He could have walked away at the times when the electorate told him that others, not him, would serve them.  It was this quality of service which made him something of an enigma.  While most politicians are paranoid about their future, Hugh Coveney always gave the impression that it was an honour to serve and that other elements of his life, particularly his family, had an even greater importance.  It is they more than anyone who will miss him most.  God bless them.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <P>As a constituency colleague of the late Hugh Coveney, I extend sympathy to his family. The people of Cork have still not come to terms with the loss of Hugh Coveney.  There is an air of disbelief on the streets that our beloved city has lost such a distinguished political and sporting son.  The thousands of people who lined the streets of Cork for the removal and Mass was a very eloquent testimony to the very high esteem in which Hugh Coveney was held.  Never before was there such an outpouring across all shades of opinion in Cork as there was at the loss of this wonderful person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His abiding characteristics were gentleness, kindness and courtesy.  He always wanted to affirm the good in people.  He was not one to detract or undermine.  Never for him the cheap political gibe or publicity stunt.  He never deliberately tried to trip someone up in the conduct of his duty.  Rather he was anxious to tell a person of the good things and encourage them to press ahead with the initiatives in which they were engaged.  Obviously he had a tremendous interest in Cork and in the advancement of projects there. This stemmed from his commitment to the business and industrial life of Cork.  His love affair <Col N="1311" /> with the people of Cork began during his time as a dynamic and distinguished Lord Mayor of the city.  He and his wife Pauline were a distinguished couple and their mayoralty of Cork left a lasting impression on the public mindset.</P>
    <P>He was a very frank individual.  The first time I learned that Fianna Fáil had a chance of winning three seats in Cork South-Central during the last general election was when Hugh confided to me three months previously that his opinion polls pointed in this direction.  During the election campaign he deliberately tried to reduce his vote.  He would unquestionably have won 12,000 or 13,000 votes but he was anxious to get the right result for the Fine Gael Party.  He did this most admirably.  He was a unique politician.  As I have stated on the public airwaves, if an eager beaver young politician arrived at a church to hand out cards Hugh, calmly and with a smile on his face, would offer to move on to the next church.  The representatives of Cork South-Central will miss him as he set the tone in terms of how we behave towards one another and the relationships we enjoy.</P>
    <P>Those of us who attended the funeral ceremony will remember the wonderful nobility and courage of his family in their tributes to him.  In their eloquent contributions they showed what a wonderful family man he was.  The love for him which shone through that ceremony will long be remembered in the city of Cork.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to my former party and constituency colleague, Hugh Coveney.  The extent to which Hugh Coveney was respected is evident from the many tributes paid to him today and during the past week.</P>
      <P>I knew Hugh since I was a child as a neighbour and family friend and it was only in the 1994 by-election that I became involved in his political career.  We were both elected last year to represent Cork South-Central on behalf of Fine Gael.  That was a very proud day for me.  I had a very supportive colleague in Hugh Coveney and many of my colleagues in all parties envied the help he gave me over the past six months.</P>
      <P>The people of Cork miss Hugh Coveney and mourn his loss.  However, the greatest loss is for Pauline and his family who have lost a husband, father and friend.  They gained much from him and had some good times, but not enough.  Hugh was everybody's friend.  Everyone felt they could approach him.  No matter how trivial the request, he was always available and courteous.  As a Front Bench spokesperson he was always very helpful to new Deputies.</P>

    <P>Hugh was open and straightforward.  He had no hidden agenda; what one saw was what one got. He had a wonderful sense of public service.  He was elected to do a job and he did it in an efficient and businesslike manner.  He had great confidence in his own abilities and did not need to react to others, to undermine them or to make <Col N="1312" /> personal attacks for political gain.  He had the confidence and sense of right to do things his way.</P>
    <P>Hugh Coveney portrayed what people want of politicians, to get on with the business of representing them.  This was evident in the huge vote he received in Cork South-Central last June.  As the Minister, Deputy Martin said, his vote would have been much higher if he had not focused on trying to increase Fine Gael's representation in the city.</P>
    <P>Those of us elected to the House last June and since should never forget Hugh Coveney.  We should always carry with us his true sense of public service.</P>

      <P>During my short time as a Member I regrettably only had a few occasions to speak with Hugh Coveney.  On each occasion I had that pleasure I knew I was speaking with someone who was sincere and interested.  We shared an interest in the unfolding events in the peace process, an issue he broached with me on a number of occasions.  He struck me as a person of great character.  He showed an interest and was very much a representative of all the people who elected him to this House.</P>
      <P>His family has undoubtedly suffered the greatest loss, but I also extend my sympathy to his party colleagues.  Hugh Coveney was public spirited and interested in serving not only his constituency but also his country and his loss is felt by his family, party and all those who view this island as home.

      <P>Hugh Coveney was one of the finest people I knew.  He was a kind, gentle and unassuming man.  His simplicity was greatly admired not only by the people of Cork but by all the people.  He was a great listener and compromiser.  He was a class act and a breed apart and his contribution to the commercial and public life of Cork is unprecedented.  He was president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  He was elected to Cork Corporation as an alderman in 1979, was Lord Mayor from 1982 to 1983 and was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1981.  He was greatly admired not only by me but by the people of Cork and his death is a terrible blow not only to Cork but to Ireland.  He is a great loss to the Fine Gael Party in Cork and to his wife Pauline, his six sons and one daughter.  I am glad to see two of his sons, Simon and Rory, in the Gallery.  I extend my deepest sympathy to his family and may God grant him eternal rest.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> In page 6, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  &mdash;The Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement on the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the period of 1st January, 1998, to 31st December, 1998, within seven days of the publication of the relevant figures by the Central Statistics Office, and the statement shall compare the increases in Schedule A and Schedule B of this Act in percentage terms with the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the said period.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My concern in putting down this amendment is that there are indications of inflationary pressures, confirmed by the recently published spring 1998 report of the Central Bank of Ireland.  While the increases the Minister has given in the Social Welfare Bill are in excess of inflation, any rise in the inflation rate on which the budget was based will cut into the value of the increases given to those dependent on social welfare.  My proposal does not oblige the Government to increase levels of social welfare if inflation rises.  I would prefer to table an amendment to that effect but because of the way our business is conducted here we cannot table an amendment which obliges the Government to spend more money.</P>
    <P>My amendment simply asks the Minister to lay before the House a statement on the increase in the consumer price index for the period January 1998 to December 1998 within seven days of the publication of the relevant figures by the Central Statistics Office, and the statement shall compare the increases in Schedule A and Schedule B of this Act in percentage terms with the increase in the consumer price index for the said period. Obviously that is a less powerful amendment than a simple, straightforward one stating that the value of social welfare should be increased by the corresponding increase in the inflation rate, but this is the only amendment which would be in order.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter previously the Minister indicated that he did not expect there would be any increase in inflation in the period between now and the end of the year, but I draw his attention to page 9 of the Central Bank of Ireland Report, Spring 1998, which goes into some detail concerning the issue of inflation.  The report refers to price developments and the international and domestic economic outlook.  In regard to the inflation outlook it states:</P>
    <P>The outlook for inflation over the next year has worsened in the light of the recent overall decline in the value of the pound.  Reflecting the impact of the weaker exchange rate, the composite leading indicator points to an acceleration in inflation.  Anecdotal evidence suggests some worsening of inflation expectations and price increases for many imported goods and services.  A worsening in inflationary expectations among consumers is also reflected in the latest EU survey.  The possible emergence <Col N="1316" /> of an asset price bubble [this is a reference to the inflation in house prices] ..</P>
    <P>Taking account of a relatively benign external environment, the likely containment &mdash; at least in the short-term &mdash; of domestic inflationary pressures and the expected convergence of short-term interest rates to levels prevailing in other EU countries during 1998, it is probable that the average rate of CPI inflation will pick up through 1998, employing an average of 2 3/4 per cent.  for the year.</P>
    <P>That is significantly higher than the rate assumed by the Minister for Finance when he announced his budget.</P>
    <P>I hope the prediction is wrong for a range of reasons not least to do with the value of social welfare payments.  When we apply a social welfare increase, particularly in a period where we have enormous economic growth, income levels are rising and the quality of life for those who are working generally is improving beyond expectations, we must ensure that the standard of living of those on fixed income and those who, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to earn an income outside of social welfare, whether they be pensioners or people with disabilities, will be protected.  We all know that while our social welfare rates are generous compared to other European Union countries, they are not sufficient to ensure that people have a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report on the issue of poverty and updating the Commission on Social Welfare rates applied a number of different criteria to how an adequate income might be measured.  Depending on the mechanism applied to measure the question of an adequate income, one can estimate that between 15 per cent and 40 per cent of the population are living below a given poverty line.  We do not have time today to debate that issue but I hope the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs will get an opportunity to debate that important report.</P>
    <P>The report also raises the question of moving beyond the simple application of the 1986 recommended rates for social welfare.  Given our enormously buoyant economy and the wealth generation in this society, we need to move beyond examining our social welfare rates in terms of their value and increasing them on an annual basis beyond a simple measurement of inflation. We know that earned incomes increase significantly above the inflation rate, the net effect of which is that people on various kinds of social welfare incomes, but more particularly pensioners because of their circumstances, fall behind.  That has been the case in the past ten years or more where the value of pensions, which only increased largely in line with inflation or perhaps marginally above inflation, have fallen significantly below the value of the income people might have had when they were working.</P>
    <P>We should aim towards a level of pension which at least enables a person to live a life of some dignity.  That is the background to the <Col N="1317" /> amendment which I hope the Minister accepts.  If he is advised against incorporating the amendment into the Bill, I urge him to at least accept the proposal in principle so that we will have an idea as to how our social welfare rates are keeping pace with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>There are a range of other issues I would like to raise; I do not know if we will get the opportunity to raise them at a later stage but I have concerns about the manner in which many local authorities claw back the social welfare increases which are given.  If the Minister were to accept this proposal, at least in principle if not in the Bill, I would like him to examine the manner in which local authorities assess old age pensioners for differential rents and the proportion of social welfare increases they take from them each year. It is a mistake in policy &mdash; I have made this point in relation to other issues which arise in the Bill &mdash; for one agency of the State, the local authority, to pocket income provided by the State in general as income support.</P>
    <P>I know from experience, as I am sure does the Minister, that when we calculate increases for social welfare or for pensions we do not take claw backs into account.  We examine the existing figure and apply a rate of increase to that whether it is a percentage rate or X number of pounds of an increase.  We do not examine the impact of that on the calculation of differential rents for old age pensioners.  When I was in the Department a number of pensioners told me they did not want this increase because they felt they would not really get it, and that all we were doing was giving more money to the local authority.  That issue needs to be addressed.  If the Minister is prepared to accept my proposal I would like him to examine that issue.  Other issues need to be addressed but this matter in particular, as well as the inflation indexing of social welfare payments, need to be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has done a service to the House in tabling this amendment as it has given us an opportunity to consider the dangers of inflation and the impact of inflationary pressures, particularly on those with fixed incomes.  He said he does not expect earth shattering results but it is important to recognise the existence of such problems, which is why I support the amendment in general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are clear indications of inflationary pressures, although we cannot say how far they will develop, in the explosion in house prices. Imported inflation is probably an inevitable consequence of the exchange rate between the punt and sterling because of our high levels of imports from the UK on which there is now a surcharge of at least 20 per cent.  We must accept there are inflationary dangers and the recent revaluation will not be sufficient to contain them.  I do not have the necessary expertise to say whether those inflationary pressures will develop to the extent where they will cause a real problem.  I do not think we will have a huge problem this year but <Col N="1318" /> they could cause considerable difficulties next year.</P>
    <P>The other point is the position of those who will be worst affected by inflation.  Many people gain from inflation but those on fixed incomes do not and can be very badly affected if the inflationary pressures are too great.  That category encompasses all those who depend on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of the dangers of inflation and the fact that the social welfare increases, modest as they are, could be completely eaten away.  All the amendment seeks is to have a report tabled so that we would be aware of the problem if it arose.  It is a reasonable amendment. It does not demand any index linking, which would not be possible because such an amendment would be out of order.  The Minister should either accept the amendment or, at least, give an undertaking that if inflationary pressures were indicated along the lines signalled by Deputy De Rossa the House could debate the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us about the huge increase of £125 million in social welfare payments this year.  However, the Exchequer's income was £100 million over target for the month of January alone.  That is our fiscal situation.  I understand the broad need to contain public expenditure and to comply with Maastricht criteria and the other restrictions.  However, we must be aware of the danger that those on fixed incomes could be badly affected by inflation.  If that were to happen we should at least have the opportunity to discuss the matter in the House, which is why I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their comments.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.  However, when the Department examines the increases which are to be given at budget time cognisance is taken of the anticipated inflation rate for the coming year.  This was taken into account in the preparation of this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second and Committee Stages, the Government had a very short period in which to prepare a budget after it came into office. However, we made an early policy decision to give substantial increases, particularly to anyone over 65 years of age.  We also gave a general increase of £3 to about 566,000 people.  Given the anticipated inflation rate of 2 per cent, those general increases of between 2.2 and 4.2 per cent were real increases.  The increases in old age pensions of between 6 and 7.5 per cent were much greater than the anticipated rate of inflation. <Col N="1319" /> Cognisance was taken of the position in relation to inflation.</P>
    <P>There was also a policy view that we should give far greater increases than those given in the recent past.  I do not say that to make a political point but because, as Deputy De Rossa acknowledges, the payments made to older members of society who rely on social welfare have fallen behind over the years.  We made a decision to increase those payments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk up the issue of inflation during a discussion on social welfare.  However, and I do not say this as a defence, there is no doubt that the rates of increase in the recent budget are way in excess of anything given in recent years.  The rates of increase are proofed against even a substantial rise in inflation because there is quite an amount of leeway in the figures in that respect.  At the end of the day, it boils down to pounds, shillings and pence for those in receipt of the increases and I accept they do not look at percentages.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe will probably not acknowledge that the increases are substantial but the £125 million package is there for all to see.  We decided to spread that package and give substantial increases to the areas we considered to be most in need.  We could have spread the money more broadly, across the spectrum and included other initiatives, but we decided as a matter of policy that a sizeable amount of money would be put into old age pensions while not forgetting general increases for others.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy De Rossa's remarks regarding the local authorities.  It has always been a source of discontent among members of the public that moneys provided by my Department in the budget can be clawed back.  Deputies are aware of this.  We have been in contact with the local authorities on the question of FIS and the calculation of the differential rent.  Ultimately however, the decision on differential rents by the local authorities is based on guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa will appreciate the frustration involved in finding that, after fighting for the maximum resources available, a claw back can be operated by others.  This does not only apply to the local authorities.  The effect of the claw back is to reduce the benefit of the increase provided to people.  That is wrong and I will look at any areas where this happens to try to ensure that people really benefit from the increases allocated to them.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the purpose of the amendment I cannot accept it.  Amending the Bill is not the right way to proceed.  However, perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs could monitor the issue and submit its views.  Matters will become clearer as the year progresses and the question of inflation will then have to be considered when preparing the budget for the following year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  The amendment is unusual and it is not essential that it be incorporated in the Bill.  However, it would be an important service to the House if he was to agree, at a minimum, that such a report would be presented to the House when the CSO publishes its report on the level of inflation.</P>
      <P>The increases we are approving in the Bill will not be given until June and will probably run until the June 1999 less whatever few weeks the Minister manages to bring them forward.  Even allowing for that, I do not anticipate that he will be able to close the gap by six months in the next budget.</P>
      <P>Even if there is higher inflation towards the end of this year, people will have to pay more for their food and services for a period of up to six months before the next increases are given.  In view of this, it would make sense if the report proposed by this amendment were to be made available.  It would strengthen the Minister's hand when negotiating with his colleagues on the kind of money his Department needs to assist those on fixed incomes and who have no other way of earning incomes.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to present a report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs on the trends in inflation and the impact they will have on social welfare rates?  He may have good news in that the rate of inflation may be declining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In percentage terms a rise of £3 represents increases ranging from between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.  The real increase would be between 2.2 per cent and 2.6 per cent based on anticipated inflation of 2 per cent.  A rise of £5 represents a real increase of between 4.4 per cent and 5.4 per cent.  The increases we provided this year were well ahead of the anticipated rate of inflation.  For example, in 1995, the real increase was 0 per cent; the rate of inflation was 2.5 per cent and the increase provided was 2.5 per cent. In 1996 the rate of inflation was 1.7 per cent while the real increase in social welfare was 1.3 per cent.  In 1997 the rate of inflation was 1.4 per cent which provided for a real increase of 2.6 per cent. By comparison with the figures for the previous three years, the rates of between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent with regard to the rise of £3 per week and of between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent with regard to the rise of £5 per week illustrate the real increases that were provided.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to give any hostages to fortune regarding the ultimate rate of inflation, the differential between what we anticipated and the percentage increase we provided allows for plenty of leeway.  I will accede to any request from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Family and Community Affairs to discuss the issue and assist it in its deliberations.  I may have a good news story to tell.</P>

      <P>I would prefer if the Minister agreed to produce a report on the trend in <Col N="1321" /> inflation.  I will not debate rates of increase in previous years.  If a 10 per cent increase was provided this year across the board it would still not bring social welfare rates to a level which would enable people to live with dignity.  That is the sad reality. The rates in the past have been increased on an inflation basis and have not been related to the cost of living in terms of the people's standards of living and their potential earnings in the workforce.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.  -The Minister shall prepare a report on the measures required to close the differential between the rates of periodical benefits and rates of periodical social assistance paid to a beneficiary and the rates paid to a qualified adult, and he shall lay the report before each House of the Oireachtas not later than six months from the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a device to have the issue of individualisation of rates brought to the floor of the House. What I am talking about is the gap between what is sometimes referred to as the main rate and the rate paid to an adult dependant.  If I am claiming unemployment assistance and my spouse is a dependant, she is paid the qualified adult rate. There are strong arguments in equity and in equality for giving the dependants of claimants the same rate of payment as the main beneficiary. From the statistics the Minister gave us on Committee Stage, it is clear the differential is growing and the qualified adult rate has declined as a proportion of the main rate.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the adult dependant rate should be a minimum of 60 per cent of the main rate.  Some of the qualified adult rates are in excess of that, although not greatly so at around 62 per cent or 63 per cent.  Unfortunately, the rates are declining.  To relieve the Minister of the task of reminding me, it is not just this year they declined.  They declined in previous years as well. For policy reasons Ministers tend to concentrate on the main rates, on putting resources into certain areas, whether carer's benefit, child benefit or whatever, and then allocate resources as best they can across the other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to be serious about the issue of the qualified adult.  For years there has been pressure to eliminate gender discrimination from our social welfare system.  The major advance in that respect was made by way of European Union directives, but these were not properly implemented in this country and this resulted in many court cases and, eventually, in married women achieving success and being paid something like £260 million which was due to them. Had the European Union directives been <Col N="1322" /> implemented correctly in the first place, the estimated cost would have been about £18 million.</P>
    <P>There are issues not only of equity but of cost. If we continue to treat the qualified adult in this discriminatory way, we will face court challenges. I do not know the proportions, but I am sure that in excess of 90 per cent of qualified adults are women, generally married women working in the home.  Some of them may have part-time jobs, but that would not be a significant proportion.  There is a case for looking seriously at the issue of individualisation of rates.  There has been pressure over the years to eliminate discrimination against women in our social welfare code.  The EU directives went a long way towards that.  In terms of language, and in most if not all schemes, we have eliminated any discriminatory aspects of qualifying criteria for social welfare, but there is still this distinction between the main beneficiary and the qualified adult where the qualified adult gets only approximately 60 per cent, perhaps a bit more or a bit less, of what the main claimant is receiving.</P>
    <P>All kinds of benefits would result from individualisation of rates.  It would be costly and there are major policy implications involved in going down that route, but it is time we began to look at it.  It is the next step in terms of equality in our society as it relates to social welfare.  I would like at the very least to see a policy of increasing the proportion of the qualified adult rate gradually over a period of years to bring it closer to the main rate.  It may take a long time to reach the target of complete individualisation, but we should at least make a decision to head in that direction.  One way of doing that would be to monitor the qualified adult rate when we apply our annual social welfare increases.  In that way the issue would be upfront all the time and we would be able to argue for or against what was happening.  It is only on the basis of hard information that we can make rational arguments in this House for or against policy options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put forward by Deputy De Rossa and agree with most of what he said.  What he said could be extended further in the context of two young people in receipt of unemployment assistance who are supposedly living separately.  If they get married one of them becomes an adult dependant, thus reducing their overall income by between £20 and £25 a week, which is a substantial amount of money.  Many young people would say that is a disincentive to marriage.  The Minister may say that if they are living together and getting the full amount, one of them is making a false declaration, and that is so, but if one were to examine the situation in many large housing estates one would find that this is cited as a disincentive to marriage.  Knowing the Minister's background and his commitment to the family, I am sure he would be anxious that the Government should encourage the institution of marriage, and this is one of the bars that prevent a small number of people from getting married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> There is another point associated with this.  A constituent of mine spoke to me yesterday about increases in social welfare pensions resulting from the budget.  She is an adult dependant on her husband's allowance, and she was a little bit upset that he, as the pensioner, was going to get an increase of £5 on his pension but that she, as an adult dependant, would not get the same level of increase.  If she had her own pension payment, she would have received an increase of £5.  She felt that because she was a wife and an adult dependant she was not being treated fairly under the social welfare code.  The lady is in her seventies and I was surprised at how upset she was and how vigorously she pressed her case.</P>
    <P>This relates to the point made by Deputy De Rossa.  There is a need to equalise the system. Most adult dependants are women and they are treated as second class citizens.  I understand the huge financial implications involved but perhaps there is a way round it, such as a household allowance with adults treated individually and at the same level.  We must move towards a position where everybody is treated equally under the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because women are particularly affected by this issue.  The majority of adult dependants are women who stayed at home to look after their families and who do not have any contributions in their own right.  In common with Deputy McGrath, I received representations from a woman recently on this matter which arose following the £5 increase in the budget for old age pensioners.  This increase is welcome but married pensioners presumed they would receive £10.  The woman wanted to apply for her own old age pension.  She did not understand that her husband had contributions and she did not have any contributions.  I appreciate that pensioners received a large increase this year but the possibility of paying women pensions equal to those of their husbands should be considered.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of a case involving a woman who had stamps and sought an invalidity pension. She was most aggrieved because she was asked on the application form how much money she had in the bank, etc.  A number of anomalies in the system need to be examined, particularly the equalisation of pension payments.  I presume this would cost a great deal of money; the Minister probably has the figures.  Perhaps the Oireachtas Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs in conjunction with the Minister should consider how equalisation of pension payments could be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the points made by the Deputies.  The general 3 per cent increase in qualified adult allowances, which will be paid from June, will involve increases ranging from 56 per cent to 68.6 per cent of the relevant personal <Col N="1324" /> rate of payment.  The increases for those on long-term social assistance, with the exception of invalidity pension for those over the age of 65 or in excess of 60 per cent of the personal rate, and short-term social insurance payments will amount to 58.4 per cent of the relevant personal rate. Treatment of married or cohabiting couples and one parent households under the tax and social welfare systems is being examined by the interdepartmental working group established by my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, in May last year. This group, which is chaired by my Department, will submit its report later this year.</P>
      <P>The issue of the individualisation of payments was raised on Committee Stage.  I undertook to have the matter examined, but it will take considerable time.  I inherited a tradition which developed over the years where all my predecessors, irrespective of political party, increased the full personal rate for the relevant spouse in the household.  There are a number of ways to address this issue.  One would be to aggregate the total current payment and divide it in two. However, the fact that previous Ministers did not do so is testimony to the point that if such a move was made, the Minister would be subject to the wrath of male social welfare recipients and old age pensioners.  The alternative is to implement the various suggestions over a long period.  Equalisation could take place by substantially raising the qualified adult allowance but this would cost a huge amount of money.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Oireachtas Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs could consider this matter and make suggestions.  I would then consider proposals in the context of a future budget.  However, I do not have figures on the cost of equalising qualified adult allowance payments.  I accept Deputies did not seek that because it would be asking for the impossible. However, some people are aggrieved by the current position and I also received representations about the matter.  This puts into context the point I made regarding amendment No. 1.  Substantial increases were given in the budget and people in receipt of qualified adult allowance are aggrieved because the differential between the personal and qualified adult allowance rates is much more stark as a result.</P>
      <P>However, that is the consequence of the decision to positively discriminate in favour of those on social welfare over the age of 66 years and on the personal rate.  In an ideal world it would be lovely to be in a position to proportionally increase the qualified adult allowance. However, everything was not possible in the budget package that was available.  I accept this area needs to be examined and perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs and my Department officials will bear it in mind in their future deliberations.</P>

      <P>The Minister's point about aggregating the main rate and qualified adult <Col N="1325" /> allowance payments and dividing it in two might appear attractive at first glance.  However, the effect of this would be that individual recipients living alone would be on a lower rate.  This would be unfair and discriminatory.  Therefore, the only way to achieve individualisation is to raise the qualified adult rate.  The theory behind a lower rate for qualified adults as opposed to the main rate is that it is assumed it is cheaper for two to live together than one to live alone.  I do not know if the evidence sustains that argument any longer.  That was believed to be the case when the commission published its report in 1985-86 and recommended that the adult dependant allowance &mdash; as it was then known &mdash; should be no less than 60 per cent of the main rate.  I have a vague recollection that a more recent report questioned the theory of two being cheaper than one.  Nevertheless, we need to address this unfair treatment of qualified adults who, because of the nature of our society are mainly women, many of whom are married.  It has already been stated that some people choose not to inform the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that they are living together because of the fear of losing the two main rates and ending up with a 1.6 per cent rate.  This would place them in a limbo and cause great difficulties for the Department.  The Minister should seriously consider bringing the qualified adult rate closer to the main rate.</P>

      <P>The Minister quoted statistics which do not bear up under a total examination of child benefit.  As Disraeli once said, &ldquo;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.&rdquo; When the Minister talked about the percentage increases provided for in the Bill he did not refer to an increase for child dependants.  He was not able to do so because that allowance was not increased.  Most people agree that child support should be expressed through child benefit rather than child dependant allowances.  While I do not disagree with that established dictum, I would point out what we should do in respect of child benefit.  If the Minister uses the consensus in that respect as an excuse for not increasing the allowance, there must be a much more liberal approach to child benefit.  That is the background to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Child care should be a priority.  That is why I pressed this amendment on Committee Stage and tabled it again on Report Stage.  The amount of increase provided in the Bill for child care generally is inadequate.  In the short reign of the rainbow Government child benefit was increased by 60 per cent while under this Bill there will be a very modest increase of approximately 37.5 pence per week which will apply from next September. That is the only provision for child care.</P>
      <P>A further initiative is necessary to provide real additional child care support for families with pre-school children.  There is scope for this in the context of this Bill because of the failure to increase the child dependant allowance and the very modest increase in child benefit from the end of the year.  Against that background, I propose that there should be a parent's child care supplement of £360 per annum payable in the same way as child benefit.  This would amount to less than £1 per day and would apply to all children under five.  In a pre-budget submission on behalf of Fine Gael I stated that I would be satisfied if this initiative was introduced on a phased basis.  I appreciate the cost tag would be considerable if it were introduced initially for all children up to five years.  It could be paid in respect of one and two year olds in 1998 and extended to cover all children up to the age of five in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another advantage of child benefit that cannot be underestimated is that it is normally paid to mothers.  In many cases it is the only independent source of income they receive.  Unfortunately, there are many selfish fathers who are not prepared to live up to their family responsibilities, <Col N="1327" /> particularly when there are a number of children involved.</P>
    <P>That is why I phrase it to seek a report on this issue.  I am interested in the actual costing, on which there was a difference of opinion on Committee Stage.  I did my calculations on the basis of approximately 50,000 children born each year. The figures produced by the Minister were somewhat higher.  Will he give a commitment to consider this initiative?  If he gives favourable and positive consideration to the introduction of such an initiative, in time he may be remembered as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who made an appreciable difference to the quality of child care.  I do not seek to have my name associated with it.  I would be happy if the Minister took credit for it and announced that he is prepared to accept it and adopt it as his own.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, has set out clearly the thinking behind this amendment and has made a strong case for a parent's child supplement to be paid to the mothers of children under five years of age.  Children in that age group do not receive a great deal of State support in terms of school costs and so on.  Those who have additional help at that age will reap the reward later.</P>
      <P>It is important that this supplement be paid through the child benefit scheme.  It is interesting that 58 per cent of mothers who receive child benefit have it as their only source of income.  If we want to get money directly to the mothers of children, it should be channelled through the child benefit scheme.  On Committee Stage we haggled about the costings which amounted to approximately £17 million or £18 million per annum.  This would have to be multiplied by five if it were to be paid for five years.  If this were phased in it would be a worthwhile additional benefit to the parents of young children.  The Minister's broad remit includes not only social welfare but families.  Will he take this amendment on board and have a thorough look at what can be done in that area?  There is an even greater need for support for families at this time, especially those with children of pre-school age.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I support this amendment which calls on the Minister to consider the introduction of a parent's child care supplement of £360 per annum for all children up to the age of five years, to be paid directly to the mother through the child benefit scheme.  It is recognised that the earlier years of children are expensive for parents.  Given that in most cases it is the mother who is required to make provision for the child, this supplement would be of special assistance to mothers.  As well as asking the Minister to accept this amendment I ask him to look again at child benefit for twins.  The Minister should go the whole distance in providing 200 per cent to families with twins.  There was an injustice here.  The Minister went half the way towards <Col N="1328" /> recognising that injustice as compared to the treatment of triplets and so on.  I invite him to sponsor the two amendments ruled out because of Standing Orders.  The birth of twins imposes a huge charge on families and puts an extra strain on parents.  In the event of multiple births of two or three, costs are not only doubled but there are extra costs involved for various reasons.  The State is backward in providing cre ches for child care.  While finance is not everything it is of enormous assistance; the amount involved would be small.  While Standing Orders do not allow Deputies make proposals that may impose a charge on the Exchequer I could point out where the revenue could be found.  As a corollary to the extra cost, one could reverse the cut in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, which benefits only the superrich and speculators, and give it to the mothers of children.</P>

We are all aware of mothers, whether in the private sector or on social welfare, who have irresponsible husbands who do not provide for their children.

    </Speaker>
    <P>However the constraints of Report Stage do not allow us to expand and explore the amendment as we would wish.  I am aware the Minister has cost constraints.  A change of mind set and attitude is required to child care and equality.  Even if this has to be done on a phased basis, it can be done with a certain confidence because the buoyancy of the economy and tax revenue will allow us to do it.  A modest step in the right direction would allow women to make choices in the home. We have an idyllic picture of rosy cheeked children and a mother who wishes to spend all her time with them.  For many reasons it would be positive for both the mother and children if the accommodation and resources were available to allow the children to attend a cre che or child care centre in which the mother might also be involved. <Col N="1329" /> At present, there is a two tier system.  If people have sufficient money, they can use it to give their children the social and intellectual start which is recognised as an extraordinarily positive beginning with regard to equality of opportunity for children.  However, the mothers and children who need that start most are those who can least afford it.  As legislators, we must begin to tackle that inequality and that is the objective of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath quoted the staggering statistic that the sole, independent income of 58 per cent of women with children is child benefit.  That is a cold figure which reflects a huge amount of poverty and a lack of recognition of what women, as mothers, do.  Is a policy being developed in the medium term with regard to the recommendations of the Commission on the Family and the working group on child care?  Can that be a support mechanism for the Minister in seeking Government decisions to increase budgets to meet the requirements of amendments such as this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is essential that financial supports for child care be developed.  However, we should not simply discuss the issue of payment for child care.  It should not just be a matter of giving money to parents to buy child care.  We should examine the issue of child care in its broadest context.  The parent who remains in the home to care for the child is equally as in need of support as the parent who goes outside the home to work and needs to buy child care for the period he or she might be employed.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of developing child benefit as a means of supporting children in society.  It should be sufficient to enable parents to do that, whether they remain at home on a shared basis to care for children or one spouse chooses to stay at home or both take up employment outside the home and need to employ a child care service. Numerous studies have shown that the child benefit system is the most effective means of tackling the issue of child poverty in society. There is no longer any debate about this finding and it is simple to find out why it is the case.  Child benefit is not clawed back in any way.  It cannot be clawed back by local authorities in the same way as pension, unemployment benefit or family income supplement increases can be clawed back. No end of trouble will be caused if local authorities ever attempt to include child benefit in their assessments for differential rents or other benefits.</P>
      <P>The only time child benefit is taken into account for State supports is in the case of legal aid, and we should insist that the Legal Aid Board end that practice.  It cuts into the principle that child benefit should never be taxed. However, when people seek free legal aid to go to court to protect their rights, they are essentially taxed on their child benefit.  That is wrong and we should draw attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> Child benefit is not taxed by the Revenue Commissioners and it is not clawed back by way of grants from local authorities if a recipient seeks a housing grant which is means tested.  It is also not taxed if one returns to work after having been unemployed, unlike child dependent allowances. I am pleased the Minister continued the innovation of the last Government which froze child dependent allowances and gave significant increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin spoke earlier about the anomalous situation that arose when the main beneficiaries of such allowances, who are usually male, complained bitterly when child dependent allowances were not increased but child benefit was.  The increase did not come in his cheque but went directly into the pocket or purse of his spouse.  There are probably good reasons in many cases for such complaints but child benefit is a payment which goes directly to women.  It is given to every parent who has a child and it is the nearest thing this country has to a basic income.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we should examine the possibility of developing and increasing the child benefit system to a point where it can give adequate support for rearing children.  Numerous reports over many decades have shown that it is the best way to deliver support for children.  On that basis, I wholeheartedly support the amendment.  It deals with child care and I have no problem with that.</P>
    <P>If child benefit was sufficiently enhanced it would enable people to buy child care where they need it.  It is a better way for the State to deliver support for child care than through the tax system.  Britain has introduced a tax allowance for child care and many people argue for its introduction here.  However, we must distinguish between a tax allowance on a person's income which enables him to purchase child care, which I believe is wrong and would be an inequitable way of delivering support, and the need to examine how people involved in child care are taxed. Thousands of people who are paid to provide child care are working in the informal economy. It is not financially worthwhile for them to come into the tax or PRSI system.  That issue must be seriously examined.  As it is a hidden industry, it is extremely difficult to regulate and we are, therefore, leaving it open to all types of dangerous practices.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, when examining the issue of child care, to concentrate his efforts on increasing child benefit and to forget the Fianna Fáil promise to introduce a tax allowance for child care.  Tax allowances will not benefit those who are not at work or those who are working for low pay.  It will only benefit people who are on high levels of pay.  The more tax a person pays, the more he or she will benefit from a tax allowance for child care.  However, that would be anomalous because, by definition, if somebody is on a high income, he or she can afford to buy child care. The person at the other end of the income ladder is the person who is most in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> The delivery of child care in a fair and equitable way for all children should be through child benefit.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions.  It is one of the major issues facing our changing society which has changed dramatically in the last two decades.  All political parties are of the view that it must be addressed but there are differing opinions on what should be done.

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the report of the Commission on the Family which is due to be published shortly.  It received more submissions than any previous similar State commission.  One in three referred to the issue of child care.  The commission asked the ESRI to conduct a national survey of child care arrangements.  The preliminary findings indicate that one in three or 77,000 pre-school children experience periods of care outside the home and away from their parents for part of the week.  A total of 75 per cent or 99,000 children under the age of two are cared for in the home by a parent.  A total of 13 per cent or 13,200 children under the age of two are cared for by a childminder in the childminder's home.  Almost 20 per cent or 21,600 of children between the ages of two and three at home with a parent attend a nursery, cre che or other pre-school service.  A total of 99 per cent of five year olds and almost 50 per cent of four year olds &mdash; not surprisingly &mdash; attend primary school. The experience in many European countries is that children start school later.  The results of the <Col N="1332" /> survey indicate a varied approach among families to the care of young children.  The report of the commission will be a starting point for the expert working group established under Partnership 2000 under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>This is one of three major issues facing our society.  The others are the ageing profile of the population and disability.  Irrespective of who is in Government, they will have to be looked at closely.  We must start planning for the future.</P>
    <P>We indicated in our election manifesto and the programme for Government that, if at all possible, we would address the issue of a tax allowance for stay-at-home spouses &mdash; generally females &mdash; who give up their careers to rear their children.  We also indicated that we would address the issue of a tax allowance to assist couples working outside the home with the cost of child care in registered cre ches.  These issues are being examined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I could be political and ask why the Deputies opposite did not address this issue when in Government but I will not go down that road.  It is an issue which will have to be dealt with on a broad front.  I accept what Deputy De Rossa said, that tax allowances alone are not the cure.  There are differing opinions.  On the radio programme mentioned people from all walks of life and backgrounds expressed their views on how the issue should be addressed from their perspective but the Government and the social partners have to take a broader view.</P>
    <P>As regards what Deputy De Rossa said about the Legal Aid Board assessing child benefit, we should take that issue up with the Legal Aid Board or the Department responsible for it and I undertake to do that.  Members are aware why I cannot accept the amendment.  I acknowledge that not only my Department but other agencies must look at the area of child care in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The issue of child benefit as opposed to child dependant allowance was accepted by the previous Government and followed by me since I took office.  The freezing of child dependant allowances is the right thing to do because child benefit is, as other speakers said, the best way of getting to the core of child poverty.  It will ensure that the female spouse gets money into her hand. It is well established that the best way to direct resources to children is through child benefit and I will continue that practice as long as I am Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he will address the issue of the Legal Aid Board taking child benefit into account.  I am worried that this could be used in the future as the thin end of the wedge in relation to other qualifying criteria for support and public services.  When I was the Minister for Social Welfare I sought to have it dealt with by the Department responsible for the Legal Aid Board but, unfortunately, I did not succeed.  I wish the Minister <Col N="1333" /> well and I will write to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister's heart is in the right place and if he was not on a leash from the Minister for Finance he would make some decent progress on child care, particularly in relation to child benefit.  I listened carefully to some of the points the Minister made about what is in the programme for Government on this issue.</P>
      <P>There seems to be common ground on all sides of the House about improving the lot of children and a common view that child benefit is preferable to increasing child dependant allowance. There may not be common ground on tax allowances and tax relief.  I am worried about an approach which involves tax relief.  It is not that I am against tax relief but there is a danger that if one focuses on tax allowances it may discriminate against the stay-at-home mother and those at the lower end of the tax scale while favouring the well off or those on substantial incomes.  Is that the right approach?  The UK is looking at that approach at present.  Perhaps the Minister might examine how it works there.  We should follow the tried and trusted approach of child benefit. As my colleague, Deputy McGrath, said, child benefit is the income of a substantial percentage of mothers.  Increases could be made under any of the headings of child benefit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins mentioned a particular approach close to my heart when he spoke about multiple births.  Consideration should be given to a child care benefit supplement for pre-school children.  I take the Minister's point that our children go to school much earlier than those on the Continent.  In some continental countries they do not go to school until the age of six or seven, whereas children here go at four years of age. There are special costs before that happens whether or not the mother is working.</P>
      <P>I would like to press the amendment to a vote to indicate how strongly I believe in it but I do not want to hold up the debate as we only have limited time.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to return to this issue in the future.</P>

    <P>One of the bouquets I gave the Minister is the fact that family income supplement is now payable on net income.  A step towards that was taken in the previous Social Welfare Bill which was introduced by Deputy De Rossa.  I support the Minister in taking that a step further. However, there is now greater discrimination against the self-employed.  The self-employed, who cannot qualify for family income supplement, are painted as the fat cats of our society. That attitude to self-employment must be changed.  Traditionally, many self-employed people survived on a low income.  Many farmers, for example, are self-employed and they do not have big incomes.  I remember asking a constituent for a description of a small farmer and I was told it was a farmer with more children than cows. They are not all in that category.  We must consider that category of self-employed people as well as those who own small shops in our cities, towns and villages.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to thank my Front Bench colleagues for supporting this Bill.  Its purpose is to introduce a central registration scheme for those who work as door supervisors, also commonly known as bouncers.  The Bill sets out to address the main problem areas in this sector, those of violence and assault, drugs and the black economy.  I have great pleasure in introducing Second Stage of this Bill and I thank all those who helped me to get this far, especially those who went to great lengths to further my knowledge of how serious this problem has become.  I have established the extent of this problem with a substantial number of door staff or bouncers and I was motivated to act on this problem by the harrowing complaints made by many young people and their parents from my constituency who had attended discos.  I was fortunate to be interviewed on this issue on Pat Kenny's show where I supported the call to introduce the licensing of bouncers to address the issue of the increasing number of assaults.  Since then the information and help I received has justified my belief in the need to introduce a Bill such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Newspapers are full of reports of the bad conduct of bouncers who are not accountable and can simply disappear into the night.  Few cases are <Col N="1335" /> brought to court.  Mr. Justice Tom Fitzpatrick on fining a bouncer £500 in a private prosecution was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 October 1997 as saying that many security men were not properly trained and too many thought their function was to punish people for a disturbance they might have caused rather than simply ejecting them.</P>
    <P>From my information drug abuse is one of the most alarming aspects of the problem.  Most of the information I have on bouncers is anecdotal. However, Professor Dick Hobbs from the University of Durham said that when bouncers were instructed to search arriving punters and confiscate drugs the doormen moved into the business, initially they were paid off by dealers who were granted entrance to events and were able to operate a monopoly, later they merely confiscated everybody's drugs, set up their own dealership and there was seldom any trouble at those events because they were protecting profits, not merely reputations.</P>
    <P>The same model applies here.  We are not on top of the problem.  I congratulate the Garda who have been successful in recent months in closing two drug dens in the capital.  Most bouncers or doormen operate in the black economy.  A large amount of money is being moved in this sector and the loss of State revenue is probably in the region of millions.  I have been told special concessions have been given by Revenue officials to some operators in this business, which gives them an unfair advantage over others that operate legitimately.  These problems stem from abuse of a position of authority and trust.  This problem can be compared to a runaway train and it must be stopped.  Our young people need protection from this abuse and it must be provided by way of appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought some of my findings to the attention of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  She asked me to meet heads of the Irish security industry who have been calling for similar licensing for the past 20 years.  I did that, but the industry decided to distance itself from the area of bouncers.  When I reported to the then Minister on the many meetings we had on the issue, she decided to set up a consultative group on the private security industry.  However, I told her at the time I was disappointed there was no representative from the area of bouncers or doormen on that group.  Those events galvanised me to produce this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is support for the need to introduce a Bill, such as this one, from all quarters.  The public have voiced their support through the media. Dance hall licence holders have offered support through the Irish Dance Hall Association which has approximately 140 members.  Doormen have confided in me that a clean up is well overdue. Nobody has said this Bill is not needed.  I have been informed by some senior security people who operate legitimate businesses in this area that they have been threatened in any attempt they have made to introduce regulations in this <Col N="1336" /> area and they expressed concern about the welfare of anyone who would be prepared to stand up and be counted.  Dirty money voices are powerful.  I trust the Minister will have the mettle to stand up and oppose them.</P>
    <P>I do not know the Government's or the Minister's view on this legislation, but the Minister is the last person in this House who should oppose it given that he and his leader, the Taoiseach, went to the country with a policy on zero tolerance of crime no later than eight or nine months ago.  It would be very beneficial to our young people if this Bill were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 5 deal with the interpretation of definitions and the appointment of an authorised officer and inspector.  Section 6 provides for the creation of a register of door supervisors and an authorised officer who shall maintain the said register and his or her role shall be purely administrative.  Sections 7, 8 and 9 cover the requirement for a certificate of personal fitness issued by the local Garda authority, an appeal regarding the refusal of which shall be made the District Court.  Auctioneers, bookmakers and taxi drivers are familiar with this concept.</P>
    <P>Every guard dog needs a special licence and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regulates that provision on a continuous basis.  Is it not odd that the dog handler in the security industry does not?</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11 and 12 deal with applications to be included on the register.  Section 13 makes it an offence to act as or to employ an unregistered door supervisor.  Section 14 covers regulations which deal with the form of a certificate of registration or licence with records to be kept &mdash; these will be of great help to the Garda and tax authorities &mdash; and standards of qualifications on training for people who want to work on special events.  Section 15 deals with penalties for noncompliance.  It is important when legislation is introduced that penalties are included for noncompliance, on the one hand for the individual who is prepared to work but does not go through the training to apply for the licence, and on the other for the owners of licensed premises to ensure their licences will be revoked in the event of them not employing registered doormen. There will be a need to amend the licensing laws if this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides the public with the comfort that their complaints will receive proper attention.  The final section gives inspectors and the Garda the power to enter any licensed premises to make sure all matters provided for in the Bill are in order.  There is no point in introducing rules, regulations and licensing without providing the means to enforce them.  A register, which would be available on a nightly basis of those who are properly trained, is the way to protect people attending such premises.  Everyone would like to think their children are protected when they attend such premises. <Col N="1337" /> I costed the Bill using Department of Finance guidelines.  The cost of five staff in central locations using the latest computer systems would be covered, with a surplus, by an annual licence fee of only £10.  That fee can include the provision of a laminated card with a photograph which can be used by the individuals involved.  Recovered PAYE and PRSI contributions would leave a large surplus which could be used to licence the entire security industry.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the Bill would include improved public safety and confidence; it would lead to cleaning up or closing of criminally controlled venues; it would be self financing and generate revenue; it would raise the standards of professionalism up to the year 2000 and beyond and tackle the black economy.  The Bill on its introduction would provide openness, traceability, accountability and badly needed protection for young people.</P>
    <P>A similar Private Members' Bill is to be introduced in the House of Commons.  Would it be nice for the Minister to lead rather than be led?  Since I published the Bill in December 1997 I monitored the media's interest in this area.  I remind the Minister that in January 1998 a man was shot dead in Finglas while stun grenades were used in a luxury apartment at 6 a.m. in Dublin city centre and gardaí were shot and wounded, the result of a turf war over door security.  Many unsavoury practices are said not to exist until there is in-fighting.  The veil of secrecy comes down with regular monitoring of various media reports on the transgressions of bouncers.</P>
    <P>The problem is real and I have zero tolerance of this young person's issue.  I hope the Minister as a parent first and politician second feels like I do.  I fear the Bill will be dumped along with the report of the consultative group on the private security industry published in January 1998 and the fourth report of the select committee on crime, lawlessness, vandalism and control of the private security industry, of which the Taoiseach was a member in 1984.  As a result of complacency 14 years of work has gone into the industry and nothing has been achieved to date. All these reports call for licensing and control, yet there has been no action.  The legislative programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for 1998 and 1999 which was circulated recently does not refer to any proposals to introduce licensing in the security industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not let this opportunity to introduce badly needed legislation pass him by. How many more tragedies must take place before he will be forced to introduce similar laws?  On 11 February 1997 Garda chiefs were quoted in newspaper articles under headlines &ldquo;Discos Must Prohibit Drug Use&rdquo;.  Nothing happened following this.  A report was commissioned by the North Eastern Health Board and 1,100 secondary school students aged between 12 and 17 were interviewed.  More than 35 per cent of them who attended discos said they were offered drugs.  In <Col N="1338" /> many cases the people on the doors know what is happening and there is a concerted effort to pressurise young people into taking drugs as money is given by drug barons to doormen to turn a blind eye and allow pushers in.  That situation gave me the impetus over the past 12 months to introduce this Bill.  Young people are under enough pressure to pass examinations and secure employment without additional pressure being put on them.  We have a duty to enact legislation which will put this industry back on track and ensure that those who are supposed to protect young people in the event of adversity will do so.</P>
    <P>In recent months a number of cases have highlighted the problems in this area.  As recently as last week an Oireachtas employee saw a person being pulled out of a club by a bouncer.  No person should have this power without being answerable to someone.  This practice has gone on for too long and Ministers have not had the bottle to deal with it.  This legislation, if accepted, can become the foundation for licensing the security industry which employs 16,500 doormen and thousands of people in other areas.  I have attended nine meetings at which 12 security firms were represented.  They raised with me the question of illegitimate firms which under price them for many jobs, including Government jobs.  The members of the industry want rules and regulations so that people will work within the system on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Last night a member of one company gave me a substantial amount of information which enlightened me further.  When I referred to the need for a level playing pitch he said they were all off the pitch scrambling, fighting and undercutting each other.  He also said that at least 70 per cent of the people working in the business, particularly in the larger towns and cities, do this because they control the drugs brought into clubs. If the Bill stops the use of drugs in clubs then we will have done a good day's work by accepting it.</P>
    <P>Our purpose is to provide help where there are problems and to introduce legislation which the Government does not have time to introduce. The Minister should not say there is no problem in this area.  If zero tolerance means anything it surely means that people should be able to enjoy themselves in night clubs without being harassed. Even if some people are in the wrong, bouncers should not be entitled to take the law into their own hands.  The reason laws are on the Statute Book is to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands.  Parents, children and those working in the industry want the industry to be cleaned up so that there will be a level playing pitch.  I want the same rules and regulations to apply to everyone.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition he preached about the great measures he would implement in the area of justice on return to Government.  I was a member of the Government at the time and thought he went over the top on many occasions.  Many people will say that is politics.  However, the ball is now in his court and he <Col N="1339" /> can accept this Bill.  With all due respect to them, the officials in the Department have been moving the deck-chairs for 20 years and have not pushed a Minister to produce legislation in this area.  The Minister now has the opportunity to enact this legislation.  The Bill will clean up this industry and ensure that what happened in 1996 and 1997 and is continuing to happen on a larger scale will be brought to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time.  I compliment Deputy Farrelly on introducing this long awaited Bill which I hope the Minister accepts.  If it needs to be changed, amendments can be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Many bouncers think that because they wear a uniform they are like Al Capone, are above the law and can savagely beat up people.  As Deputy Farrelly said, the law is there to deal with people who step out of line.  It is not a matter for these people who think they are like Al Capone.  They should be recruited to the Army and sent abroad where I am sure there is a place for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly referred to zero tolerance.  I believe in law and order and that the law should apply equally to everyone.  Will the Minister refer to the new zero tolerance policy being implemented in Connacht and Clare in relation to the licensing laws?  The Minister has attacked publicans in rural areas and directed the Garda to put people out of public houses.  This pilot scheme should apply to the entire country.  If the scheme related to tax breaks the west would not be included.  Why has the Minister targeted the west and rural pubs?  If he had targeted discos I would support him.  The law should apply across the board and there should be no variation in the implementation of the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>The closing time should be the same for all establishments.  However, we now have the crazy situation where public houses close at a certain time, discos close at a later time and clubs close even later.  As Deputy Farrelly said, that is why we have problems with bouncers.  People leave pubs and go to clubs and discos having had plenty of drink and are not able to control themselves. They pay whatever it costs to go into the clubs. We then have the further problem of drug pushers, many of whom buy one another off to have free access to particular clubs to try to get as many young people as possible to take drugs.  At first they nearly give the drugs for nothing to get young people hooked so that they are potential future customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any society must have rules, regulations and laws.  Bouncers, door men and security people &mdash;&mdash; whatever they want to be called &mdash; must be subject to regulations so that owners cannot pick people off the street to stand at the door of a dancehall or club.  Some people are not suitable for the job, although they think they are.  They want to have fights and to beat people up but they should be locked up themselves.  Those types <Col N="1340" /> of people apply for the jobs.  Not all bouncers are like that; there are decent, honourable people who need to subsidise their income to raise their families and who do this on a part-time basis. They are forced into this work because their jobs do not pay as well as they should.  However, when some thugs put on a uniform and start chewing gum, they see an easy mark in the queue and if he steps even slightly out of line they take him into the toilet and deal with him.  The poor person is often so drunk he does not know what is happening to him until he ends up in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to ensure this is regulated and he now has an opportunity to do so. Deputy Farrelly has brought a good Bill before the Dáil, the Minister should take it on board and if it has to be changed this side of the House will be delighted to support him.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to say why he has targeted rural western pubs in his zero tolerance campaign.  This issue will not go away and I hope Deputy Higgins and other western Deputies will take up this issue along with me, because what is happening is wrong.  My area caters for thousands of tourists &mdash; I know the Minister would like them all to go to Kerry and we do not mind him getting his share.  We want to be able to entertain tourists, we do not want them going to pubs at 11 p.m. and being put out at midnight.  I do not say the law should be broken but I cannot see why a tradition built up over the past 40 years is being changed now.  If the clubs and discos had been targeted I would compliment the Minister but that is not happening.</P>
    <P>This is what is wrong with law and order at present &mdash; those who break the law in a small way are targeted.  The people we want targeted are those who steal property or hurt people.  Zero tolerance in this area will not work, I know this from talking to people &mdash; I am restraining myself from saying something I may regret for which I may pay the penalty tomorrow.  It is easy to stop a car driving at 70 miles per hour but it is not so easy to catch someone who beats up or kills someone or the person who robbed my car or my house. These are the people we want targeted, not people who exceed the speed limit by a mile or two, although I do not condone that.  It is easy to get revenue that way.</P>
    <P>Why were the five western counties targeted in the zero tolerance scheme?  The Minister should ask the superintendent, chief superintendent or assistant commissioner responsible for putting this measure in place to target either the whole country or no one.  I do not say people should break the law but we should examine the licensing laws and the law should apply to everyone, without simply attacking rural people again.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on bringing this before the Dáil.</P>

Many of the bouncers I know, especially in my constituency, do an excellent job and must be commended for the effective manner in which they do their work.  However, as a young person who frequents night clubs and late night pubs and from talking to other young people, I am only too well aware of the inadequacies of the present system.  There are many hair-raising stories of young people being treated as human punch bags, being assaulted or subjected to excessive force by a bouncer on an ego trip, an individual who can slip into the night and never be held responsible for his actions.  This is due to the lack of accountability and informal working arrangements with their employers.  The Bill will help to rectify this problem, as my colleagues explained earlier.</P>
      <P>Another scenario which happens in many areas, especially the cities, is a kind of apartheid whereby people are discriminated against on grounds of age or clothing.  A bouncer believes he has the God-given right to refuse entry to an ordinary law abiding citizen for no reason other than dislike of the prospective customer's socks. Young people must run the gauntlet of the men in black after queuing for 15 to 20 minutes &mdash; the queue is designed to give passers-by the impression that this is a trendy place.  This is a regular occurrence on Friday and Saturday nights, especially in Temple Bar and other parts of Dublin city centre.  On reaching the door, people often hear bouncers say they do not recognise faces.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem &mdash; an isolated one, but a problem nonetheless &mdash; of bouncers dealing in drugs.  As Deputy Farrelly said, many bouncers allow dealers into night clubs.  Water is often turned off in clubs and young people are forced to buy it at the counter.  Ecstasy tablets are being passed around like smarties in some locations. The Garda know about these places but it is hard to clamp down on them and the bouncers can be held responsible for this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under age drinking is as serious as the drug problem and it is bouncers who let young people into night clubs.  It is true that young people under 18 do not have facilities but bouncers should not allow them into night clubs where drink is freely available.  They are not supposed to be in any place with a bar extension.  Young people have enough problems without having to cope with a bouncer dealing drugs.  His duty is to maintain law and order, to protect the customer and to keep discos free of trouble makers.  Young <Col N="1342" /> people need the protection of this Bill to avoid such abuses of power.</P>
    <P>This legislation will also be of benefit to the publican who has in the past faced a guessing game in recruiting door men &mdash; he often does not know what type of person he is employing, especially in built up areas, because there is no register.  The Bill should be applied to other sectors in the security industry, especially at sporting and concert events.  Many bouncers think they are God Almighty and can decide whether young people can get into a club or will have their faces beaten in.  There have been numerous cases of young people being thrown on the street for the ambulance to pick them up.</P>
    <P>This whole area needs to be regulated and we should introduce some form of training scheme. A new training course for doormen who work in licensed premises was set up recently in Scotland where members of the police force, the fire brigade service and other professionals are brought together for training.</P>
    <P>An incident occurred recently outside a fast food outlet in which an individual was robbed and beaten about the face.  A bouncer standing in a nearby doorway did not even think to contact the Garda.  The bouncer was not involved in the incident but there was an onus on him to ensure there was law and order even if the incident did not occur on the premises he was protecting.  That young person spent two weeks in hospital and was on a life support machine for a number of days as a result of the beating he received on that occasion.  I ask the Minister to accept the Bill which is important to young people in that it regulates this area.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on his work in producing this Bill.  As I acknowledged recently in the House on a similar occasion, I am aware of the work and effort involved in producing a Bill such as this and the lack of backup facilities available to Opposition Deputies.  It is right to acknowledge Deputy Farrelly's achievements in that respect.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge that Deputy Farrelly has had a long and keen interest in the proper regulation of the security industry.  Indeed, the Deputy made a submission to the Consultative Group on the Security Industry which was established in the middle of last year.  The submission was given due acknowledgement in the report of that group published recently and which obviously was given appropriate consideration by the consultative group in the formulation of its conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no secret that I and other Members on all sides have long favoured the proper regulation of the security industry.  In that regard I welcome the spirit behind the Deputy's Bill and I understand the philosophy which underpins it. However, for reasons which I will put before the House in my contribution, the Government has decided not to accept the Bill.  A careful examination <Col N="1343" /> of the Bill, and related issues of a significant nature, has led the Government to that conclusion, and I propose to outline the reasons in some detail.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in the Deputy's Bill, particularly with regard to access to employment, raise significant constitutional issues affecting the fundamental rights of individuals and the obligation which falls on the State to treat all citizens as equal before the law.  In addition, the provisions of the Bill are somewhat restrictive in nature in that they do not address the wider issues which need to be addressed in any proposals aimed at regulating or raising standards in an industry such as recruitment and training requirements, monitoring working and employment standards, implementing international developments, inspections and all the general requirements which go towards ensuring a professional industry which is accountable for its performance.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the spirit of what is proposed by the Deputy which are welcome. However, the Bill is concerned solely with provisions for the registration, control and supervision of persons engaged as door supervisors, or &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo; as they are more colloquially known, acting on or in the vicinity of a licensed premises, defined in the Bill as any place for which a licence has been granted under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, or the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1995. The Bill confines itself to this narrow aspect of the broad security industry which a recent estimate put on the scale of involving nearly 400 companies, employing over 10,000 employees and with a turnover estimated at about £200 million annually.</P>
    <P>The survey to which I refer &mdash; carried out by FÁS in 1994 but also taking into account the strong growth in the sector since then &mdash; does not even include the door supervisor or &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo; sector which is largely believed to be part-time in nature and conducted mainly in the black economy.  Having regard to the significant scale of the broad security industry, and the genuine desire and recognition on all sides of the House of a general need for consistent standards in the industry, adequate selection and training of staff and overall compliance with Revenue, Social Welfare and Company Law, the best way forward is to address all the relevant issues through a combination of considered measures related to the broad spectrum of the industry rather than by a narrow or piecemeal approach to particular aspects of the industry as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill also makes certain provisions for the establishment of a door supervisors' register in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with local Garda district officers being responsible for issuing or refusing certificates of fitness on a number of stated grounds.  Whatever about the Department <Col N="1344" /> having direct responsibility for the establishment of such a register &mdash; and I have serious doubts in that regard &mdash; there is no doubt that these provisions touch on a most sensitive and important part of any proposals to regulate any sector of the private security industry.</P>
      <P>For that reason, it is clear that any proposals in this area would require careful consideration to ensure a consistency and a fairness in their operation which is not only universally accepted but is also in line with the constitutional requirements of natural justice.  While I agree it can be argued convincingly that a criminal conviction would appear to be a good reason to prevent a person from gaining access to the industry, I wonder whether any offence against the person is valid in this regard.  While it could be argued that any criminal conviction should debar access, it could also be argued that only robbery or dishonesty type offences should be taken into account, if previous convictions are to be taken into account at all.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in the Bill relating to an applicant who is, by reason of his or her general character or known habits, not a fit or proper person to be given a certificate of personal fitness. This is a rather vague and non-specific provision which, under the terms of the Bill, would be required to be implemented with consistency by individual superintendents of the Garda Síochána to whom applications are to be made.  Apart from the difficulty in defining general guidelines for the force to interpret such a provision, it is difficult to see how a matter of subjective opinion such as this could be applied by individual Garda officers in a uniformly fair and consistent manner.</P>
      <P>Access to confidential information held by the Garda Síochána, for example, would appear to be essential to any system of vetting.  The public is rightly concerned that any information held about them is treated in the utmost confidence. Access to such information is always governed by the general principle that no information is given to anyone, irrespective of their status, unless there are extremely serious public interest issues which would warrant departure from that principle.</P>
      <P>Apart from disclosures of information which are governed by existing statutory provisions, it is not the practice generally to disclose information on convictions, for example, to employers.  If it is proposed that information on convictions for certain types of employment be made available, the supply of that information by the Garda Síochána could give rise to serious legal and constitutional issues over the right to disclose information, its accuracy and the fairness or natural justice of it being disclosed.</P>
      <P>It could also be argued that no distinction in that regard should be drawn between those employed in the security industry and those employed, for example, in the banking sector or on other similar duties which involve positions of trust or in the handling of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to these important provisions of the proposed <Col N="1345" /> Bill, not to dismiss them entirely but to underline that the concept of &ldquo;fitness to practise&rdquo; within the security industry, if it is to be implemented in a proper and consistent manner, requires careful consideration as to its effect and the way in which such a concept is to be operated. Any such approach could involve the introduction of new concepts in Irish law which raise issues of constitutional rights and natural justice. It is important, therefore, that any such concepts be addressed in the context of general access to the broad security industry, and not simply in the context of access to one narrow aspect of that industry &mdash; that is, the employment of door supervisors, or &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo;, acting on or in the vicinity of licensed premises.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the private security industry is under no special legal obligations and possesses no special legal privileges.  That is to say, it is under no special legal obligations which do not apply to other employers, for example.  Security personnel also have no special legal powers or, in particular, special powers to carry or use weapons which are unique to their jobs.  Offences in this area, as Deputy Farrelly pointed out, apply to them in the same way as they apply to everyone else and there are no exemptions in law to allow security personnel to behave in a certain way simply because they are members of the private security industry.</P>
    <P>Security personnel have no particular powers, either, to stop or arrest anybody other than those particular powers which apply to all individuals. Persons entering premises cannot be forced either to be searched or to open bags, for example, to satisfy door supervisors.  I make these points because it is often assumed that security personnel using specially protected vehicles to carry large amounts of cash, or wearing uniforms, as Deputy Ring pointed out, or behaving in an aggressive manner at the doorways to public premises, are somehow representative of &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; and performing functions which are akin, for example, to those performed by members of the Garda Síochána.  It is important for the public to clearly understand such personnel have no special powers.  Any person pretending to have such special powers is clearly deceiving the public.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, these very points which have long prompted questions about the control of the industry and, indeed, my own concern that, no matter how complex the issue, the question of some sort of control or regulation must be addressed in a comprehensive and considered manner soon.  In that regard, I am in full agreement with Deputies Farrelly, Ring and Naughten.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my contribution, I referred to the consultative group on the private security industry which was established last May to review activities in the industry and to provide a forum for discussion on the regulation of the industry. The establishment of the group stemmed from a review of the security industry which had been completed by the then Department of Justice at <Col N="1346" /> that time.  This involved an analysis of issues such as regulation, the examination of ways in which such a broad spectrum of activity currently carried out by the industry could be regulated in practice, and consideration of regulatory practice for the security industry in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The consultative group was asked to take the work already done by the Department's review of this complex issue a step further by considering options for increased self-regulation, the possible licensing of companies and the case for statutory regulation of the industry.  The group was also asked, in focusing on options for regulation, to include the costs and benefits to the consumer of further regulation, and to consider the prospects for improving standards within the industry.</P>
    <P>In addressing these specific issues, the group acknowledged the industry covers a diverse range of occupational activities.  The group attempted to identify these occupations and to categorise them.  In a group described as being of primary concern were categorised occupations reflecting the broad spectrum of the industry such as security operatives; door supervisors or &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo;; in-house security personnel; security consultants, including advisers, salespersons and investigators; and installers of security equipment.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that certain procedures should be introduced for all licence applications, including those in the category of company and company director, as well as those occupational activities which I mentioned earlier. The group recognised that complex problems needed to be addressed in any proposed licensing system and that no single solution will prevent, alleviate or solve all the problems within the private security industry.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the report of the consultative group, which was chaired by Mr. Donal Hanley, financial consultant, was published at the end of January.  I am very grateful to the chairman and all the members of the group, which comprised representatives of the industry, IBEC, SIPTU, the Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and individual members representing the public interest, who gave generously of their time to consider this complex issue.</P>
    <P>An important point emphasised in the report of the consultative group is that any regulatory framework for the security industry will not only have to deal with the question of access to the industry, but also with a whole series of issues aimed at having a significant impact on the industry in the medium and long-term.  These issues are not addressed in Deputy Farrelly's Bill but were considered essential by the consultative group in professionalising the industry and in improving standards in employment and training generally.</P>
    <P>If I illustrate these issues, it will give the House a clear idea why the whole question of regulating the security industry needs to be tackled in an integrated, comprehensive manner rather than in a singular and piecemeal way, as is envisaged by <Col N="1347" /> this Bill.  Among the functions identified by the consultative group as requiring consideration in the development of any regulatory framework are advising the Minister on matters relating to the industry; issuing licences to companies, directors and individuals and maintenance of a publicly accessible register of these licence holders; specifying minimum standards for certain sectors; laying down training requirements for licence holders; designating approved training courses and institutions; carrying out research into any aspect of the industry; maintaining records for research, planning and manpower; holding fitness to practice hearings and appeals; implementing relevant EU directives or regulations; monitoring international developments in relation to the industry; publishing an annual report on the industry; conducting on site inspections and dealing with complaints.</P>
    <P>Any comprehensive approach, it is suggested, cannot be confined, therefore, to simply regulating access to the industry or, as in this Bill, to one particular sector of it.  I am on record on a number of occasions as favouring the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; regulation of the private security industry.  I am still of that view, but I would lay the emphasis, without taking in any way from Deputy Farrelly's Bill, on the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, which I envisage as requiring a comprehensive and integrated approach to this complex problem.</P>
    <P>The report of the consultative group is a significant step in advancing this desirable public policy objective.  I am giving the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report detailed consideration.  I acknowledge that if effect is to be given to its central recommendations complex legislation, introducing new concepts, will be required.  I intend in the immediate future to consult with my colleagues in Government who will have an interest in the recommendations of the consultative group which impinge on their areas of responsibility.  When I have completed that consultation I intend to bring proposals to Government which will recommend an appropriate course of action.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on me to ensure that there is no other vehicle which could advance the regulatory issue.  I must be sure that the potential for all other possible approaches to regulation has been fully explored before committing taxpayers' money to the setting up, for example, of a new State agency.  While I may see the logic in it, I must persuade my Cabinet colleagues, especially the Minister for Finance, that the consultative group report is the only way forward.  There must also be an efficient and cost effective way of enforcing any regulatory system and these implications must be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the Government should only regulate where there is a clear need to do so and where the public interest will be served by such regulation.  It is, of course, in the public interest that the security industry generally operates to <Col N="1348" /> the highest possible standards and, if international examples are to be followed, I expect we will see an increasing range of functions being carried out by the industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We will also see further expansion in the scope for public and private co-operation in crime prevention strategies.  For example, a number of developments are taking place which will have a significant impact on the industry in the medium and long term.  These include developments at EU level of certain standards in relation to work, working time, training, health and safety and so on.  These developments will also have to be taken on board and the implications of regulatory standards in particular will have to be assessed in so far as they impinge on the private security industry.</P>
    <P>For all of the reasons I have outlined I regret that the Government has decided not to accept the Bill at present.  I appreciate and acknowledge Deputy Farrelly's concern in this area, which I have shared for a long time.  There is no doubt that the public also shares it.  Given the recent growth of the industry, and having regard to the fact that it is becoming more visible in everyday business and lives, that concern is understandable.  It is not surprising that there should be demands for some kind of control over an industry which is involved in so many sensitive areas and which, because of the nature of its work, is considered by many to carry out law and order functions.  However, this complex area can only be addressed by a comprehensive approach to the variety of issues which I have touched upon and which are not addressed in the narrow scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some of the points made tonight and which doubtless will continue to be made during the course of the debate have been made before. There is nothing new in most of them.  Indeed, I have made some of them in the past.  It is important they be addressed now.  They will be addressed in the continuing examination of the report of the consultative group and in the light of the findings of the crime forum, which finishes its Dublin sessions this week.  When that examination is completed I will immediately bring proposals to Government recommending what I consider to be the most realistic, effective and appropriate course of action to cater for a growing industry in a holistic and integrated manner which will take account of future developments and which will also take account of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I understood and appreciated the philosophy which underpinned the proposed legislation and I indicated that it was a matter of regret that I could not accept it. I have also outlined why it will be necessary to address the question of the regulation of the private security industry in a comprehensive and integrated manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to a matter which is extraneous to the legislation but which is close to his heart.  I have always been of the view, rightly <Col N="1349" /> or wrongly, that people sometimes engage in mischief when their faculties are not fully stretched elsewhere.  It is a practice in which I perhaps engaged in the past.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome the Minister's proposed initiative on the intoxicating liquor laws.  Only today I tried to contribute to that debate, and I am very glad the Minister is preparing the ground with a view to making some changes.  I hope in the near future he will have the opportunity of responding in this House to the Labour Party's proposals in this matter.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Farrelly on his work in preparing this Bill.  Preparing a Bill requires quite a lot of work.  Those who go to the trouble to research a Bill to the extent that Deputy Farrelly has deserve congratulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the spirit of the Minister's speech to the extent that he acknowledges the need for legislation.  I would have preferred had he accepted Deputy Farrelly's Bill, but we have to <Col N="1350" /> live with the way things are.  It is good that the Minister is at least facing up to the need for change in this area.  That is very much what the public also feel.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address an issue that is relevant to the lives of many people, especially the young.  Those who use places of public entertainment on a regular basis frequently encounter bouncers, or door supervisors as the Bill calls them.  These people provide an important service, and the work they do is difficult and hazardous. From time to time they have to deal with people who have consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and who may be agitated as a result of factors that have nothing to do with the club or public house they are seeking to enter.</P>
    <P>I am sure nobody would argue that the service provided by door supervisors is not necessary. Indeed, many public houses and clubs could not function if some people were not excluded from the premises.  There is an adage in the pub trade that if certain people were not barred the place could not function.  In some areas the capacity of the management of the public house is indicated by the number of people who are excluded, some very properly but some, unfortunately, wrongly.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now in a minority of EU countries which has not legislated to control and regulate the standards of the service provided by door supervisors.  All EU countries, with the exception of Greece and the UK, currently have regulations.  It seems there is now an unanswerable case for Ireland adopting a similar approach to that of the majority of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for introducing regulations.  This relates to the reality that the service provided by door supervisors is likely to be a growing one.  Those who work as door supervisors number less than the Garda Síochána.  On the figures given by Deputy Farrelly, they number rather more than the Garda Síochána, and I am sure Deputy Farrelly has good grounds for his estimate, but I am working off a different set of figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking only about legal operators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the legal ones.</P>
      <P>It is the figure in the report which has informed my view.  One way or the other, if Ireland follows the trend seen in other countries, those involved in this aspect of the security industry will significantly outnumber the Garda Síochána in a few years.  For example, in the US, people involved in law enforcement are outnumbered by a ratio of about three to one by those engaged in the security industry.  While at this point it is not possible to estimate with accuracy the total number of people engaged in the provision of the service of door supervisor, one estimate indicates as many as 10,000, with as many as 2,500 to 3,500 in Dublin, if one accepts the upper range of the estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because there are a number of aspects of the industry which now need to <Col N="1351" /> be addressed urgently.  It is essential at this stage that standards are set for the industry.  The industry is now of a size that the welfare of the public demands that it is no longer allowed to regulate itself in the manner which has evolved over the years.  The industry is one which has grown considerably and, to some extent, in a haphazard manner over the years.  It is estimated that there are about 400 companies which provide security services and that the industry has a turnover of the order of £200 million.  By any standards this is big business.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about the manner in which some parts of the industry does business. The industry is characterised by low wages, in some cases by low standards, by a big turnover of staff and by long working hours.  Having said that, I acknowledge that there are many excellent firms who provide security services.  Some of these are international companies which adhere to the highest standards.  Many of the Irish companies are also excellent.  However, there are some companies whose behaviour gives rise to a good deal of concern.  There is evidence that some companies work to low standards.  With some companies there have been difficulties arising from their failure to meet their obligations to the Revenue Commissioners and their obligations under social welfare legislation.  There can be little doubt that many companies who provide a security service do so in the black economy, and that is something which we should try to eliminate.</P>
    <P>Another major cause of concern is the considerable body of evidence suggesting that criminal elements have become involved in the industry.  Some of these elements have operated in a very aggressive and heavy-handed manner which is totally unacceptable in a civilised society.  Some of the people engaged in the provision of security services as bouncers are totally unsuitable for the type of work involved.  There is an element among door supervisors who are, of their nature, aggressive and obnoxious, and who seek to aggravate at every opportunity.  Such people are in many ways a provocation to that small element of the public who themselves are prone to aggressive behaviour.  It is very important and desirable that such people should not be engaged in the industry.  Their engagement in the industry can only lead to trouble.  It is essential to emphasise that in a well regulated industry the avoidance of trouble at doors of clubs and public houses should be a priority.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about the manner in which some companies have adhered to the provisions of company law.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that some element of training for the personnel who provide the service is essential. Those who work in this service need, as a matter of urgency, to be trained in psychology and best practice in handling the public in difficult situations.  There is no doubt that people in this industry on a nightly basis for one reason or another, <Col N="1352" /> have to refuse entry to places of entertainment. People can be refused entry to clubs and public houses with tact and in a manner that does not give rise to confrontation, or they can be refused in an aggressive, hostile confrontational manner. Those who are experienced and trained know how to handle these situations effectively and in a way that minimises aggression and violence. There have been many cases of violence at the doors of places of entertainment which could have been avoided if a little more tact had been used by the door supervisors.  Some speakers from Fine Gael placed considerable emphasis on this type of behaviour.  There is no doubt that they are correct.  The people who become the victims of this behaviour are, to a large degree, young people on low incomes, who find themselves at the mercy of these obnoxious creatures who, when they find themselves in a uniform, become aggressive and hostile.  Such persons have no place in the industry.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons door supervisors should be trained.  In the event of emergencies it is essential that door supervisors should have effective training and know how to supervise the safe evacuation of premises.  It is also important that they be able to recognise and prevent fire and other hazards.  In difficult circumstances, a properly trained staff can make all the difference by preventing serious accidents and ensuring that events are run safely.</P>
    <P>In the case of large events such as concerts, it is especially important that those who man doors are very well trained.  There have in the past been serious accidents which could undoubtedly have been prevented if the workforce had been better trained.  It is important that the service provided by bouncers or door supervisors is viewed as vital. It is in the public interest that those who provide the service are well trained.  Good training provides an element of protection for the public, which is most important.  A workforce of trained door supervisors will cost more, but it is worth it in terms of making life pleasant for people, preventing accidents and, in some cases, dreadful tragedies.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill tabled by Deputy Farrelly are in broad accord with the contents of a report commissioned by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and published by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in January this year.  The report is good.  It is relatively brief but it deals with the issues in a succinct manner.  It provides a good analysis of the position in the industry in the context of the grossly inadequate information available about it.  The membership of the review group is broadly representative of the industry and its recommendations are sensible.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish a licensing authority is relevant.  I accept some of the concerns expressed by the Minister.  However, I presume he expressed them on behalf of the Minister for Finance given the nature of the Department of Finance when any new type of authority is proposed. <Col N="1353" />  Such suggestions give rise to a reflexive refusal which leads to a long series of persuasive moves.  However, the proposals are good.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the Garda is involved in a vetting process, as suggested in the report. This would provide an important element of protection in terms of excluding people who are unsuitable for the type of work carried out by bouncers.  More importantly, it would curb criminal elements who engage in this type of work for reasons and agendas which are in many cases different from what they appear.  Many ancillary types of criminal behaviour are involved and the remarks made by other speakers about drugs are most relevant in this regard.  There is a tendency among certain criminal elements to diversify when the forces of law and order curb them and diminish their capacity to make progress in certain areas.  An element engaged in this industry plays a role in facilitating that type of undesirable diversification.</P>
    <P>It is most important that &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; are precluded from involvement in this industry.  The licensing body should take special care to ensure that such people are excluded.  There is already sufficient opportunity for what may be called the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; element of society to make itself a menace to the public without allowing it to be involved in this industry where it would have an excellent level of opportunity.  Such people are already a nuisance and there is no point facilitating them by allowing them to engage the small number of people who have usually consumed excessive alcohol and are seeking aggravation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an appeal system where people feel they have been treated unfairly when their applications are rejected.  It is important this provision is included in the proposals.  The idea of an appeals system is good even if it would cost more and make matters more cumbersome.</P>
    <P>The review report includes a discussion of the categories of individuals who should be excluded from this type of work because of their records in relation to illegal activities in which they engaged in the past.  The report is discursive on this topic and presents a series of options regarding the manner in which this aspect could be handled.  A series of categories of offences are mentioned which would automatically lead to the exclusion of applicants.  There is also another series of categories of offences which, of necessity, would not lead to the exclusion of applicants.</P>
    <P>It is important the Garda is given an element of discretion in this area.  Undoubtedly, a certain type of individual should be excluded.  People who have been convicted of certain offences should also of necessity be excluded.  However, there is another element of society who may have engaged in illegal activity in the past but who have mended their ways.  It is important such people are given the opportunity to return to the normal workforce and earn a decent living on the basis that they have mended their ways and the risk of them becoming involved in illegal activity once more is insignificant.  Ultimately, this matter <Col N="1354" /> should be decided by the licensing authority on the advice of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Bill is relevant to the lives of many people, particularly young people who must face these individuals at weekends.  I often wonder why people are so anxious to enter places whose doors are manned by unpleasant individuals.  I presume it is because an illusion is created that something important or interesting is taking place because entry is restricted. I am sure people are greatly disappointed once they are allowed into such places.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses an important and relevant topic.  Although I am disappointed the Minister did not accept the Bill, I am pleased at his attitude.  We are all facing in the same direction in terms of introducing legislation to control this important service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Bill before Christmas when it was published and I saw merit in it.  I had the opportunity to travel to Glasgow in February to consider the licensing laws and measures for the control of alcohol in public areas there.  I spoke to the Glasgow licensing authority and a superintendent attached to Strathclyde police force.  A number of measures have been introduced in Glasgow in relation to the control of drinking in public places and on streets.  An important point is that the Glasgow licensing authority does not grant licences to pub owners or nightclub operators unless they have door supervisors or bouncers who have undergone a training course.  I was most interested in that aspect and I intended to bring it to the attention of the Minister.  The Minister outlined why the Bill cannot be accepted in terms of its possible effects on constitutional provisions.  However, I ask him to consider the feasibility of introducing regulations under which publicans and their employees must undergo a training programme.</P>
      <P>I am no longer a person for late nights, but I am sure Deputy Farrelly accepts there is tremendous movement of young people after the pubs close at night in major urban centres, particularly Cork.  Many people are on the streets, going to nightclubs.  The danger of so many people converging on so few nightspots at the same time is that there could be much conflict.  Therefore, it is important that the door supervisors or bouncers are well trained and able to take care of people who may be unable to take care of themselves. The extent of movement of people at that time of night causes tremendous problems for the Garda.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Social Welfare Bill, 1998: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>In page 9, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.  &mdash;The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, lay before <Col N="1355" /> Dáil Éireann, a detailed report on the implications of the extension of the Family Income Supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. O'Keeffe).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the question of extending the family income supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.  As I stated earlier, one of the few bouquets I would toss at the Minister in respect of the Bill is that he agreed to make family income supplement payable on the basis of net income. However, in doing so he discriminated against the self-employed who are not entitled to family income supplement.  I am not speaking about the Michael Smurfits or the Tony O'Reillys of this world.  I am talking about small farmers or shopkeepers or those involved in the service industry in a small way who are merely surviving.  If those people have a family they are as much entitled to a family income supplement as a PAYE worker.</P>
      <P>While the corner shop may be threatened by large supermarkets, the new concept of work will involve more self-employment.  As well as encouraging people to take up PAYE work, State policy should also encourage people to take up self-employment which is the route to work for many people.  The world has changed and the nature of work has also changed.  The PAYE job was the solution of the 1960s, but the way to confront unemployment in the new millennium will be different.  There are already more possibilities open to people involved in self-employment.  If we are to encourage people to take up self-employment surely they should qualify for family income supplement.</P>
      <P>If the self-employed are unable to provide for their families they will give up work and go on the dole.  From a social point of view, it would be wise to include the self-employed in the scheme and there would also be a return to the State in that it would retain people in self-employment or encourage others to take it up.  A person with eight children who is on the dole would need to get fairly remunerative self-employment to make it attractive for him to go off the dole, but the family income supplement would encourage such people to do so.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister, having gone half way and introduced this discriminatory measure, to go the full way as soon as possible.  I do not expect him to table an amendment immediately.  However, if the merits of the case are agreed on all fronts and we accept it is the right way forward I hope it will be introduced as soon as possible, whether by the Minister's Government or by a Fine Gael Government.  In case this Minister is around for the next budget and social welfare Bill, I am putting forward this proposal now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe. Family income supplement should be available to the self-employed.  It is unsustainable that a <Col N="1356" /> Government Department should discriminate against the self-employed by excluding them from benefits.  The Revenue Commissioners will accept statements of accounts from the self-employed as being their actual income, but its sister Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will not accept those figures.  It will not pay them family income supplement because it believes they are fiddling the system.  By denying the self-employed the family income supplement, the Department is telling those people it does not trust them.</P>
      <P>It was stated earlier that support for families with children is vital.  Family income supplement revolves around children.  The payment is based on one's income and the number of children in the family and is targeted at families on low income.  The scheme has been very successful.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows people in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency who have stayed at work because of the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, there are a number of anomalies in the system.  A few days ago I met a person who told me her husband takes home approximately £105 per week and receives unemployment assistance for the days he does not work.  Their total income is £220 per week, which includes the family income supplement.  They have three children, one of whom has a disability and needs constant care, but they do not qualify for a domiciliary care allowance because he attends a school for the deaf from Monday to Friday.  They are repaying £120 per week on a structured payments system to clear debts they owe. She went back to work two days a week and receives £40, but as a result the family income supplement was cut by £40.  Therefore, there has been no net increase in the family budget.  I could not tell her how to improve the family's position, but I am sure the Minister's officials could devise a system to help families who are willing to work and anxious to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>We must address the anomaly whereby for every additional £1 one earns, the family income supplement is cut by £1.  If one gets a £10 increase, 40 per cent automatically goes on tax, the £6 family income supplement is forfeited, PRSI has be paid with the result that there is a net loss at certain income levels.  I am straying from the amendment which deals with paying FIS to the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lengthy debate on FIS and the self-employed on Committee Stage.  Some members of the Minister's party, one of whom is a Minister of State, strongly supported the idea that FIS should be paid to the self-employed.  It would be interesting to hear her stance on this occasion. While I realise this is expensive it will have to be provided for in the context of equality in the longer term, as mentioned by Deputy De Rossa. If an equality case was brought forward from the point of view of the self-employed, the courts would find it unsustainable.  Will the Minister <Col N="1357" /> examine this issue carefully as it will become a major issue in the next number of years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  While all amendments, if accepted, would cost a great deal of money that does not take from the fact that we have to make a point. Deputy O'Keeffe talked about small farmers.  I understand intimately what he was talking about since the majority of farmers in my constituency are in the same boat.  I represent a constituency that depends a great deal on tourism, which is seasonal.  Share fishermen who are seasonal workers are entitled to some social welfare.  There are a number of small shopkeepers and cafe-restaurant owners in Sneem, Waterville and so on who open their doors from Easter to September. The people we are speaking about are willing to work.  We are not talking about allocating a social welfare payment to people who are not willing to work.</P>
      <P>At our local authority meeting yesterday we had a discussion about rural Ireland.  I live in a town where it is impossible for young people to buy a house.  We are anxious that our people will live in small rural communities to keep them alive and ensure they are not burdened with huge mortgages.  Will the Minister take these views into account and examine the existing anomalies regarding family income supplement for the self-employed?  There is a myth that when we talk about the self-employed we are talking about big business people.  These people who cannot afford accountants are honest and willing to keep their books in order.  The local social welfare officer will be well aware of their business.  These people are better off having their own business and giving some work to their children which keeps them off the streets.  While I commend the Minister for improvements in the family income supplement, we have to go further.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin reminded me of the envy I always have of representatives from Kerry South. I come from a constituency in the North-east where we would be pleased to have even half the tourist industry of Kerry South.  It is a source of great business to the constituency which does not go to many other constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his acknowledgement of the move in the budget in relation to FIS on a net income basis.  One of the main reasons for this was that it was the key commitment in Partnership 2000.  While I acknowledge that FIS and the self-employed have been to the fore, particularly with the farming community, there was not a similar commitment in Partnership 2000.  The issue that addressed the social partners in this respect was FIS on net income basis.  On Committee Stage I was asked to re-examine the estimate of costs because Deputy O'Keeffe made some strong arguments in relation to take-up and those at whom this would be targeted.  I have <Col N="1358" /> asked the Department to examine the whole issue.  The figure I produced of £30 million per annum was based on a 100 per cent take-up which would be in addition to the existing expenditure involved in providing UA to self-employed persons, whose income falls below the rate of UA appropriate to the family circumstances.  The cost implications and the actual estimate are being examined.  I have asked my Department to examine the issue in the wider context of the range of income supports available to self-employed persons and small farmers, to determine whether the extension of FIS is a more appropriate route to meet the needs of those concerned.  In the case of small farmers it is necessary to take into account the range of other supports provided to them by the Department of Agriculture and Food, which are not inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>Following examination of that issue I will come back to FIS in the context of the unemployed in a budgetary context.  While we have had some discussion of the whole issue on Committee and Report Stages I can look at a number of areas but ultimately I have to prioritise the finance available and obviously something will have to give.  A number of issues are to the fore and these will also have to be looked at</P>
    <P>In relation to the case instanced by Deputy McGrath, will he please produce the details?  Family income supplement is paid for a 52 week period and is not affected by changes in family circumstances in that period but it may be affected when it is reassessed at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up the time of the House by repeating what has been said by Deputies.  The figures produced by the Minister were based on a 100 per cent take-up of FIS. When that is combined with the fact that people who are currently on family income supplement will probably move on to better and higher paid employment and will no longer need it, there might be room for flexibility.  The low take up of a supplement that is so badly needed must be a matter of concern to the Minister.  People must be in great need just to qualify for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to small farmers who are in receipt of unemployment assistance or income support if they are on low wages.  It has been brought to my attention that some farmers who traditionally received the &ldquo;farmers' dole&rdquo; are now encountering difficulty in receiving such assistance.  As they are not permanently available for work they are being removed from the scheme.  This matter must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Technically, such farmers are not available for work in so far as they must do a certain amount of farm work every day.  However, their income is very low and, in the absence of unemployment assistance, where else will they receive supplementary income to give them a sustainable wage?  Perhaps the Minister would ask his officials to examine this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A good case has been made for the approach I advocate.  If the Minister had his way and enough money, he probably would be glad to agree to it because there is discrimination in this area.  I accept it was not included in Partnership 2000 but it is the next stage in the completion of the family income supplement process.  The cost will not be the figure quoted because in the PAYE sector the take up has been low.  It used to be about a third and I doubt that it has reached a half yet.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy McGrath, I have been concerned for a long time about the odd way in which the small farmers' assistance is paid.  How can a farmer be expected to run a farm and still be available for work?  My colleague, Deputy Creed, has raised this matter on a number of occasions.  It has been raised a number of times in his constituency as some of his constituents have been refused assistance. This amendment might be the way forward.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not simply refer to the traditional self-employed.  Under no circumstances does it apply to the well off self-employed because there is an income limit.  It applies to the new approach to work which will involve more and more people becoming self-employed.  From that point of view, it should be economic as well as social policy to proceed with the scheme.  I will not push the amendment to a vote but I hope we can return to the issue at another time.</P>

      <P>One speaker spoke about getting the unemployed back to work and into self-employment.  The most successful scheme has been the back-to-work allowance scheme under which a substantial number of people have come off the dole and are now self-employed.  It is a very successful scheme.</P>

      <P>There have been suggestions that the take up of family income supplement has been historically low.  That might well be the case but it would be a source of concern if such a scheme, which is designed for people on low income, were available and was not being availed of.  On a money basis, the take up is approximately 60 per cent and on the basis of numbers the take up is 40 per cent.  That is quite low.</P>

      <P>On a numbers basis, 40 per cent of those who are estimated to be entitled to the supplement take it up.  It is probably the best measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed for some time about smallholders' dole.  The concern is not so much about the way in which people are informed they are not available for work but because of means assessments of capital which <Col N="1360" /> are occurring as a result of recent changes. However, that is the nature of being involved with the Department and with a scheme such as smallholders' dole.  People must account for their other income.  Personnel in my Department are doing their duty by ensuring that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely and properly and that it is going to the right people.  I doubt that people are being unfairly treated.  What is happening in that scheme is the same as what has happened in a number of other schemes run by the Department.  People are being subjected to a reassessment of means.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  -Not later than 6 months from the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to amend and extend the Social Welfare Free Schemes as they apply to widows and widowers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to have been a member of the Government which introduced the widower's pension.  Earlier in this debate, I spoke about injustices to women.  The absence of a widower's pension was a great injustice to men.</P>
      <P>Widowed people suffer huge financial loss on the death of their spouses.  More often than not, they are left to rear a family alone and are not prepared for the consequences of what is usually the sudden death of a spouse.  If they have young children, they might be obliged to give up their jobs.  Everybody knows of widowed people who had to give up full-time jobs to look after a number of children following the death of their spouse.</P>
      <P>The allocation of free schemes, such as the free travel pass, free electricity allowance and free telephone rental, to such families would make a huge difference to their lives.  Even if the Minister allocated the schemes until their families were reared, it would be of great benefit.  Widows who might never have worked outside the home and whose husbands were the breadwinners are at a serious loss.  Often they have a small, non-contributory pension on which to run a household and rear children.  They not only suffer the loss of their spouse but also a halving of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not seek the immediate introduction of such a measure.  However, I hope the Minister will continue the previous Government's progress in this area and commission a detailed report on amending and extending the social welfare free schemes <Col N="1361" /> to widowed people.  I presume it would cost a great deal of money but it would be money well spent.  I know of widows and widowers struggling to live on the survivor's pension at a difficult time and who wish to work but cannot afford to pay a babysitter.  Will the Minister accept the amendment and continue the good work done by his predecessor on behalf of survivors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.  The announcement that widowers would qualify was widely welcomed.  The extension of the free schemes &mdash; telephone rental, electricity and travel &mdash; would mean so much to survivors, particularly to those with young children who have to make extraordinary sacrifices.  Very often what widows need is practical help.  I was made aware of this through the widows and widowers association.  In the maintenance of the house for instance, widows need to avail of the services of a handyman to change window panes or fix tiles on the roof, tasks performed by their partners and which they took for granted.  This is an expensive process.</P>

      <P>The telephone provides a lifeline, particularly for those who are housebound.  The extension of the telephone rental allowance would allow them to stay in touch.  One of the most inventive and innovative schemes ever introduced was the free travel scheme as it gave pensioners independence.  The extension of the scheme to widows and widowers would mean so much, particularly to those with children of school-going age who have to make extraordinary sacrifices and who need special support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are similar. Hence, I will have no difficulty in supporting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows and widowers are the forgotten people.  They are not treated fairly by the State. They get a raw deal.  I know of a man with three small children whose wife died in tragic circumstances following a short illness.  He earns about £25,000 per year.  My colleague, Deputy Barnes, spoke about the things we take for granted.  As he had to continue working, he had to find someone to look after his children, a task performed by his wife and which he took for granted.  This was an added expense.  What was the response of the State?  He had to pay an additional £50 per week in income tax.  I take my hat off to the Government for increasing in the case of widows with children the special allowance in the first year after bereavement to £5,000 which will be phased out over a five year period.  It should continue to be available for as long as their children remain dependent on them.  We are talking about <Col N="1362" /> a relatively small number of people who are extremely vulnerable.</P>
    <P>These are minor proposals.  A widow or widower with dependent children would not use the free travel pass very often.  On the free electricity allowance, on a cold winter's night they would know they could be more generous when it comes to heating.  On the free telephone rental allowance, Deputy Barnes made an important point. The telephone provides a lifeline.  Widows and widowers would know that there was somebody they could talk to and contact if they needed a helping hand.</P>
    <P>We are placing many demands on the Minister but his heart is in the right place.  I hope he will be able to respond to many of the proposals included on our wish list.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support the amendments as there is a need to provide greater support for widows.  There was a good discussion on the radio this morning, which was chaired by a political correspondent based in Leinster House, on the needs of working wives.  I appreciate that working wives have their problems and difficulties but widows deserve much more than we give them.  It is easy to make demands but an exception should be made for widows when it comes to social welfare payments.  My colleague, Deputy McGrath, said the Minister's heart is in the right place.  Widows have a lonely life.  Anything that can be done to provide them with some comfort should be done.  The Minister will not be able to solve the problem in one year but I hope he will bear in mind what has been said in their defence.</P>

      <P>Widows should be given priority when it comes to the provision of support.  There are approximately 200,000 widowed persons in the State, two-thirds of whom are aged 65 years and over and one-quarter of whom are liable for income tax.  In many ways we are talking about people who are not exceptionally well treated.  In some instances, they are badly treated. As mentioned by my colleagues, following the loss of their partner, there is a substantial loss of family income.  The purpose of this amendment is to highlight the position of those in that category and to bring it home to the Minister and his officials that widows should be given reasonable consideration when there is largesse to be dispensed.  I have no doubt that some of our proposals will cost money and I am sure the Minister is justified when he says he does not have sufficient finance.  If he does not have it now, he should think about them the next time he has money to spend.</P>

      <P>As announced in the budget, people in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions, for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions, will retain their entitlement to free <Col N="1363" /> schemes.  This measure will extend the current arrangements which allow for invalidity pensioners who transfer either to retirement pension at the age of 65 or widow's and widower's contributory pension at the age of 60 or over to retain their free schemes.</P>
      <P>The cost of extending the free schemes to all widows and widowers not currently qualified would entail additional expenditure of £25 million.  I gave the figures on Committee Stage of how it is broken down.  There are 97,340 widows and widowers on contributory pension of whom approximately 7.5 per cent are men.  They have 16,600 child dependants.  There are 1,680 widows and widowers in receipt of one parent family payment and they had 3,325 child dependants as of December 1997.  There are 18,786 people on widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>We looked at the situation in relation to widows in the budget.  Approximately two thirds of widows and widowers &mdash; 65 per cent or 73,000 &mdash; will benefit from the £5 increase payable from the first week of June and 38,000 will benefit from the £3 increase per week.  The total cost of these increases is £15.7 million this year and £26 million in a full year.  There was also another slight amendment to the means test for widow's or widower's non-contributory pension by providing that rental income from a person living with the pensioner will be disregarded.</P>
      <P>As a recognition of the difficulties experienced by people when they lose a spouse, the Minister for Finance gave generous tax allowances in the budget.  Apart from widening the tax bands, he also introduced a widowed parent bereavement allowance.  The existing special bereavement allowance for widowed parents in the tax years following the tax year of bereavement is £1,500 in year one, £1,000 in year two, £500 in year three and nil thereafter.  This allowance in the budget is being increased to £5,000 in year one, £4,000 in year two, £3,000 in year three, £2,000 in year four, £1,000 in year five and nil thereafter with effect from 6 April 1998.  This is of substantial assistance to widowed people, albeit those who are paying tax.</P>
      <P>One of the compelling reasons the payment was increased by £5, particularly for people over 66 years of age, was to give them an added bonus in their payment.  I accept the convincing arguments made by the Deputies but we can only work within the finances available at any particular time.  I cannot wave a magic wand and fix it in one budget.  Former Ministers for Social Welfare have also had to address this issue.  The £5 and £3 increases for widows and widowers were substantial.  Other small initiatives in my area as well as the tax bereavement allowance introduced by the Minister for Finance will help in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  My amendment deals with the extension of free schemes to widows and widowers.  While I accept that improvements have <Col N="1364" /> been made, I ask the Minister to keep widows and widowers at the top of his agenda in the context of the next budget.  If a widow or widower had the free telephone allowance, it might make the difference between keeping in touch with their family or not.  The free telephone allowance is a luxury.  I do not expect the Minister to deliver on this tonight but it is important to keep widows and widowers at the top of his agenda when money becomes available.  The Celtic tiger should mean it is possible to introduce at least one allowance.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the free schemes particularly to young widows and widowers who have children.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  &mdash;The Minister shall consider the implications of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) establishing a £1,000 Carers' Respite Allowance payable to all carers including those who are presently excluded by the means test, and</P>
      <P>(b) increasing the present weekly income disregard from £150 to £200 per week,</P>
      <P>and shall report to Dáil Éireann on this matter within 3 months of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people were disappointed by the budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, but those who suffered the greatest disappointment were the carers.  Because many politicians listened and agreed to the reasonable case made by them, they expected a positive answer.  The verdict of the Carers Association on the budget is significant.  It stated that there was an unprecedented sense of hurt by carers at the proposals concerning them in the budget.  That is why these amendments were tabled.  Carers are getting a raw deal.  I am pleased there is a carer's allowance.  In an earlier manifestation I was involved in discussions about the introduction of that allowance as opposed to the old prescribed relative allowance.  The problem is the carer's allowance is far too limited.  It is estimated that approximately 30,000 carers provide full time in-home care for loved ones 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with no holidays, no sick pay or benefits or entitlements.  Approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 carers qualify for the carer's allowance. It is not fair that two-thirds of carers do not qualify for any benefit.  Families and individuals who <Col N="1365" /> provide care for their dependant family members deserve State support.  In many ways one could argue the State saves significantly by not having to provide residential care.  I know of many cases where relatives, who are not even direct descendants, say, nieces or nephews have cared for relatives in their homes in situations of great hardship.  That is to be commended, but it must also be supported.  It is not supported sufficiently.</P>
    <P>While every home situation varies, there is a common thread of additional effort, expense and hardship in caring for an infirm or disabled individual.  The Fine Gael proposal is that we should recognise that and introduce a recognition payment, a carer's respite allowance, which should be paid to all carers.  I do not propose the elimination of the conditions applying to the carer's allowance.  I refer to the carer who looks after a person who needs full time care and attention and is excluded from the carer's allowance on restrictive means grounds.  There are many people in that category.  They could be disqualified on grounds of means from another social welfare pension.  The carer could have a widow's pension and be barred from qualifying for benefit in respect of the relative for whom she is caring.  It is not unreasonable that we should recognise this position by introducing a £1,000 respite carer's allowance payable to all carers including those who are currently excluded by the means test. The case for that allowance can be made on social and on economic grounds.  It would encourage people to keep a relative at home and thus avoid the expense of residential care which could be up to £10,000 per year.  That proposed allowance is justified on all grounds.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the case I am making is to try to encourage more people to qualify for the existing carer's allowance by relaxing the means test.  I am in agreement with the case made by the Carers Association which suggests that the disregard of income for the carer's allowance should be increased from £150 per week to £200 per week.  That reduction would enable an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 carers to qualify for the allowance and the figure may be higher and some might qualify for a reduced rate of allowance.  The cost involved for the Exchequer would be relatively low and it would provide additional direct income support to carers.</P>
    <P>Carers will continue their work until they are properly looked after and we have a duty and responsibility to them.  Fine words do not butter bread.  It is good that their work is recognised, but we must provide the butter for the bread, even in the modest quantity I proposed.  An allowance of £1,000 per year is only £20 a week and that is not too much to expect for those who are providing such an important service not only for the aged and the infirm but for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has made a strong case to reward carers who provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.  They do great work, but are our unsung <Col N="1366" /> heroes and many of them are excluded from financial reward from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The measures put forward in this amendment will give a small recognition to the tens of thousands of carers who do not qualify for any payment and to those who may qualify if the means test were changed.  A disregard of £150 per week is small when one takes account of real jobs.  If the spouse of a person caring for a mother or a mother-in-law earns approximately £290 gross per week, that carer will be excluded from any payment under the carer's allowance.  That is quite a low income and that disregard needs to be substantially changed. The figure of £290 per week is comparable to the average industrial wage, but many people do not earn that wage and do Trojan work at home. They feel excluded and that the State does not recognise their work.  If carers were to put their relatives in nursing homes the State would look after them, but it will not reward carers for looking after them in their homes.  I hope the Minister will respond positively to this proposal.  The first sentence of the letter Members received from the Carers Association after the budget states that there was an unprecedented sense of hurt among carers at the proposals concerning them in the budget.  It needs to be addressed.  I hope in the next budget the Minister will be able to provide something substantial for carers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this proposal.  It is invidious to distinguish between one sector of carers such as parents and others, but those who provide care for an elderly or invalid relative, whether a brother, mother or sister, who may have given up their employment to do that work and provide care on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year deserve special attention.  We should not take with a grain of salt the letter from the Carers Association after the budget which declared there was a sense of hurt. I believe that was a genuine sense of hurt.  That is not to deny the Minister introduced concessions in respect of free travel, but that was more a case of having to do something for the carers having used all the resources in other areas.  We had to give a nod in the direction of carers otherwise the roof would have come in on top of us.  I do not know of any other area of social welfare other than the carer's allowance where there is such support for making major changes.  There is a need to change the means test and to look seriously at residential qualification and the provision of respite care.  Respite care comes under another Department but the Minister informed us previously that a joint report by the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Health and Children is due.  I have no doubt it will make recommendations which will require a fundamental review of how carers are treated and I hope serious thought will be given to implementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue will not go away.  There is a strong case on economic grounds, leaving aside the <Col N="1367" /> humanitarian issue, for ensuring carers are adequately supported by society.  In the context of the economic argument if one were to triple the carer's allowance and provide respite care, one would still not come near the cost of putting a person into a nursing home.  I acknowledge it is not possible to care for everybody at home and there will always be people for whom it will be impossible to care in the home.  People reach a stage where the carer simply cannot cope any longer or the health of the person being cared for simply declines to such an extent that he or she cannot be cared for at home.  There will always be a need for residential care but given the way in which society is developing and the ageing population, we need to get to grips now with how we will provide for them.</P>
    <P>The Carers' Association, in its pre-budget submission, suggested a carer's benefit scheme to be introduced for workers taking leave to care at home.  I am proud that I formulated this proposal while I was in the Department and was hopeful of having the opportunity of seriously doing something about it.  It would cost £50 million to implement it and require a 1 per cent rise in the rate of employer's PRSI.  If that was shared among employers, it would be more beneficial but it should be seriously looked at because some of the benefits which people received for their PRSI contributions are outdated.</P>
    <P>It is always risky for a politician to pinpoint a benefit that should be removed but the death benefit paid out is tiny.  It is useless in enabling a relative to bury a loved one.  It is no longer of value as it was introduced when people did not have the resources to bury their dead.  People died younger and death among young people, in particular, was more frequent.  We should look at what new benefits are necessary, such as a carer's benefit, while looking at how the benefit system should be structured.</P>
    <P>Priority is given to the 30,000 or so who provide full-time care.  The living under one roof regulations and the home-maker scheme should be extended to carers, for instance, where a person takes time out of work to care for a child.  It should also apply to a person who cares for an incapacitated person.  This is a valuable proposal which would not cost anything until the person retired.  It is estimated the carer's allowance should be £40 per week.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance and support for carers should have priority.  There are many other priorities and issues are constantly elbowed on to the agenda.  Credit will not be given to any Government, no matter which parties are involved in it, if this issue is not tackled in the relatively near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of my amendment deals with the calculation of means on the basis of net rather than gross earnings and the second deals with the increase in the disregard of income from £150 to £200 per week. <Col N="1368" /> I support the amendment on the carer's respite allowance tabled by my colleagues.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is very restricted with the result that many carers who look after the ill and incapacitated are still completely ignored.  When the economy is so vibrant it is very difficult to understand how people who give up their working lives to look after incapacitated individuals are still ignored.  A huge number of anomalies in the carer's allowance were pointed out on Committee Stage and they will have to be looked at.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Carers' Association as the people involved in it are very reasonable and caring.  Many of them have gone through the mill looking after ill people.  We know of many instances where young people get cancer, live for a number of months and people give up jobs to care for them.  Carers do not receive recognition because of the anomalies that exist with the result that money is not the only issue as they are left at home to look after sick people and provide very high levels of care.  On Committee Stage I suggested the Minister should consult his colleague in the Department of Health and Children.  The money saved by that Department on carers would make up the amount sought by us.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that so many carers are not recognised for their work.  Men and women look after elderly parents, sick children and spouses and it is ridiculous that provision cannot be made for them.  Those being cared for must be taken into account as they are entitled to the dignity of being looked after and dying in their homes and communities.  Many elderly people want to die at home as it is the place in which they are most comfortable.  Hospitals can do no more for them in many cases and the best people to look after them are their own.  Will the Minister consider the amendments and deal with them as a matter of urgency?  Carers usually look after people for a short time but it is difficult for them.  This is of vital importance and I plead with the Minister to take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is consensus about this issue as it is not party political.  We all know people who have made extraordinary sacrifices to care for an elderly relative at home.  Some of them gave up their career, pension and promotion opportunities.  In addition to the benefits, we must take into account the financial implications for carers.  Traditionally the single unmarried daughter was expected to look after her elderly relatives.  Having passed up the opportunity to have her own home, she then had to divide the family home with the other family members who probably made a small contribution to caring for their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the interdepartmental group to review this area.  The assistance provided by outside health agencies to carers is extraordinarily restricted.  For example, a house call by a physiotherapist could prevent a person being put into residential care.  I know people who have had to fight major battles to have oxygen <Col N="1369" /> tanks brought to the home so that the elderly relative does not have to be brought to hospital. Carers should be given adequate support services so that their sick and elderly relatives do not have to be put into residential care.  This would also ensure huge savings for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I will not labour the point further as we are all aware that carers are the most forgotten and taken for granted group in society.  I ask the Minister to lobby other Ministers to ensure this budget is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Having listened to the previous contributions, it is not easy to put forward an original idea.  I first raised this issue when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare and the allowance was £6.  While there have been improvements in the meantime, when one considers that some people give up jobs to look after the elderly and the huge cost of keeping these people in hospital, it is indefensible to say to carers that they will not get an adequate allowance for the marvellous work they do.  Carers give a wonderful service to the elderly and reduce the demand for hospital beds.  It is economic madness not to ensure these elderly people are cared for at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the points made by the Deputies opposite about the Carers' Association.  The carer's allowance was increased by £5 and £3 in the budget.  There were also other improvements, two of which were of a technical nature.  All Members had received representations about the overly restrictive way the travel pass scheme was being operated.  The granting of a free travel pass to carers has been acknowledged by the Carers' Association as a significant improvement.</P>
      <P>Following the budget I had a very good meeting with the Carers' Association at which I offered it an input to the interdepartmental working group set up by my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, to review this area.  There was a view that the carer's allowance, properly introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Woods, in 1990 in response to the growing demand that recognition be given to the work carried out by carers, was not sufficient.  Many of us know from experience the sacrifices made by people who care for their relatives at home.  Regardless of what we do, we will never fully compensate them for the lost opportunities, income and life they would otherwise have had.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the saving carers make to the State by looking after their relatives at home.  All the arguments in this regard have been very well made.  Caring for people at home is a facet of society that has changed in recent times and it will change even further in the coming years.  Previously there was someone at home to look after an elderly relative or infirm child.  However, due to changes in society this is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance was introduced in 1990 by the then Minister, Deputy Woods, in recognition of <Col N="1370" /> the work carried out by carers.  The valid view in the Department is that the allowance has been in place for a number of years and it is time to look at how best to proceed in this area.  The interdepartmental body was set up because this is broader than a Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs issue.  I do not say this in an effort to pass the matter on to another Department.  However, the issue is interdepartmental and will have to be addressed in that way.  For example, there are elements which involve the Department of Health and Children and the agencies under its remit.  I offered the Carers Association a direct input to the departmental working group reviewing this area.  They now have that direct line.  I also undertook to meet them on a regular basis between now and the next budget and I am due to meet them in the near future.  In my speech on the budget I said that, in view of the concerns they validly expressed to me, I reviewed the operation of the full-time care and attention condition and decided before Second Stage of this Bill to adopt a more flexible approach.  I have now decided that carers can attend education or training courses or participate in voluntary or community-based activities for about 10 hours per week, provided that the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his or her absence.  These new measures will come into effect almost immediately.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium, we committed ourselves progressively to relax the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers benefit under the scheme and to increase the value in real terms of the allowance.  We did the latter in the budget and we decided to wait until the review of the scheme was completed before looking at it again.  I made certain commitments in my speech on the last budget which I intend to implement as far as I can in the context of the next budget in December.  It is expected the review will be available in the near future &mdash; I have asked my Department to expedite it as quickly as possible &mdash; and we will then look at the issues raised in it with a view to doing as much as we can in the budgetary context. The cost of the respite care &mdash; £30,000 &mdash; mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe would be £30 million if paid to all carers.  The cost of raising the income disregard from £150 to £200 per week is approximately £3.6 million.</P>
    <P>I have already given a commitment to the Carers Association and in my speech on the budget that in light of what comes from the review and of the budgetary conditions I will do what I can about this issue.  I would like to think the review will point the way forward for my Department and the Department of Health and Children on the broader issue of care for people in the home.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ryanair Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for taking the debate.</P>
      <P>I regret having to again raise the matter of the dispute between Ryanair and its baggage handlers who are members of SIPTU.  Like everyone else, I warmly welcomed the announcement by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on 8 March that an inquiry team had been appointed under section 39(2) of the Industrial Relations Act to look into the dispute, a development which facilitated a return to work and allowed Dublin Airport to return to normal.  Although I raised the dispute on a number of previous occasions and was critical of the tactics of Ryanair management, I have made no public comment on the dispute since that weekend because I believe the inquiry team should be allowed get on with its work and seek a reasonable settlement to what everyone acknowledges is one of the most difficult disputes in recent years.</P>
      <P>We all recall the serious disruption to travel and the economy when the dispute resulted in the closure of Dublin Airport on the weekend of March 7 and 8.  Nobody wants to see Dublin Airport closed.  There are, however, worrying signs that Ryanair might not be serious about the inquiry and might provoke a further outbreak of industrial hostilities at the airport.  The general officers of SIPTU state in a letter today to the Taoiseach:</P>
      <P>Since that date [8 March] we have become increasingly concerned that Ryanair management are not interested in fair or reasonable procedures but are determined to use any and every measure possible to frustrate the efforts of the inquiry team and to demoralise and intimidate the union members involved.</P>
      <P>It was very clear to most people observing events over the weekend of 7 and 8 March that Ryanair management was very reluctant to give any undertaking that the company would co-operate with the inquiry.  There were reports that the Taoiseach had great difficulty in persuading Ryanair to participate in the inquiry.  Concerns were intensified by the fact that the previously silent and barely visible Mr. O'Leary was suddenly on virtually every news programme giving very contentious interpretations of the terms of the settlement to which the company and the union had agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there must now be serious doubt as to whether Ryanair was ever serious about cooperating with the inquiry team and making a genuine attempt to find a settlement of the dispute. <Col N="1375" />  A series of provocative actions over the past week appear to have been designed to provoke the union and to scuttle the efforts of the inquiry team.  The letter from the SIPTU officers states:</P>
    <P>Since our members resumed normal working we have seen legal recourse to injunction, selective payment of tax paid bonuses, inflammatory management circulars, legal pressure on the inquiry team and, now, the peremptory dismissal of three baggage handlers without any representation, consideration or right of appeal.  We see these actions as deliberately provocative in a highly charged and sensitive industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>No matter how the company attempts to dress up its action in less offensive terms, the indisputable fact is that three workers have been sacked in clear breach of the terms of the agreement which both management and union had accepted, specifically the undertaking that there would be no victimisation by either side.  There is no more provocative action that could be taken at this stage in such a sensitive dispute than to dismiss three of the employees who had been involved in the industrial action.  This was a calculated act taken in the hope and expectation that it would provoke the union into an immediate renewal of industrial action and thus effectively scuttle the work of the inquiry team.  I welcome the fact that the response of SIPTU to this provocation has been responsible and restrained.</P>
    <P>The agreement which led to a resumption of normal working on 9 March was brokered as a result of intervention by members of the Government at the highest level.  On 8 March the Taoiseach wrote to SIPTU regarding the terms of the agreement and stated: &ldquo;We are strongly of the view that they represent a fair and reasonable basis for a resumption of normal working as well as for the completion of the inquiry&rdquo;.  A core element of that agreement was that there would be no victimisation.  No union could have agreed to a return to normal working without such an undertaking.  That undertaking has now been broken by the company and there is a clear obligation on those Ministers who brokered the agreement to intervene again to ensure that the company honours its commitment and that three employees are reinstated.  There is also an obligation on the Government to ensure that the efforts to find a settlement to this dispute are successful because if the inquiry process fails there will be an inevitable return to industrial action with all the potential damage which that entails for the airport and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for bringing this important matter to the attention of the Dáil and raising it on the Adjournment.  A central part of the return to work formula was that there would be no victimisation by either side and that any <Col N="1376" /> breach of this would be reported to the inquiry team of Phil Flynn and Dan McAuley.  It was always the case that after this difficult dispute the parties most closely involved would have a heightened sensitivity that any decisions taken against them or their interests would be perceived as victimisation.  That said, it is important to make clear to this House the Government's concern that there should be no victimisation as a consequence of this dispute and we are concerned that non renewal of contract at the end of probation is being perceived by some as precisely that kind of victimisation.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to attempt to adjudicate in the matter of the three baggage handlers who are being let go.  I am not privy to the facts.  It is precisely the kind of question that should be discussed calmly and devoid of emotion, with all the facts available.  I understand this matter has been drawn to the attention of the inquiry team by SIPTU and we should let Mr. Flynn and Mr. McAuley get on with their job and avoid having parallel discussion, even in this important Chamber.</P>
      <P>I have complete confidence in the wisdom and expertise of Phil Flynn and Dan McAuley, accepting that the present dispute will tax them to the utmost.  I am disappointed that what is an already difficult task of finding a long-term solution to the problem is made more difficult by the developments of yesterday and today, but I consider that to start off on a second front will not help the situation.  For that reason I ask the House to let the inquiry team pursue the issues.</P>
      <P>The parties must have regard to their rights and obligations under labour law, including unfair dismissals legislation.  I imagine that those who consider they might have a grievance will be aware of the appropriate machinery for pursuing their grievances.  I mention this without prejudice: the facts have not been made public.  All the parties agreed to the return to work formula.  If there is a breach of the formula we have a mechanism to explore it and I would expect the inquiry team to deal with this issue.  They are the people in the best position to pursue the matter.</P>
      <P>What was agreed on 9 March was a balanced package which, as the Taoiseach said at the time, represented a fair and reasonable basis for a resumption of normal working as well as for the completion of the inquiry.  It behoves all the parties who agreed to the return to work formula to adhere to the spirit as well as the letter of that formula.  I and the Tánaiste look forward to receiving a copy of the inquiry team's report into all of the issues involved as soon as practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to answer this Adjournment matter.  I have raised the issue of step-down accommodation at the Bon Secours Hospital, Tuam, with two chief executive officers at the <Col N="1377" /> Western Health Board and with two Ministers for Health.</P>
      <P>The Bon Secours sisters in Tuam have issued a statement in which they propose facilities at their Tuam hospital which would complement the services of other health care providers within the region.  The statement confirms that the hospital management is exploring a number of alternative options for the future of the hospital, with discussions currently taking place with the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The hospital staff and the local GPs have been advised that the future role of the hospital is under review.  According to a statement in the <i>Tuam Herald,</i> discussions with the Western Health Board are centred on a number of proposals.  These include sub-acute or step-down beds at the hospital in conjunction with University College Hospital, Galway.  This would significantly assist in relieving pressure on beds at UCHG.  The service would operate in a most cost efficient and effective manner, based on the existing infrastructure and other services currently available in Tuam.</P>
      <P>The plans would allow for GP access to sub-acute beds and relevant diagnostic services.  This would allow for the provision of a small number of protected beds for public patients, significantly enhancing the services which GPs provide to the local community and further reducing pressure on the high-tech beds at UCHG.  Another suggestion is for facilities for clinics and/or support services with the community hospital concept in mind, providing an expanded range of outpatient clinics, including physiotherapy and other services.</P>
      <P>The Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam employs more than 50 staff and has a patient throughput of approximately 1,000 per annum from Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  The Bon Secours sisters have been running the hospital for 50 years and are very encouraged by the continuing high level of support from staff and the local community.  I know this from speaking with the matron, Sister Baptist Liddy.</P>
      <P>Doctors from the Tuam area and civic and community groups in the town have given their support to the campaign that is now in motion to ensure that the Bon Secours Hospital remains viable <i>via</i> the possibility of having a combination of public and private patients.  At a number of meetings proposals have been made to include the use of the hospital as a step-down facility for relieving some of the overcrowding at UCHG. Other suggestions include the potential to cater for the elderly population in the area &mdash; the older generation is very vulnerable &mdash; especially in respect of treatment for illnesses such as pneumonia or where a geriatrician could call on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the GPs suggestion of greater use of the hospital for physiotherapy or the introduction of a children's outpatients department. Another suggestion was that it might be possible to have an outpatients emergency or casualty <Col N="1378" /> department which could deal with less serious accident and emergency cases at weekends for the north Galway and south Mayo areas.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, County Galway does not have a district hospital network, such as is available in County Mayo.  We need a facility in Tuam similar to the facility in Athlone or Ballina.  The Bon Secours Hospital and the surrounding grounds are included in the urban renewal designation for Tuam.  There is great potential for the development of the facilities there.  I hope we can all work together to provide the health services I mentioned.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State and the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.  The Bon Secours is a private hospital and, therefore, does not come under the auspices of my Department.  The provision of health services in the Tuam area is a matter for the Western Health Board and the question of the possible use by the public health services of accommodation in the Bon Secours hospital is a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the board and, at the instigation of the authorities of the Bon Secours hospital, discussions have taken place with the management of the board regarding the availability of surplus accommodation in the hospital. These discussions centred on the possible future use of this accommodation.  During the meetings between the Bon Secours management and the board, some service options were discussed but, as these discussions were only of an exploratory nature, no specific options were targeted.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the management of the Bon Secours hospital and the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board will take place within the next few weeks at which the options will be further explored.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that I am not in a position at this stage to indicate the outcome of these discussions.  However, I will ask the chief executive officer of the board to keep the Deputy informed of developments.  I note with interest the many and varied aspects of the potential of this hospital and I am sure the Western Health Board will take them on board.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch díot as ucht an t-am a thabhairt dom chun an t-ábhar seo a phlé agus táim buioch den Aire Stáit a tháinig anseo chun freagra a thabhairt.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil eolas ag an Aire Stáit ar Bhéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh atá i lár Ghaeltacht Mhúscraí.  Tá suim mhór ag muintir na háite sa Ghaeilge agus tá Coláiste na Mumhan &mdash; an chéad choláiste Gaeilge in Éirinn i lár an bhaile.  Is í an fhadhb ná go bhfuil réamhmhonarcha folamh le blianta fada anuas agus tá an-chuid daoine ón gceantar taréis imeacht go dtí bailte móra timpeall na háite cosúil le Magh <Col N="1379" /> Chromtha agus Beanntraí agus go dtí bailte móra ar nós Corcaigh agus Baile Átha Cliath chomh maith.  Tá siad imithe chomh maith go Sasana agus go dtí áiteanna eile ar fud an domhain ag lorg obair.  Ach caithfimid obair a chur ar fáil i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh féin agus dá bhrí sin bhéinn buíoch den Aire dá mbeadh sé in ann airgead nó cabhair éigin a thabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta chun tionscal éigin a chur isteach sa réamhmhonarcha.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this subject and I am particularly pleased that the Minister is here to reply.</P>
      <P>Ballingeary is the heart of the Muskerry Gaeltacht in my constituency.  Situated in the village is the first all-Irish college established in the State to which pupils come from all over the country.  I am sure many people in this House learnt Irish there in the past.</P>
      <P>There is a great interest in the language in the area but, unfortunately, all too many of the younger people in the locality are forced to leave Ballingeary in search of employment.  Many of them are fortunate to have found employment in relatively nearby larger towns like Macroom and Bantry.  Some have found employment in the Gaeltacht area of Ballyvourney where there has been considerable success in attracting industry.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to investigate with Údarás na Gaeltachta the reasons it has proved particularly difficult over many years to secure an industry for this vacant advance factory.  If the Irish language is to have a future in the locality we have to provide employment opportunities for the young people of the area.  Unfortunately and regrettably all too many of them have been forced to emigrate in recent years.  A large number of them would be anxious to return to Ballingeary if suitable employment was available in the locality.  I would be grateful for any assistance the Minister can give to Údarás na Gaeltachta which has been working diligently in this area in recent years.</P>
      <P>I accept also that there is a problem in Ballingeary relative to the other industrial sites in the Muskerry Gaeltacht, because the infrastructure is not as good.  Ballyvourney is located on a national primary route whereas Ballingeary is on a poor secondary road.  That is a disadvantage, but in an age of high-tech industries it is not necessary to have national primary routes in every location to attract industry.  I am sure there are industries which would be particularly suited to areas like Ballingeary if we could muster sufficient energy over a concerted period to show the area off to prospective industrialists.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful for any assistance the Minister can give in this regard.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta Creed as ucht na ceiste seo a árdú sa Teach tráthnóna.  Chuir mé spéis sa mhéid a bhí <Col N="1380" /> le rá aige maidir le bunú Choláiste na Mumhan mar tharla sé go raibh mo shean-athair Seán Ó Cuív ar dhuine de bhunaitheoirí an Choláiste.  Ní hamháin sin ach chaith mé féin trí thréimhse ann ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ag deireadh na gcaogadaí agus ag tús na seascadaí.  Tá eolas agam ar an gceantar agus baint an-fhada ag mo mhuintir leis an gceantar áirithe sin.  Mar sin tá bá faoi leith agam leis an gceantar agus ba mhaith liom go dtiocfadh an ceantar chun cinn.  Ar ndóigh, is gnó é seo go bunúsach d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, an t-eagras Stáit atá freagrach as forbairt tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus níl ról agamsa mar Aire go díreach sa chás.  Ach é sin ráite tá mé sásta an t-eolas atá faighte agam ón Údarás a chur faoi bhráid an Tí.  Tuigim ón Údarás go bhfuil breis is 45 duine fostaithe go lán-aimsire agus 22 duine páirt-aimsireach í dtionscail i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás.  Tuigim freisin go bhfuil monarcha amháin 890 méadar cearnach folamh le tamall fada anuas.  Ceadaíodh togra le sprioc fostaíochta de 40 don mhonarcha seo i 1996 ach tuigim nach bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh anois.  Tá feidhmeannaigh de chuid an Údaráis ag tabhairt tús áite do thogra nua a aimsiú don mhonarcha sin.  Ni miste a lua go dtuigeann an tÚdarás riachtanaisí fostaíochta an cheantair.  Bíonn teagbháil rialta idir an t-eagras agus ionadaithe ón gceantar.  Mar shampla, bhí cruinniú ar an 2 Feabhra ag Bainisteoir Réigiúnach an Údaráis le Coiste Forbartha Bhéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh chun a gcás a phlé.  Ar an Aoine seo caite, 20 Márta, bhuail an tÚdarás féin, a raibh cruinniú Boird acu sa cheantar an lá sin, leis an gCoiste Forbartha chun ceisteanna fostaíochta agus ábhair eile a phlé.  Tuigim gur chruinniú fiúntach a bhí ann agus tá súil agam go bhfuil tuiscint níos fearr ar an dá thaobh ar chonas mar a sheasann cúrsaí.  Ba mhaith liom a rá freisin go dtuigim an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta maidir le cúrsai infrastructúir agus tá mar chuid den abair atá ar bun ag mo Roinn i gcomhairle le ranna eile sa Choiste Idir-Rannach scrúdú a dhéanamh ar cheisteanna infrastructúir sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin ráite, tá ceantair eile atá chomh hiargcúlta le Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, mo cheantar féin in a measc, gur éirigh leis an Údarás le dea-thoil agus le cúnamh na ndaoine áitiúla go leor leor fostaíochta a chruthú.  Mar sin tá tábhacht leis an infrastructúr ach is féidir forbairt tionsalaí ochta a dhéanamh gan é.  Is mithid a lua freisin go bhfuil i gceist agam bualadh leis an gCoiste Forbartha fad is a bheidh mé sa cheantar ag tús mhí Aibreáin.  Tuigim ón Údarás go bhfuil tograí forbartha á bplé faoi láthair ag cúpla gnó atá lonnaithe sa cheantar ag súil le fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh toradh go han-luath ar chás amháin díobh ar a laghad.  Tá sé tábhachtach go n-oibreodh an tÚdarás agus an pobal as láimh a chéile chun na deiseanna is fearr is féidir a chur chun cinn, agus a chinntiú go mbeidh daoine ón gceantar oilte, ábalta agus toilteanach fostaíocht a bheadh le tairiscint amach anseo a ghlacadh.  Sílim féin gurb é sin eochar na ceiste ag deireadh an lae, an tÚdarás <Col N="1381" /> ag obair i gcomhairle leis an bpobal.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment which relates to the physical education hall at St. Mac Dara's community college in Templeogue. Anxiety regarding the construction of the hall has been ongoing for a number of years, but a certain level of progress has been made recently.</P>
      <P>A formal commitment was given on 6 April 1995 by the then Minister for Education to initiate the planning process for the development. That was three years ago and the project has dragged on in the intervening period.  A series of representations have been made by all the public representatives in the area and a number of statements and announcements have been made by various Ministers in recent years.  Two issues arise.  When will the project go to tender and when will construction commence?</P>
      <P>I emphasise to the Minister of State that there is an inordinate level of frustration and irritation among the parents of students at the school. Some parents are particularly dismayed because they anticipated that the development would have been available for their children some years ago.  However, their children have now left the school and did not have the benefit of the hall. There is a huge need for the facility in the area and I ask the Minister of State to give urgent consideration to the two questions which I pose on behalf of the parents and the community in Templeogue.  When will the project go to tender and when will construction commence?  I hope the Minister of State can give me a favourable response to these questions which are of major concern to the parents and the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department's position regarding the construction of a PE hall at the school.  I wish to give some background details relating to the provision of a physical education hall at the school in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The school opened in September 1982 &mdash; the same year I entered the House &mdash; to cater for a long-term enrolment of 1,000 pupils.  At that time, due to the exceptionally heavy demands on available capital resources, priority had to be given to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  As a result, it was not possible to allocate funds towards the provision of a PE hall.</P>
    <P>However, in 1996 it was decided to initiate the architectural planning for the facility.  The outline sketch scheme was requested from the County Dublin VEC's design team in April 1996 and it was received in the building unit of my Department in September of that year.  Additional technical work then had to be undertaken by the design team and this was submitted in early 1997.</P>
    <P>The detailed design and contract documents were received by my Department in October 1997.  Following examination by my Department's technical staff, it was clear that the cost plan for the hall was substantially in excess of the Department's upper limits and the County Dublin VEC's design team was requested to achieve reductions and bring the cost plan down to a level acceptable to my Department.  The County Dublin VEC has recently forwarded additional information to my Department relating to the costs and this is being examined.  As soon as the matter has been resolved, the project will be allowed to go to tender.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the PE hall at the school is one of a large volume of projects being dealt with by the technical staff of my Department.  In these circumstances, delays in the planning process are inevitable.  Because of the substantial and continuing demands on the capital allocation, cost controls must be rigidly applied in order to maximise the number of projects proceeding to construction.  I am confident that the problem relating to cost in this case can be rapidly overcome so that the project can proceed to tender and then to construction as early as possible this year.  I presume this is a satisfactory response for the Deputy.  As he stated, many representations were made by the public representatives in the area about the project.  The Department regards it as an important project and will do its utmost to ensure it is expedited.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.46 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 March 1998.</P>

      <P>The current EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, with the earlier corresponding programme, has made a major contribution to the recent significant growth in Irish tourism in terms of foreign revenue earnings and job creation.  Between the two programmes, covering the decade 1989-99, over £1 billion of investment is anticipated to take place, leading to a transformation in the range, quality and volume of tourism product available and a major boost to international tourism marketing and training.</P>
      <P>In recent months my Department has been developing an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funding, 2000-2006.  The strategy includes a vision for the future, key objectives and targets and a proposed strategic approach under the product, marketing and training headings.  Consultations are due to take place soon with the industry aimed at developing a shared approach for the future.</P>
      <P>To meet the challenges that lie ahead and to complement action taken by an increasingly self-reliant industry, the strategy will be to maintain a high level of investment across the three key areas of product, marketing and training.  This investment is compatible with EU priorities, including funding priorities.  The cornerstone of any future strategy must be the development of sustainable tourism, facilitating better asset and visitor management, greater regional spread and a programme rather than project based approach. In the marketing area, emphasis should be on destination marketing programmes to be carried out in an enhanced partnership between the EU, the industry and the State.  A new approach to training is also needed based on intensified industry efforts to enhance the image of the sector as an attractive career, graduated levels of support depending on company size and the creation of an active training culture within the industry itself.</P>

      <P>The tender procedure for a <Col N="1384" /> national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, and is being conducted in full compliance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997, and in the Irish media on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within this deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, &ldquo;Invitation to Tender&rdquo; documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was at 5 p.m. on Monday, 2 February.  Bord Fáilte received full tender submissions from five consortia, and immediately commenced its assessment of these submissions. The deliberations of Bord Fáilte and the management board are continuing and are expected to be finalised in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission, on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law, will then be required in respect of any final selection made.  It is hoped that the grant offer can be made to the successful candidate by mid-July, who will then be able to proceed with construction plans.</P>
      <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the Government and the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment I have been concentrating on the development of a comprehensive Government strategy on local development, with a particular focus on improving the quality of life of communities characterised by high levels of unemployment.  My work programme for the next four years will involve reviewing existing policies and their implementation to develop greater flexibility in the use of resources and to respond more effectively at a practical level to the needs of those areas.  Key elements of my work programme will include: overseeing the effective implementation of the Operational Programme <Col N="1386" /> for Local, Urban and Rural Development, in conjunction with Area Development Management Ltd., the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and the EU's URBAN initiative which operates in Ballymun-Finglas-Darndale; West Tallaght-Clondalkin and north Cork city; co-ordinating local development initiatives, through the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, of which I am chairperson; contributing to the preparation of proposals for EU funding for local development post-1999 including proposals for better integration between local development and local government systems nationwide in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; promoting the integrated development of the most disadvantaged urban communities by ensuring that their needs are addressed in a co-ordinated way; co-ordinating national drugs policy and overseeing the operation of the National Drugs Policy Group and the National Drugs Strategy Team.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee on local development has been given a specific policy mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.

      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.  To that end, the interdepartmental committee on local development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> The Pilot Project will target four areas, viz.:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dublin's North-East Inner City</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Canal Communities (Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House)</P>
    <P>&mdash;Jobstown, Tallaght</P>
    <P>&mdash;Togher, Cork.</P>
    <P>The initial stage of the project will involve consultation with local communities about the needs of their areas; profiling existing services and resources; identifying the extent of integration between them; and devising a framework to enhance co-ordination and integration efforts.</P>
    <P>A steering group comprising representatives from the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment and Local Government and from Area Development Management Limited has been established under the auspices of the interdepartmental committee on local development to oversee the project.</P>
    <P>Given ADM's experience in relation to partnerships and its knowledge of local communities, it has been given an important role in the day-to-day management of the project.  ADM has already consulted the relevant partnerships to ask for their support and co-operation in advancing the project and the response has been positive.</P>
    <P>At the operational level, ADM has advertised for a &ldquo;central co-ordinator&rdquo; to oversee the project's implementation.  Reports will be drawn up on the four areas, in consultation with the local communities.  It is intended that the co-ordinator will begin work in early April and that initial reports may be completed by July.</P>
    <P>I hope that final recommendations will go to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the autumn.  Action after that date will be determined by the nature of the recommendations and the decisions of the Cabinet committee.</P>

On Friday, 30 January, I publicly invited victims of O'Rourke to meet me.</P>

      <P>Members of the group outlined their experiences and their concerns about the handling of allegations of sexual abuse by the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, its Leinster branch and a named club.</P>
      <P>At the end of the meeting, a solicitor in attendance with the group outlined certain demands, including an inquiry into the administration of swimming in Ireland, having regard to the handling of child sexual abuse and the provision of counselling for victims who came forward.  As the meeting was held in private and the matters raised by the group are now the subject of an independent inquiry into sexual abuse in swimming, I am precluded from commenting further on the matter.</P>

      <P>On 15 March 1998, I announced planning details for Ireland's Millennium celebrations which will start with the St. Patrick's Festival in March 1999.  A millennium festival committee has been established to prepare the way for the formal incorporation of a Millennium <Col N="1391" /> Festival company, comprising representatives from the tourism, arts and commercial sectors.</P>
      <P>The company's aim will be to harness the talents and vision of some of Ireland's existing festivals and work with them to link together into a triumphant millennium celebration.  The Government will be providing £500,000 in 1998 to &ldquo;kick start&rdquo; the initiative, and to ensure that the celebration will be both accessible to and inclusive of diverse sectors of Irish society and, at the same time, attractive and welcoming to a broad range of visitors to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The precise role and terms of reference of the millennium festival company will be set out in the company's memorandum and articles of association which are currently being finalised.</P>

The Tourism Council, which I chair, is made up of representatives of the industry, the State agencies and relevant Government Departments.  The council acts as a national forum for consultation on tourism issues, and in an advisory capacity to me as Minister.</P>
      <P>Industry involvement is also a prominent feature of the arrangements for the operation of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, and the overseas tourism marketing initiative.  In summary, I am satisfied that the existing structures in place between my Department and the sector are such as to facilitate a good working relationship on matters of mutual interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its 1994 review of Bord Fáilte, Arthur D. Little Ltd., international consultants, concluded that the board suffered from a lack of trained marketeers and had few people with recent direct industry experience.  To fill skill gaps and become more closely aware of industry requirements, the consultants recommended that BFE hire a new international marketing director and introduce some new blood with recent industry <Col N="1394" /> experience and graduate level marketing skills.</P>
      <P>Following acceptance by the then Government of the conclusions in the Arthur D. Little review, a new international marketing director was appointed and, as part of a general staff reorganisation, a number of new marketing professionals was recruited by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The new team helped to oversee the development of the new tourism brand Ireland project which was launched in November 1996 and rolled out in all the main markets last year.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte's international marketing director left the organisation in November, 1997 to take up a position in the private sector.  By that time Tourism Brand Ireland had been fully deployed in the key markets.  Bord Fáilte's marketing plans for 1998 had also been developed and are currently in full operation with the objective of building further on our past tourism successes.</P>
      <P>Since the departure of the international marketing director, the board of Bord Fáilte has been addressing the senior management structure of the organisation.  It has now formulated proposals which it has developed not just in the context of the international marketing director post but in the wider context of the changing marketplace and how Bord Fáilte can best be positioned and resourced to serve future industry needs.</P>
      <P>Having recently had discussions with Arthur D. Little Ltd., I am at present considering the board's proposals in the context of my responsibilities under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  I intend to let the board have my views shortly.</P>

      <P>The European Council is currently discussing a draft directive which has the objective of protecting the consumer who purchases goods in the territory of another member state.  The proposal, when adopted, will introduce a uniform minimum number of elements which must be contained in the legal guarantee.  Specifically goods must: (a) comply with the description given by the seller and possess the qualities of the goods which the seller held out to the consumer as a sample or model; (b) be fit for any particular purpose for which the consumer requires them and which he made known to the seller at the time of conclusion of the contract, except where the circumstances show that the buyer did not rely on the seller's explanations; (c) be fit for the purposes for which goods of the same type are normally used; (d) show the quality and performance which are normal in goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect, given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statements on the specific characteristics of the goods made about them by the seller, the producer or his representative, particularly in advertising or on labelling.</P>
      <P>Any additional voluntary guarantee will legally bind the producer or seller under the conditions laid down in the guarantee and must meet certain transparency criteria.  It is hoped under the UK Presidency to reach a common position on the draft directive.</P>
      <P>A further measure under consideration relates to settlement proceedings for consumer disputes. The form and scope of such proceedings is still under debate.  When finalised, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure Ireland's obligations are fully met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for the supply of milk are governed by a large number of factors, including competition in the market.  A benefit of competition in the market is downward pressure on prices benefiting consumers.  Competition policy in the State is now governed by the Competition Act, 1991, and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Competition Act, 1991, prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State. Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides for public enforcement of the Competition Acts and for offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition.  The independent Competition Authority, which was established under the Competition Act, 1991, now has the power to bring civil and-or criminal proceedings in respect of breaches of the Competition Acts.  In the case of criminal proceedings the 1996 Act provides for fines of up to £3 million or 10 per cent of turnover for firms found in breach of the law, and for imprisonment for individuals. <Col N="1404" />  The 1996 Act also created the position of director of competition enforcement to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, also gave the Competition Authority the right to initiate investigations on its own initiative into any alleged anti-competitive structure or practice which appears to it to warrant such investigation.</P>
    <P>As a result of the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, there are now two alternative ways for an individual or firm to pursue allegations of breaches of competition rules: (i) take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or (ii) make a complaint to the director of competition enforcement requesting him to investigate alleged breaches(s) of competition law.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the merger of the Avonmore and Waterford co-operatives which I approved in 1997 has given rise to increased concentrations in the liquid milk market in Dublin and Leinster, and while there are clear dangers in concentrations in any busines sector, I am assured that the Avonmore and Waterford Group will live up to their statement to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of all legislation impinging on their behaviour in the market.</P>
    <P>In any event, the proactive powers of the director of competition enforcement are designed to ensure that there is no abuse of market position that is contrary to the interests of consumers and in breach of the Competition Acts.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has evidence of anti-competitive pricing practices or a cartel in the milk or any other sector he should bring it to the attention of the director of competition enforcement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to Question No. 91 on 24 February 1998, pending agreement on burden sharing arrangements for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at EU level, it will not be possible to determine the specific implications across the various sectors of the economy, including industry.</P>
      <P>In that context, the study currently being undertaken by the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which aims to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing and developing additional policies and measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is relevant.  Pending the outcome of that study and agreement at EU level, the issue of giving instructions to the industrial development agencies does not arise.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies and bodies within the remit of my Department which have direct responsibility for assessing projects for grant aid purposes take account of current environmental rules and regulations. Projects which receive grant aid are also subject to the requirements of planning law and Environmental Protection Agency regulations, which also address environmental concerns.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans to put the insurance ombudsman scheme on a statutory footing.  As I indicated in reply to Dáil questions on 18 February 1998, the operation of the insurance ombudsman service, under the auspices of the insurance industry, has proved an outstanding success as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  That <Col N="1408" /> success is due in no small measure to the dedication and expertise of the present ombudsman who has filled that position since the inception of the scheme in 1992 and who has developed the scope of the service to the mutual benefit of insurance consumers and providers.</P>
    <P>To ensure the independence of the ombudsman, the operation of the service is divided into three component parts.  The first is a board comprising executives who are elected from those insurers taking part in the scheme.  The second is a council made up of nominees from within and outside the insurance industry.  The council in the second part recruits and appoints the ombudsman, subject to the approval of the board in the first part.  The third part is the office of the ombudsman, where policyholder disputes are referred and resolved.  The member companies of the scheme are bound by the ombudsman's decisions.</P>
    <P>As Minister, my primary concern is to ensure, in the interests of the consumers as policyholders, that whoever holds the office of ombudsman is enabled to discharge the responsibilities of that office in accordance with the terms of reference. I will be meeting members of the council at their invitation to discuss the existing arrangements for the operation of the scheme, in light of the experience gained over the past five years and to satisfy myself that these arrangements are being operated in a way which enables the ombudsman to independently and effectively discharge the functions of the office in accordance with the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that individual insurers calculate employers' liability premium rates on the basis of their own underwriting experience, for particular business activities and the level of risk involved in such activities.  While certain categories of employment would of their nature be regarded as higher risk, for example, construction activity, there is no indication, in so far as our Department or the Irish Insurance Federation is aware, of any recent significant increases in the cost of insurance cover for employers in any particular subsector of economic activity.  If such increases were to occur they would be prompted by an increase in the frequency and cost of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland <Col N="1409" /> found that smaller companies are generally regarded by insurers as lacking in sophisticated safety management procedures and, therefore, represent a higher risk class than larger firms. Smaller firms are, therefore, charged higher premium rates and this places them at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Deloitte and Touche recommended that small businesses should establish or join affinity groups to strengthen their collective bargaining power with insurers and that they should seek to improve their risk management procedures through greater awareness of and compliance with health and safety standards.  Following these recommendations, a number of special affinity schemes have already been successfully established by, among others, the Construction Industry Federation and by publican, restaurateur and farmer groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, an affinity scheme for the services and self-employed sector of ISME was launched earlier this year, and these affinity schemes have assisted in alleviating the insurance cost burden borne by Irish businesses affiliated to these schemes.  An initiative by the IBEC-ICTU working group on safety in the workplace is aimed at improving safety management procedures among small firms.</P>

      <P>Competition policy in the State is governed by the Competition Act, 1991, and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, and the Competition Authority has the necessary powers to investigate, carry out an inquiry and enforce competition law.</P>
      <P>The rules of competition are set out in the Competition Act, 1991, section 4 of which prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their objects or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State. Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides for public enforcement of the Competition Acts and also for offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition.  The independent Competent Authority, which was established under the Competition Act, 1991, now has the power to bring civil and-or criminal proceedings <Col N="1410" /> in respect of breaches of the Competition Acts.  In the case of criminal proceedings, the 1996 Act provides for fines of up to £3 million or 10 per cent of turnover for firms found in breach of the law, and for imprisonment for individuals.  The 1996 Act also created the position of director of competition enforcement in the Competition Authority in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>Since the Competition (Amendment) Act also gave the Competition Authority the power to undertake, on its own initiative, a study and analysis of any practice or method of competition including any alleged anti-competitive structure or practice which appears to it to warrant such investigation or any alleged abuse of a dominant position, I am satisfied that this matter is for determination with the Authority.</P>
    <P>I have had correspondence from the person on whose behalf the Deputy has asked this question and that person has been advised of the options which are open in relation to pursuing allegations of breaches of the rules of competition.  These are: (i) take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or (ii) make a complaint to the director of competition enforcement requesting him to investigate alleged breach(s) of competition law.  The correspondence has also been brought to the attention of the director of competition enforcement and the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 to 86 inclusive, and 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The project in question has been receiving ongoing funding under the tourism angling measure, TAM, since early 1995 to date, with the important objective of rehabilitating the Corrib, Mask and Cara lakes as prime brown trout fisheries for domestic and tourism angling.  An application for additional funding for a further phase of development in 1998 has been submitted to the management committee of the TAM, which is chaired by the Central Fisheries Board and represents the relevant interests.  The committee is evaluating all projects in the context of a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the measure as a whole.  This review is essential at this stage of the programme to ensure TAM expenditure is delivering on set objectives, to assess financial outturns and planned expenditure, the nature and regional spread of projects which are being funded and the application of enhanced criteria in relation to the tourism impacts of individual projects.  I understand the management committee will take decisions on all projects in hand early next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acknowledge that the promoters of the western lakes project are anxious to begin work on the planned further phase of development, projects must receive prior approval before activity can proceed.  I understand that, pending <Col N="1412" /> the final decision of the mangement committee, and accommodation has been reached and no redundancies of contract staff employed on the project have occurred.</P>
    <P>Details of specific operational elements of the project, including species management and details of advertising and bookings, are a matter for the Western Regional Fisheries Board and the regional manager has been requested to supply the information sought directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the AGM of the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland on Sunday, 8 February 1998.  As I indicated at the time, I will be glad to meet the federation at a mutually convenient date to discuss its plans and concerns.</P>

      <P>The forest service of my Department issues guidelines which cover the use of chemicals in the context of the protection of the environment.  The forest service has also financed the publication of a manual entitled &ldquo;Guidelines for the use of herbicides in forestry&rdquo; which covers safety, herbicides in general use, their application and calibration, and is available to the sector.  I have made arrangements to furnish a copy of this publication to the Deputy.  The forest service's current operational procedures and standards refer forestry contractors to the health and safety legislation and direct users to be familiar with chemical manufacturer's instructions.</P>
      <P>The forest service also supports, through the European Social Fund, training courses for the forestry sector in the use of chemicals.  In addition, a code of best forest practice is being prepared within my Department which will cover all forestry operations, including the application, handling, storage and training required in the use of chemicals.  Compliance with the code, which I expect will be available by the end of this year, will be a condition of grant-aid for all afforestation projects and will apply equally to the private and public sectors.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to avail of every appropriate opportunity to support an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.  I have outlined the course of action being taken by the Government and our EU partners to achieve these objectives in my respective replies to Questions Nos. 21, 42, 61 and 76 of 19 March.  Our approach follows the relevant decision of the EU Council of Development Ministers on 28 November 1997 and is particularly focused on the continued plight of Ogoni and other political prisoners and the unacceptable lack of due process in their cases.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, 20 March, the Government and our European partners expressed our deep concern about human rights, political detainees and the process of democratisation in Nigeria in a declaration which marked the visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to that country.  In so doing, we called on the Nigerian authorities to take immediate steps to ensure the final stages of democratic transition are conducted in a manner which respects the rule of law and the Nigerian people's right to choose their own government and leaders in a free and unfettered way.  The Union also made its concerns known directly to the Vatican in advance of the Pope's visit.  These included recent actions by the security forces in Ogoniland, the whereabouts and health of Mr. Batom Mitee, brother of the Acting President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, and the fact that 20 further Ogonis are awaiting trail.  As part of his ongoing monitoring of the situation in Nigeria, the Irish Ambassador in Lagos recently met and was briefed by the President of the Niger Delta Human and Environment Rescue Organisation on the human rights and environmental justice situation in Ogoniland and the Niger Delta.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to support strongly, including at the forthcoming 54th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>It is also relevant to recall in this context that, in April 1995, the US formally declared to the United Nations Security Council that it would not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are parties to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty except in the unlikely event of an attack by a non-nuclear weapon state allied or associated with a nuclear weapons state against a nuclear weapon state or its allies.

I am aware of the press reports on the incident which indicate that in November 1996 a car crash occured near the town of Susurluk in western Turkey in which a top police official and a convicted heroin smuggler were killed and a member of the Turkish Parliament was injured. Allegations in the media suggested the existence of collaboration between senior political and military figures and known drug smugglers.</P>
      <P>Following the election of a new Turkish Government in June 1997, Prime Minister Yilmaz directed that an official investigation into the matter be undertaken.

      <P>I do not have any proposals to hold a conference in conjunction with the State agencies under my aegis in relation to the year 2000 problem.  All hardware and new software purchased by my Department since 1 January 1997 is the subject of a vendor guarantee that it is year 2000 compliant.  The normal system maintenance and projects carried out by my Department should ensure that most of the potentially non-compliant hardware and software will be replaced as a matter of course by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department's specific year 2000 programme, therefore, entails: obtaining guarantees from vendors on the compatibility of their software or hardware; obtaining the necessary upgrades and patches to software from vendors; slightly accelerating the Department's maintenance programme and scheduled projects to ensure all hardware and software for which vendors guarantees are not forthcoming are replaced by the year 2000; and implementing the necessary amendments to software which has been written or customised in house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the intention to rely exclusively on vendor assurances concerning hardware and software.  A testing programme is being set up which will be completed by end 1998 and will test a representaive sample of the major hardware <Col N="1418" /> and software which is in use in my Department. A survey is also being carried out of departmental office equipment other than IT systems to identify compatibility with year 2000 compliance.  All suppliers will be asked to provide a certificate of compliance for each item of equipment.</P>
    <P>With respect to the aspects of the Deputy's question which relate to the agencies under my aegis my Department is monitoring the progress these agencies are making in achieving year 2000 compliance, as part of the reporting arrangements that have been put in place by the Government's interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee.</P>

      <P>The power referred to by the Deputy is set out in section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  This provision was designed primarily to empower a Minister to ensure policy decisions of a general kind made by the Government are implemented and to ensure requirements in the national interest are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that this provision was ever meant to be used as a general regulatory power in relation to the telecommunications sector and I do not intend to confer such a power on the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  The <Col N="1419" /> director, through the transposition of EU Directives, will be given powers which are necessary to police the liberalised telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>The office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, which transferred to the new office the regulatory powers of the Minister in relation to the telecommunications sector.  The powers of the director have now been significantly expanded, in particular as a result of the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, 1998, which I recently signed.  These regulations empower the director to issue directions to telecommunications operators subject to appropriate safeguards to comply with the requirements of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Further powers of this kind will also be conferred on the director under regulations to transpose EU Directives relating to the licensing of telecommunications operators and the provision of leased lines which will be signed into effect in the coming weeks.  I am also looking at the question of bringing forward proposals for primary legislation to address a limited number of regulatory issues which are not covered by EU Directives.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent change in mobile phone mast regulations in both Australia and New Zealand; and the scientific evidence used for the basis of this change.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7482/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no recent changes in mobile phone mast regulations in either Australia or New Zealand.  Both the Australian and New Zealand standards for limiting public exposure to radio frequency emissions from mobile phone base stations transmitters are set at two watts per square metre.  Mobile phone masts operate many hundreds of times below this limit.</P>
      <P>Reference to new Australian regulations have their origins in a resolution adopted by the New South Wales Local Government Association at its annual meeting in October 1997.  Under the 1997 Australian Telecommunications Act, greater responsibility was placed with state and local governments concerning the planning and siting of telecommunications infrastructure.  The former immunity from state and local government laws enjoyed by the Australian national telephone company was substantially removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the around 1,000 local councils in Australia I am aware of eight which have sought to establish siting policies for mobile phone towers.  Five have recommended phone towers be sited at distances ranging from 100 metres to four kilometres away from homes.  The Australian Telecommunications <Col N="1421" /> Act requires phone companies to consider local policies but does not make them binding.  However, unless a local council provides consent no phone tower construction can proceed without appeal to a higher level body.</P>
    <P>The danger of a &lsquo;free for all&rsquo; situation developing in local council policies has led to the Australian Communications Authority, ACA, being given powers under the 1997 Telecommunications Act to mandate health standards for radiocommunications transmitters and receivers. One of the matters the ACA is now considering is the mandating of the Australian standard AS 2772.1. This is the standard which recommends the two watt per square metre exposure limit at mobile phone frequencies.</P>
    <P>Planning legislation in New Zealand is similar to that now in force in Australia and predates it by a number of years.  On 2 February 1995, Christchurch City Council attached its own conditions to the siting of a mobile phone tower. These conditions were more stringent than the national regulations applied in New Zealand generally and were appealed to the New Zealand Planning Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The tribunal held a hearing in November 1995 at which substantial scientific and medical evidence was presented and discussed.  In March 1996 the tribunal presented its report and gave permission for the development to proceed.  In its determinations, the tribunal set a condition that the strength of the radiofrequency field generated by the phone tower and measured at any dwelling house was not to exceed 0.02 watts per square metre.  This limit was set to reflect an exposure approximately twice the highest predicted actual exposure of the public to the phone tower on the basis of information provided by the phone company.</P>
    <P>I understand the health advisory authorities in both Australia and New Zealand continue to endorse the two watt per square metre exposure standard and, in recent information circulars, continue to discount any risk to health alleged to result from the operation of mobile phone towers.</P>

      <P>Air Corps helicopters regularly operate in the Castlebar area in the conduct of search and rescue and air ambulance missions.  On the date in question, an Air Corps Dauphin helicopter, based at Finner, County Donegal, was carrying out essential search and rescue training exercises in the north Mayo area.  The weather conditions during that afternoon were particularly poor, requiring the aircraft to operate at a relatively low level.  It is Air Corps practice, where low level flying is necessitated, that every effort is made by the crew to avoid causing upset to the public or livestock. The Air Corps was unaware that any such upset had occurred on the date in question.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the Air Corps is not the only helicopter operator in the State.  In order to confirm whether an Air Corps helicopter was involved, a positive identification of the aircract type and number-registration would be required.</P>

      <P>In preparation for the next round of Structural Funds for the period 2000-06, the European Commission has drafted proposals on support for various areas of rural development, including support for installation aid for young farmers, which would come into force in the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals provide for an increase in the maximum premium which could be payable from <Col N="1423" /> the existing level of 15,000 ECU, approximately £11,850, to 25,000 ECU, approximately £19,750.</P>
    <P>Ireland paid a rate of £5,600 to eligible applicants up to the suspension of the scheme in Ireland in August 1997 when all available funds were fully committed.</P>
    <P>Two independent evaluations of our scheme recommended that it should be either suspended altogether or better targeted at smaller farmers. A new more tightly focused scheme, on which discussions are currently ongoing with the various farming organisations, will be drawn up in 1998.</P>
    <P>As regards the new draft proposals, extensive negotiations with all member states will have to take place before they are finally approved and it is too early at this stage to anticipate the final outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 116, 118 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, all eligible animals are tested for brucellosis at least once a year by way of a blood test.  The results of these blood tests are interpreted by my Department's veterinary inspectors as follows: (i) positive; (ii) negative and (iii) inconclusive.  All positive cases are slaughtered.</P>
      <P>In general, any animal that gives an inconclusive result will be listed for further testing although the herdowner has the option of having an inconclusive animal slaughtered immediately. It should be noted that inconclusive brucellosis tests interpretations can be due to a number of factors, for example, mastitis or when an animal is drying off, and it is possible that, when retested, some animals will have a negative result.  When advising a herdowner of the best course of action to be taken in relation to brucellosis, factors such as herd history, and the level of brucellosis in a particular herd and the brucellosis situation in the locality would be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis reactors are subjected to ante mortem and post mortem examination by departmental veterinary inspectors at the slaughter plant. Brucellosis reactors do not present visual post mortem evidence of the disease.  Thus, in some instances further laboratory tests on lymph glands will be carried out to secure a definitive status of inconclusives or to eliminate brucellosis as being present in a particular animal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The person concerned submitted a ten month special beef premium application in respect of five animals on 25 February 1997.  This application has been fully processed for payment and the first instalment of 60 per cent amounting to £270.51 issued on 4 November 1997.  A further advance payment of 30 per cent amounting to £135.25 is due to issue in the next fortnight.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme or 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme. In effect the regulations require that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU special beef premium scheme are made a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes. Money is to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The person named did not apply for special beef premium under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>In order to comply with the regulation, the £171.72 &mdash; £19.08 x 9 &mdash; BSE compensation payment made on 7 October 1996 had to be recouped from his 1997 cattle headage payment of £683.00. The balance of £511.28 was paid on 10 October 1997.  Recouped money will be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The legal basis for the ewe premium scheme is set out in EU Council Regulations 3013/89, 1323/90, 3493/90 and 3508/92 and EU Commission Regulations 2385/91, 3567/92, 2887/92 and 2700/93.  The sanctions which apply in respect of applications are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A 1 per cent penalty is applied for each working day that an application is received after the closing date subject to the application being received within 25 days after the closing date. Applications received later than 25 days are rejected unless the applicant can show that, due to extenuating circumstances, he was unable to lodge the application on time. <Col N="1429" /> In the case of applications covering not more than 20 ewes, where fewer eligible ewes are found during checks than the number declared on an application form, or the quota, whichever is the lower, the premium payable on the eligible ewes shall be reduced by the percentage difference where the difference is not more than two ewes or twice the percentage difference where the difference is greater than two ewes but not more than four ewes.</P>
    <P>If the difference between the number of ewes declared or the quota, whichever is the lower, and the number of eligible ewes found during checks is greater than four, no premium shall be paid.</P>
    <P>In the case of applications covering more than 20 ewes, where fewer eligible ewes are found during checks than the number declared on an application form, or the quota, whichever is the lower, the premium payable on the eligible ewes shall be reduced by the percentage difference where the difference is not greater than 5 per cent of the number found eligible or the quota whichever is the lower, or by twice the percentage if the difference is more than 5 per cent but not more than 20 per cent of the number found eligible or the quota whichever is the lower.</P>
    <P>If the difference between the number of ewes declared or the quota, whichever is the lower, and the number of eligible ewes found during checks exceeds 20 per cent of the number found, no premium shall be paid.</P>
    <P>Applicants who are found to have made a false declaration in their applications or to any officer of the Department, (a) through serious negligence &mdash; will be excluded from the current year's scheme; or (b) intentionally &mdash; will be excluded from both the current year's scheme and that of the following year.</P>
    <P>The policy of my Department in relation to taking prosecutions under the ewe premium scheme is that, where the Department considers that an applicant has attempted deliberate fraud, the matter is referred to the gardaí for investigation.  No prosecutions have taken place under the ewe premium scheme in the years 1995 to 1997 inclusive.</P>
    <P>Details on the number of cases fined, disqualified or otherwise penalised under the 1995, 1996 and 1997 ewe premium schemes are set out in the following table:</P>

      <Quest>if special beef premium payments will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Wexford, including the BSE top-up payment, in view of the fact he was a bona fide winter fattener buying in fodder; and if the matter will be reviewed in view of the substantial loss that he endured.</Quest>

      <P>The person named applied for 1996 special beef premium on a total of 67 animals all of which were under 24 months of age and as such were each classified as 0.6 of a livestock unit.  As a result, the total number of livestock units reckonable for stocking density purposes in this case was 40.2, i.e. 67 × 0.6.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density of two livestock units per hectare applies.  This means that the person named could only receive payment in respect of 18.54 livestock units or an equivalent of 30.9 animals, on his 9.27 hectare holding.  Accordingly, he was paid a total of £2,786.25, 30.9 × £90.17, which was his full entitlement under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  The terms and conditions governing this scheme are prescribed under EU regulations and my Department has no option but to adhere to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU special beef premium scheme and 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards or downwards, later to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme <Col N="1441" /> and 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme.  In effect, the regulations required that when all the balancing payments under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme and 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme were made, a comparison was carried out between the number of animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes and eligible animals under 1995 schemes.  Money was recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped will be used to fund payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.  To date, the person named was paid BSE special beef premium top-up of £267.12, 14 × £19.08, on 7 October 1996, based on the 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  In 1996 he had 16.9 additional eligible male animals, 30.9 &mdash; 14, and will therefore be entitled to a further payment on the additional animals in this category. It is expected that these payments will commence in June.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the 1997 element of BSE compensation he was paid £310, 31 × £10, top-up on 31 male animals on 28 May 1997.  He was also paid £77.81, 31 × £2.51, on 31 male animals on 14 October 1997 under the 1997 EU agrimonetary compensation package.</P>
    <P>Under the 1997 national agrimonetary compensation scheme, the person named was paid a further top-up of £54, 27 × £2, on 30 December 1997 which was based on the number of animals qualifying for the 22 month instalment of 1996 special beef premium.</P>

      <P>The herdowner referred to by the Deputy has been visited by valuers of my Department on two occasions.  On the first occasion, the valuers offered £4,200 for four of the six animals involved; at the herdowner's request, two other cattle were not valued at that stage.  Subsequently, one of the four animals concerned died from suspected salmonella.  On the second visit, a sum of £5,000 was offered for five animals presented.  The herdowner has not so far accepted this valuation.</P>

    <P>Under the EU regulations governing the quota regime valid up to 1996, farmers holding suckler cow quotas were required to use at least 50 per cent of that quota in any one of two consecutive years otherwise the part not used in the second <Col N="1443" /> year would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
    <P>The person named did not apply for the suckler cow premium scheme in 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996.

Amending legislation would be required in order to exempt creches from rates.  I do not have any proposals to amend the existing legislative provisions to exempt creches.</P>

      <P>Employment-friendly policies were central to the budget and will remain so over the life of this Government.</P>
      <P>I am not averse to being creative in introducing measures aimed at helping the long-term unemployed as was borne out by my announcement in the budget of a new initiative in this area. However, I believe that allowing expenses incurred by the unemployed while seeking work to be tax deductible would be of little assistance because the vast majority of unemployed persons have either no taxable income or pay minimal amounts of tax from which they could offset expenses.  I believe that existing labour market policies which have been strengthened by the introduction of my new initiative to help the long-term unemployed in addition to other income tax measures announced in the budget represent sufficient incentivisation for unemployed people to take up work and consequently I have no plans to introduce the specific proposal referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>Relief from tax for disabled drivers is provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  It is a fundamental condition for relief that the applicant meets the qualifying medical criteria specified in the regulations and is in possession of a certificate to that effect issued by the local director of community care and medical officer of health.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not received an application or inquiry from the person referred to by the Deputy.  It would appear from the details supplied that the person may have been refused the required certificate on the basis that he does not meet the appropriate medical criteria.  There is provision in this event for an appeal to be made to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, 25 Clyde Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for relief under the regulations were drawn up following wide-ranging consultations with interested parties, including many groups representing the interests of disabled persons.  I have no plans to extend the scope of the relief at this time.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of all commercial property, including licensed premises, public houses, is net annual value, NAV, the rental value of the property.</P>
      <P>In determining the NAV, the valuer has available a number of valuation methodologies.  The courts have decided that the valuer is not required to use any particular method of valuation but may use the method most appropriate to the circumstances of the property.</P>
      <P>The most frequently used method for valuing retail premises is the direct comparative approach in which the values of similar properties are taken into account.  Licensed premises are also valued in this way.  Where there is a lack of direct comparative evidence, the profits, or receipts and expenditure, method is used.  This method is appropriate in the valuation of properties, like licensed premises, where volume of trade is central to the value of the premises.</P>
      <P>Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a rateable valuation or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

      <P>The terms of the career break scheme are outlined in a series of circulars and official instructions to personnel officers.  A copy of the relevant material has been sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There is no specific period of notice laid down centrally.  Individual Government Departments may, if they wish, make local arrangements in relation to the procedures to be followed when applying for a career break.  In general, it is in the interests of the person seeking the career break to give as much notice as possible to maximise his/her chances of being allowed to commence the career break on the date of his/her choosing. The minimum length of a career break is six months and the maximum permissible length is five years.</P>
      <P>On expiry of the career break, an officer will be assigned to the next fillable vacancy arising in his/her grade in his/her parent Department.  If there is no suitable vacancy, the parent Department should notify the Department of Finance so that the officer can be considered for assignment to another Department.  An officer is guaranteed re-employment in the Civil Service within 12 months of the expiry of the career break.</P>
      <P>An officer's annual leave allowance is reduced <i>pro rata</i> as appropriate in the leave year in which the career break commences and in the leave year in which the career break ceases, assuming the career break period spans two leave years and does not coincide exactly with the leave year. Annual leave is not granted to a person while on a career break.</P>
      <P>The career break scheme is currently under review by the Department of Finance in consultation with the relevant staff interests, in accordance with a Government decision.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax free allowances allocated to the taxpayer for the year 1997-98 are correct.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer and her spouse are jointly assessed for income tax purposes.  The taxpayer's spouse receives an invalidity pension from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  This pension is taxable but is paid in full without tax being deducted.  In order to collect the tax that is due it is necesary to reduce the taxpayer's tax free allowances by an amount equal to the invalidity pension paid to her spouse.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer pays tax under the marginal relief system as this is more beneficial, in her particular circumstances, than taxation under the normal PAYE system.  The benefit to the taxpayer from being taxed under the marginal relief system rather than the normal PAYE system is £170.76 in the current tax year.</P>

    <P>The contracts for such staff provide details of their respective annual leave allowances.  The annual leave allowance is subject to the usual conditions which apply to the Civil Service regarding the granting of annual leave and to the making of returns of annual leave taken, at such times as may be determined by the head of the Department.  The contracts do not specifically provide for the keeping of annual leave sheets. Payment in respect of untaken annual leave was calculated by reference to properly completed annual leave sheets being submitted to the Department's corporate services division immediately prior to the change of Government.</P>
    <P>The only individual who resigned prior to the change of Government in 1997 was Mr. Aidan O'Connor, who was serving as personal assistant to the then Minister of State.  Mr. O'Connor was entitled only to payment in respect of untaken annual leave days.  This amounted to 9.5 days in his case and a payment of £533.26 was made accordingly.</P>
    <P>None of those named above who received payments at the time of the change of Government in 1997 had received payments at the time of the previous change of Government in 1994.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  The dental health action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service.  A consultant-led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/handicap.</P>
      <P>Health boards which have a consultant-led orthodontic service commence immediate treatment on category A cases, the category of greatest severity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All health boards have waiting times for category <Col N="1456" /> B cases but these waiting times have improved significantly under the consultant-led service.  Health boards have been requested to provide information regarding waiting times for treatment of patients in categories A and B. When this information is analysed target waiting times will be agreed with each health board and included in their service plans for 1999.  A target waiting period of not more than 24 months may be a reasonable objective for most health boards. I will continue to develop the health board orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan accordingly as the necessary additional resources become available.</P>

The contract offers major benefits to consultants, including, in many cases, pay increases of up to 22 per cent.

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services, including the development of day services, residential and respite care services for people with a physical and sensory disability.</P>
      <P>An additional £8.4 million has been provided for these services in 1998.  Of this £2.4 million is for the elimination of underfunding of existing services, £3 million is for capital projects and £3 million is for the development of services.  Priorities for the allocation of the £3 million development funding will be decided by the health boards following consultation with the local co-ordinating committees.  The provision of additional respite and residential places will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>A sum of £16 million additional revenue and capital funding was made available in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap to continue the process of delivering on the Government's commitment to provide additional services in line with the needs outlined in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, and to strengthen existing services.  A sum of £5.25 million capital funding has been provided as part of a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are being agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>As not all health board regions have submitted their plans for service developments for people with disabilities to my Department in respect of 1998 I am not in a position at present to indicate the number of places which will be made available this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to estimate the full medical costs of treating smoking-related illnesses in Ireland.  Many of the costs overlap with treatments for other illnesses and there are substantial indirect costs to the State from smoking which cannot easily be quantified.  Tentative estimates of the hospital costs of medical treatment for smoking-related illness indicate a figure of approximately £80 million to £100 million per annum in current terms.  This excludes any non-hospital costs and indirect costs arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department supports the work of other agencies in a series of initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence, and therefore the medical treatment <Col N="1462" /> costs, of smoking in the population.  These include the development of anti-smoking centred policies and programmes by health boards and the provision of smoking clinics by general practitioners.  The Department also works closely with the Irish Cancer Society and other agencies in programmes to help people stop smoking.</P>
    <P>The health strategy Shaping a Healthier Future sets a target of reducing the percentage of those who smoke by at least one percentage point a year so that more than 80 per cent of the population aged fifteen years and over are non-smokers by the year 2000.  The strategy indicated that this target could be achieved by: extending the environmental controls over tobacco; reducing the allowable budgets for advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship by tobacco manufacturers and distributors; launching a voluntary code on smoking in the workplace; and continued action by doctors and other health professionals to encourage a decrease in smoking.</P>
    <P>Regulations were introduced in 1996 which prohibited or further restricted smoking in various public areas and facilities and an EU-wide ban on the advertising of tobacco products was agreed by the EU Council of Health Ministers in December 1997.</P>
    <P>I am committed to pursuing policies which reduce the level of smoking in Ireland.  Achieving the target set out in the health strategy would help reduce the expenditure required each year on tobacco-related illness.</P>

      <P>The number of people with a mental handicap in the Eastern Health Board area currently in residential care is 2,622 and there are 4,821 in receipt of day services.  The numbers who have been assessed as requiring residential and day care services in the period up to 2001 are as follows: residential care, 414 and day care, 529.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to provide accurate information on the number of respite places available in the region for the earlier years requested by the Deputy as, while almost all mental handicap agencies provide this service, the number of actual places available at any given time may vary due to the need to cater for emergency or crisis cases.  However, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that over 770 persons with a mental <Col N="1464" /> handicap availed of respite care in 1997.  Since 1991, around 200 additional respite places have been provided throughout the region.  A programme of new building is essential for the delivery of the services, including respite care services, which are required to meet the needs of persons with a mental handicap.  I have, therefore, established a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services to run over four years in tandem with An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, beginning this year with a capital allocation of £5.25 million.  The details of this capital programme are currently being discussed with the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies.</P>

      <P>Health boards currently maintain lists of suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines. Their purpose is to monitor and follow-up on reported cases of children at risk and to provide data for research and planning.  When families with children who are considered to be at risk change residence and move to another health board area, the information on the list is passed on to the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The report of the Kilkenny incest investigation acknowledged current practice in this regard and recommended the standardisation of child abuse registers and the introduction of certain safeguards into the system.  I have recently established a working group to review the child abuse guidelines and an examination of the current system of child abuse registers will be undertaken in the light of issues that arise in that review.</P>

      <P>Section 61 of the Health Act, 1970 enables health boards to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide services such as home help.  Eligibility for home help services is based on an assessment of needs. However, the above legislation provides that the service may be provided with or without a charge, at the health board's discretion.  Many of the boards have introduced nominal charges on a sliding scale based on the recipient's income.</P>

    <P>A regional collaborative multidisciplinary committee was established in the Southern Health Board in 1997 to review regional epidemiology and oversee strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease.  The board also advises me that extra prominence has been given to tuberculosis in both undergraduate and post-graduate education, especially in relation to multi-drug resistant disease and disease in the immunocompromised host.  Patients in whom a diagnosis of TB has been made are treated intensively and monitored closely during the period of treatment to ensure compliance.  Advice is given to patients, their families and contacts on aspects of the disease, including how it presents, how it is transmitted and how it can be prevented.  Educational leaflets on preventive treatment of tuberculosis have been prepared by the Southern Health Board, in <Col N="1468" /> addition to an information leaflet on the hazards of unpasteurised milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  It should be noted that since annual financial statements for 1997 are not yet available for the hospitals in question, the table presents comparative estimates of daily in-patient costs for 1996 and 1997 based solely on the overall financial allocation divided by the total bed days used for each hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> My Department operates a detailed mechanism for attributing costs to the different elements of a hospital's activity by means of specialty costing which enables a more reliable estimate to be made of the daily cost per inpatient.  This methodology allows the exclusion of both costs and activity related to outpatient services, long-stay cases, day cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry.</P>
    <P>The specialty costing system operates in thirty of the largest hospitals in the country.  Mallow General Hospital is not currently one of the hospitals submitting specialty costs.  For the other three hospitals the daily costs per inpatient for 1996 based on specialty costings were Cork University Hospital, £248; Mercy Hospital, £197; and South Infirmary/Victoria, £162.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 to 258, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Data on mortality, including infant deaths, are collected through the death registration system and compiled by the Central Statistics Office. Information is classified down to county level for the purposes of statistical analysis.  Since water supplies may be fluoridated in some parts of a county while unfluoridated in others, it is not possible to directly link CSO mortality files with fluoridation.</P>
      <P>With respect to morbidity statistics, such as may relate to Down's syndrome or osteoporosis, comprehensive national data are not generally available with the exception of certain notifiable diseases and cancer.  The incidence of Down's syndrome in the eastern region and in Galway is captured by the EUROCAT system, that is the European Concerned Action Programme on the Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.  Information on hospitalisation due to osteoporosis is collected in HIPE, the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry.</P>
      <P>For both morbidity and morality, however, investigating any possible correlation or casual connection with fluoridation would require extensive in-depth research down to the level of individual records.</P>

      <P>The last comparative study of oral health in 23 countries in Europe was published in 1996.  The dmft score &mdash; dmft stands for decayed, missing and filled teeth &mdash; for five to seven year old children ranged from 0.9, the best score in the Irish Republic, to 5.4, the worst, in Poland.  The following European countries use systemic fluoridation; Irish Republic, United Kingdom, Spain, France, Switzerland.  A number of northern European countries discontinued water fluoridation for socio-political reasons including the fact that there was an oversupply and unemployment among dentists.</P>

      <P>I am aware there are various projects under way in other European countries which are investigating the effectiveness of prescribing heroin in the treatment of heroin misuse.  However, from the reports received regarding these projects and based on the clinical judgment of Irish experts working in the area of drug misuse I have no plans to introduce such a policy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In February this year I announced the publication of the report of the methadone treatment services review group, which states that methadone treatment, as part of a comprehensive programme of care, continues to be the valid treatment for opiate dependent persons.  My Department's officials are part of an implementation committee comprised of representatives from the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Eastern Health Board.  This group will drive the implementation of the report's recommendations and will ensure that appropriate treatment and care is available to opiate dependent people and that the methadone protocol scheme is closely monitored and evaluated.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 241 of 20 February 1998.  As a referendum to amend the Constitution must be held in order to enable the State to ratify the treaty, it would be premature for me to refer specifically to its implementation.  However, sustainable development is also a national objective, and will be pursued as such.</P>

      <P>Qualification of urban renewal areas for tax incentives under the new urban renewal scheme which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998 will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  Guidelines for the new scheme set out the criteria to be used by local authorities in the selection of areas for such integrated area plans and provide guidance on the content of these plans.  A copy of these guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The guidelines make it clear that local authorities are expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage in selecting areas for the preparation of integrated area plans.</P>
      <P>Under the new scheme an area will only qualify for incentives if it lies within an urban area for which the relevant local authority prepares such a plan.  It will be a matter for the relevant local authority to demonstrate how any town for which a plan is prepared meets the criteria for the new scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Licensing of <Col N="1488" /> Drivers) Regulations, 1989, eligibility for a driving licence for persons suffering from diabetes is subject to certification of fitness to drive by a registered medical practitioner.  Fitness to drive may be certified for a limited period only so as to ensure that the applicant remains under medical supervision.  Fitness may not be certified where the applicant is affected by ocular, nervous or cardiovascular complications or uncompensated acidosis.</P>
      <P>In the case of the higher categories of vehicles, i.e. those exceeding 3½ metric tonnes design gross weight, buses and minibuses, fitness to drive may not be certified if the applicant needs insulin treatment.</P>
      <P>The restrictions on driving for persons with diabetes are currently being reviewed in the context of the making of amending regulations to meet outstanding requirements of the second EU directive on driving licences and having regard to advances made in the treatment of diabetes in recent years.  These amending regulations will be made later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>Planning law provides that decisions to grant or to refuse planning permission are made by the relevant planning authority and by An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal.  In making its decision on a planning application, a planning authority must take into consideration the proper planning and development of the area in question, the development plan, and any submissions or observations made on the application for permission.  In the exercise of their planning functions the authority and An Bord Pleanála must also have regard to any directives in relation to planning and development issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1982.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) General Policy Directive, 1982 sets out considerations which should guide planning authorities in connection with the consideration of applications for planning permission for the establishment of retail shopping development which would represent a large scale addition to existing retail shopping capacity in a locality.  The directive provides that consideration should be given to: the adequacy of existing retail shopping outlets; the size and location of existing retail shopping outlets; the quality and convenience of existing retail shopping outlets; the effect on existing communities, including in particular the effect on established retail shopping outlets and on employment; the needs of elderly, infirm or disabled persons and of other persons who may be dependent on the availability of local retail shopping outlets, and the need to counter urban decline and to promote urban renewal and to promote the utilisation of unused infrastructure facilities in urban areas.</P>
      <P>As this directive appears to address the main areas of concern which can arise in relation to proposals for large scale retail shopping developments, there are no proposals, at present, for further action by my Department in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware that shopping malls have been a major urban planning issue in the United States for many years but has been unable <Col N="1491" /> to identify the &ldquo;main street programmes&rdquo; referred to in the question.</P>

In the case of other tenant purchased houses, the three councils require tenant purchasers to arrange their own structural insurance.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 297 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998 (S.  I. No. 47 of 1998) were made principally to amplify and clarify elements of the specification earlier established for wheelchair accessible taxis by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 193 of 1997).</P>
      <P>The new specification makes more explicit provision regarding access to vehicles and restraint systems for wheelchairs and their occupants.  It also makes clear that a space for wheelchair users must be reserved in a taxi when it is standing or plying for hire.</P>
      <P>The height specification for door and interior of vehicles was also modified to ensure the availability for wheelchair users and taxi service providers of a reasonable range of vehicles suitable for use as wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is one of a small number of EU member <Col N="1496" /> states to have developed a formal specification for wheelchair accessible taxis.  This has been done by my Department to support the bringing into service of a fleet of taxis which the disabled community will be able to use conveniently and safely.  While I am satisfied that the new specification is of a high standard, it will of course remain open to further improvement and refinement.  My Department will work with all interested parties towards this end.</P>

      <P>Planning law provides that decisions to grant or to refuse planning permission are made by the relevant planning authority and by An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal.  In making its decision on a planning application, a planning authority must take into consideration the proper planning and development of the area, the development plan, and any submissions or observations made on the application for permission.  Local authorities have a duty under the Local Government Act, 1991, in the performance of their functions, to have regard to policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister.  The 1976 Planning Act requires An Bord Pleanála to keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of the Minister and any public authority whose functions may have a bearing on the proper planning and development of areas.</P>
      <P>My Department published guidelines on wind farm development for planning authorities in September 1996.  The guidelines identify relevant planning and land use issues which planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála should have regard to in considering an application for planning permission or an appeal for a wind farm.  They also provide guidance on how wind energy should be dealt with in the preparation of development plans.</P>
      <P>Work is under way in my Department on the preparation of planning guidelines on high amenity landscapes and the need for further guidance on the visual impact of wind farms will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to disability allowance is that a person, by reason of a specified disability, is substantially handicapped in undertaking suitable employment having regard to the person's age, experience and qualifications.

      <P>Provision is also being made in the Bill for increases in the rate of child benefit of £1.50 per month for the first two children and £3 per month for all subsequent children, to bring the monthly rates to £31.50 and £42 respectively.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether an anomaly exists when a pensioner, whose wife gains in excess of £60 to £90 per week, is disallowed an adult dependant allowance at £91 per week but, if that pensioner has substantial funds himself, he continues to receive an adult dependant allowance in respect of his wife even though he does not require same.</Quest>

      <P>The entitlement to a qualified adult allowance to a pensioner is based on the dependency of the qualified adult to that pensioner while entitlement to the old age (contributory) or retirement pension itself is based on the individual's own social insurance record satisfying the minimum qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>For a person in receipt of a contributory social welfare pension to qualify for a qualified adult allowance in respect of his-her spouse, he-she must be wholly or mainly maintaining the spouse. A spouse is regarded as wholly or mainly maintained where his or her income is not greater than £60 per week.  In the case of savings, for example, this would allow for a person to have capital of up to £32,800 approximately and still be regarded for social welfare legislation purposes as a qualified adult.  Where, however, a spouse's income is greater than £60 per week, the qualified adult allowance is not payable.</P>
      <P>The tapering of the qualified adult allowance for dependant spouses with income of between £60 and £90 applies only to the following payments: disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, unemployability supplement, unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>Any income of the person in receipt of the contributory pension is not taken into account in determining whether the qualified adult allowance is payable &mdash; only the income of the spouse himself-herself is taken into account in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's previous Question No. 135 on 27 November 1997 concerned the position of a couple, unmarried and with three dependent children, who were in <Col N="1502" /> receipt of unemployment assistance.  There have been no changes in the interim to the social welfare system which would have the effect of making the couple financially worse off from April 1998.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is questioning the effects of the tax treatment of income earned if one of the couple concerned were to take up employment, as compared to the treatment of a married couple in similar circumstances.  Issues relating to the treatment of married and unmarried couples under the taxation system are the responsibility of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Sixty of these 264 claims are covered under section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997, which provides for payment of arrears up to 12 months for claims made on or after 1 January 1997.  These clients have received 12 months' back-payment and are now seeking full arrears from the time of their spouses' death.  The remaining 204 relate to late claims made prior to January 1997.</P>
      <P>Payment outside the statutory limits cannot be made except in very specific and exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional hardship, departmental error or where the person was so incapacitated that they were unable to make a claim within the maximum claim period.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made to review all the cases where the question of further arrears payments has been raised.  The Department will consider the particular circumstances of each of these cases and where additional evidence is required to verify the situation this information will be sought from the clients concerned before a decision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 313, 316 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies arise from the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment, CE, workers which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, and which was designed to enhance the PRSI status of CE workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension, treatment (dental and optical) benefits and occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>One of the consequences of the measure is that CE workers who return to the live register may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit as a result of having paid class A PRSI contributions.  In such cases, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The social welfare secondary benefits, which comprise the Christmas bonus, the free fuel allowance and butter vouchers, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit claimants do not, therefore, have an entitlement to these benefits. It should be noted that secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a CE scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or Jobstart, etc.</P>
      <P>It is important to note also that, as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former CE workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties faced by those CE workers who lose entitlement to secondary benefits on qualifying or requalifying for unemployment benefit.  However, the effect of the introduction of class A PRSI for CE workers was to place these workers on a par with other insured workers, in terms of both social insurance benefits and liabilities.  In those circumstances, the position is that any concessions made to the former CE workers would also have to be extended <Col N="1505" /> to other short-term social welfare recipients.  By way of illustrating the costs involved, the extension of the Christmas bonus alone to unemployment benefit claimants in 1997 would have amounted to some £4 million.  The Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that in view of the cost implications, consideration of any concession along these lines could be undertaken only in a budgetary context and in the light both of the available resources and of other competing priorities within the wider welfare system.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the operation of the community employment scheme lies with FÁS and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am given to understand, however, that there are no indications of any slackening in demand for places on the scheme.</P>

      <P>Up to 1997 the maximum period for which payment of pension could be backdated was six months.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1997, this was extended to 12 months for claims made after 1 January 1997.  Recent regulations also provide for a proportionate back-payment for more than 12 months in these cases.</P>
      <P>The elimination of any restriction on late claiming would have major financial implications and would reduce the resources available for other improvements.  I consider that the arrangements which now apply and which represent a considerable improvement on the previous situation, are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned, whose husband died in August 1977, first applied for a widow's contributory pension in August 1989. She was awarded payment from 3 March 1989, giving her the maximum six month period of backdating permitted under the legislation then in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Acts were amended in 1997 to provide backdating of payment for up to one year in respect of late claims made on or after 1 January 1997.  Regulations made recently under the 1997 Act also apply only to late claims made on or after that date.  Accordingly, the statutory six month back-dating position remains the same <Col N="1507" /> for the person concerned, as she applied for pension well before the operative date of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Payment outside of the statutory limits cannot be made except in very specific and exceptional circumstances, such as exceptional hardship, departmental error or where the person was so incapacitated that they were unable to make a claim within the maximum claim period.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has stated she made a pension application to her local social welfare office in 1977 but that her application was refused on the grounds she was self-employed.  There is no record in my Department of an application having been received from her prior to 1989.  In reply to recent representations made by the Deputy on her behalf, the person concerned has been asked to supply any evidence or additional supporting information she may have to support her case.  On receipt of any such information the Department will re-examine her back-dating claim.</P>

      <P>When determining a person's entitlement to a one-parent family payment the legislation specifies that all maintenance payments received by the family must be assessed as means.  However, verified rent or mortgage payments, up to a maximum of £75 a week, incurred by the client in respect of the family's principal residence can be disregarded in assessing means from maintenance payments.  This means disregard applies whether this family housing cost is paid directly by the client or by his or her separated spouse as part of a maintenance arrangement.</P>

      <P>The proposal by the Kilkenny Art Gallery to extend its operation in Kilkenny Castle has been on the agenda for a number of years and Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, has adopted an open minded approach on the issue, providing assistance and advice to the gallery including professional advice by the Office of Public Works architectural branch.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the priority at the moment is the final phase of restoration of Kilkenny Castle, viz. restoration and refurbishment of the parade wing and south tower for use as a multi-purpose facility for cultural and other events/activities.  Tenders for this project have been invited and the objective is to place a contract at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position, therefore, in relation to <Col N="1512" /> the proposed expansion of the Kilkenny Art Gallery is that, having regard to the overall development of Kilkenny Castle, it would be premature to consider the gallery proposal.  No commitment can be given in the circumstances to this proposal but my Department is willing to review the issue again when the restored parade wing and south tower has been fully operational for at least one year.  On the basis of that review, I would then be in a position to reach a decision on the proposal. With regard to the question of funding for the proposals of the Kilkenny Art Gallery Society, the onus will of course be on that society to raise the necessary funds in the event of agreement in principle being reached on its proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular list of the national monuments in State ownership and guardianship in County Kilkenny, which are managed by Dúchas, The Heritage Service of my Department. The national monuments district office in Kilkenny city is responsible for operations in all or part of the eight south-eastern counties, including County Kilkenny.  All national monuments sites in the region are inspected periodically by the Department's architectural, archaeological <Col N="1513" /> and district staff.  Ongoing maintenance and conservation works are carried out either as programmed, or required subject to the availability of appropriate resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to routine maintenance and conservation programmes, three major capital projects are being undertaken in County Kilkenny at present, under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  An allocation of £2,000,000 has been made under this programme to Kilkenny Castle, with an amount of £1,200,000 being provided for works in 1998.  Overall allocations of £300,000 and £200,000 have been made respectively for Dunmore Caves and Gowran Church.  The 1998 provisions are £150,000 for Dunmore and £75,000 for Gowran.</P>
      <P>At this juncture it is not possible to say what further funding will be applied to these or other projects.  Any issue of future funding, either through EU Structural Funds or from Exchequer provisions, must be considered in the context of the competing demands for conservation works at individual monuments sites, the merit of such works and the availability of funding and staffing resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the aims of the Government's equal opportunities strategy is to promote the integration of equal opportunities for women and men into all aspects of public policy.  The policy known as mainstreaming, is an important element of both the Partnership 2000 Agreement and the EU Fourth Medium Term Action Programme on equal opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to developing a strategy which enhances equality of opportunity and develops a framework to pursue the full integration of women, among other groups, into Irish Society using a number of mechanisms including legislation.  The Employment <Col N="1516" /> Equality Bill, 1997, recently passed all stages in the Seanad.  The Bill's Second Stage will be taken in the Dáil on Wednesday, 25 March 1998.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision which allows an employer to put in place positive action measures to promote equal opportunities, particularly those geared to removing existing inequalities which affect women's opportunities in access to employment, vocational training and promotion.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Fourth Action Programme, which was launched during Ireland's 1996 Presidency of the EU, is to progress equal opportunities for men and women by mobilising all of the participants involved, by promoting the reconciliation of work and family life and by promoting a greater degree of gender balance in decision making.  The programme seeks to achieve these objectives by supporting the exchange of experience and information between the various EU member states.</P>
    <P>Other non-legislative initiatives currently being undertaken by this Department in pursuit of the integration of equal opportunities into public policy include:- The Gender Equality Monitoring Committee, comprising Departmental representatives, social partners and women's organisations was established to oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Beijing Platform for Action; it is proposed to publish the third report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women later this year; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform monitors the position of women on State boards on an ongoing basis.  At end December 1997, according to the analysis, women constituted 28 per cent of total membership of State boards and 35 per cent of Ministerial-Government nominees; it is intended to continue the policy objective of gender balance on State boards, with a minimum target of 40 per cent of women and men in direct appointments; the Department participates in the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, which is responsible for monitoring follow-up to the Beijing Conference.  Each year the UN Commission on the Status of Women examines several of the critical areas of concern in the Platform for Action to assess progress and recommend priorities for accelerating implementation and an Expert Working Group on childcare, involving all the relevant interests and chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been established and is currently working on devising a national framework for the development of the childcare sector.</P>

      <P>Persons seeking entry to the State are subject to certain statutory provisions. Immigration officers at ports of entry acting in accordance with powers given to them under the Aliens Act, 1935, may refuse leave to land to non-nationals who do not satisfy the conditions set out in these provisions.  It is not possible, therefore, to give prior guarantees of entry to the State where the person is required to present themselves to an immigration officer to seek leave to land.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 to 353 inclusive.</P>
      <P>The information sought in the Deputy's questions is not readily available and the compilation of this information would involve the allocation of scarce staff resources.  However, I have been furnished with information in relation to court orders for possession of lands and premises lodged in sheriffs' offices for execution which is included in the following table.</P>
      <P>I should point out that not all orders granted by the courts are lodged with sheriffs for execution.  In addition, in many cases where orders are lodged with sheriffs for execution, the order is returned unexecuted following resolution of the matters at issue between the parties and, in addition, requests are received by the Sheriffs to defer execution of an order while discussions aimed at resolving matters between parties take place.</P>

However, the Garda authorities do authorise the transfer of explosives.  Eighty seven authorisations were issued in respect of the quarry referred to by the Deputy from January 1992 to date.  Details are set out in the following tabular <Col N="1524" /> statement. Conditions governing these authorisations are set out in European Communities (Placing on the Market and Supervision of Explosives for Civil Uses) Regulations, 1995, S.I. No. 115 of 1995 which gave effect to Council Directive 93/115/EEC on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that on the occasion of graduation ceremonies at the Garda college no parking facilities are available within the Garda College complex for guests of probationer gardaí who are graduating. This is made known to probationer gardaí well in advance of graduation day.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have further informed me that at the graduation ceremony referred to by the Deputy one Bus Éireann coach was allowed access to the college complex. This coach was on contract to An Garda Síochána to transport the Garda Band and its equipment.</P>

      <P>I assume the question arises in the context of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997 which is currently awaiting Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Section 4 creates a new offence relating to possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for a court to decide on the basis of the evidence before it whether, in accordance with the definition of the new offence contained in the Bill, &ldquo;at any time while the drug or drugs are in the person's possession the market value of the controlled drug or the aggregate of the market values of the controlled drugs, as the case may be, amounts to £10,000 or more&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Market value&rdquo; in relation to a controlled drug is defined as &ldquo;the price that drug could be expected to fetch on the market for the unlawful sale or supply of controlled drugs&rdquo;.  The section also provides that:</P>
      <P>If the court is satisfied that a member of the Garda Síochána or an officer of customs and excise has knowledge of the unlawful sale or supply of controlled drugs, that member or officer, as the case may be, shall be entitled in any proceedings for an offence under this section to be heard and to give evidence as to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available but to illustrate the extent of drug use among the prison population, the report entitled Mountjoy Prisoners; A Sociological and Criminological Profile which was published by my Department last June, states that, in the ten years since 1986, the proportion of the prison population that had used drugs other than cannabis more than doubled from 37 per cent to 77 per cent and the proportion that could be described as having a serious dependency on a hard drug also more than doubled from 31 per cent to 63 per cent.</P>

      <P>For obvious reasons it is not possible to quantify the total volume of illegal drugs being brought into the prison system.  I can say, however, that improved security and related measures have been successful in curbing the smuggling in and use of illegal substances.  This is reflected in the fact that there were in excess of 700 seizures of drugs in our prisons during both 1996 and 1997.</P>

      <P>The efficiency and effectiveness of the courts has been improved greatly in recent years as a result of the appointment of additional judges and staff; legislative provisions to streamline procedures; the development of case management systems by the Judiciary and the continuing programme of court accommodation refurbishment.</P>
      <P>Court delays have been significantly reduced in all courts and virtually eliminated in some venues.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service Bill, 1997, which is currently before the Dáil provides for the establishment of an independent Courts Service with financial and management autonomy.  The new service will provide a management structure for the courts capable of developing a court system capable of meeting the needs of modern society. Use of information technology which must form part of any modern court service is to be expanded and developed in the courts as part of the programme to expand the use of information technology in the criminal justice system as a whole.  An increased allocation of £2.5 million has been included in the courts vote for this purpose this year.</P>

      <P>Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 years to consume alcohol in any place other than a private residence in which that person is present either as of right or by permission and a person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £50.  The Garda Síochána have the power to confiscate alcohol which they find in the possession of such a young person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Public Order Act, 1994, it is an offence for any person, regardless of age, to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity.  The penalty on conviction is a fine of up <Col N="1533" /> to £100.  Section 8 of the Act empowers the Garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of section 4.  A person who is found guilty of failing to comply with such a direction is liable to a fine of up to £500 or imprisonment up to six months or to both.  In addition section 4 of the Act empowers the Garda to confiscate alcohol where it is suspected that an offence under that section has been committed or where it is suspected that other specified offences under the Act have been committed and the alcohol is relevant to those offences.  It will be appreciated also that the 1994 Act contains a number of provisions in relation to disorderly behaviour which arise irrespective of whether alcohol is involved.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have no proposals at present to increase the powers available to the Garda in this area but the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The procedures set out in the letter of 10 December 1997 were effective from that date.  There has been some delay in giving full effect to the procedures due to staff shortages.  However, with the resolution of industrial relations difficulties, additional staff have been appointed to the asylum division of my Department and following training by the UNHCR these staff are operating in accordance with the procedures in question.  Interviews for further staff &mdash; the temporary contractors &mdash; have commenced this week and persons appointed will, following appropriate training, operate in accordance with the administrative procedures.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Peter O'Malley is already operating as an appeals authority.  Additional persons will be appointed as such authorities as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The circumstances under which an application is ruled as manifestly unfounded are set out at point 14 of the letter of 10 December, a copy of which was forwarded to Deputies and also placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my contribution to the debate on the Asylum Seekers (Regularisation of Status) (No. 2) Bill, 1998, representatives of NGOs met with my officials in February and asked for an independent person, rather than a departmental official, to be appointed to deal with appeals against decisions that a case was manifestly unfounded.  They also asked that I look at the time period in which an appeal might be lodged against such a determination.  I decided to accede to their requests in order to ensure transparency and a letter to this effect issued to the UNHCR on 13 March.  I am arranging for a copy of the letter to be placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>On 8 September 1993, the Government designated Mr. Justice Declan Costello, Judge of the High Court for the purposes of section 8 of the Intereption of Postal Packets and Telecommunications (Messages) Act, 1993.  He continued in that role up to the date of his retirement as President of the High Court on 1 January 1998. The procedures for the appointment of a successor to Mr. Justice Costello are almost completed, and I expect that the Government will be asked to approve a nomination very shortly.</P>
      <P>During the period of his appoinment Mr. Justice Costello presented four reports to the Taoiseach in accordance with the provisions of section 8(2) of the Act.  These reports were dated 16 July 1994, 25 July 1995, 19 July 1996 and 14 July 1997 and were duly laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 5 August 1994, 25 August 1995, 31 July 1996 and 6 October 1997.  Each report was accompanied by a statement under section 8(7) of the Act certifying that no matter had been excluded from it under section 8(8) of the Act.  In the case of the four reports, the designated judge expressed himself satisfied that the provisions of the Act had been complied with.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 430 and 451 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the child in question is currently attending the pre-school facility attached to Stewarts special school, Palmerstown.  I have requested my Department's inspectorate to investigate the long-term educational needs of this child.  I assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to ensure that suitable educational provision is made available to the child as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.  In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support where necessary of remedial or resource teachers. Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools dedicated to children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional/behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 1995-96 my Department commenced a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism.  The Department has commenced a review of this pilot programme.  This review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>Following these developments my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has indicated that he will, as necessary, consult with me to ensure that the academic and training programmes of both dental schools in orthodontics and other disciplines adequately reflect current future needs of the public dental service under the health strategy and the dental health action plan.</P>

      <P>In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specificially states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  There are currently 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country, including the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As there are no teaching posts at present available to me for allocation to these schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitment to one teacher schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 and 394 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the funding of education centres, my Department makes grants available to recognised centres on an ongoing basis towards the cost of approved activities and towards local activities and running costs.  These grants are made available under the guidelines for education centres, which also state that centres are encouraged to generate some of their own income.  Many centres have traditionally done this through small fees for services provided and being involved in major sponsored project work. This system has operated for many years under successive Ministers.  I consider it to be a good approach and I intend to further encourage and develop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has traditionally been seen as important that education centres should have a clear sense of involvement and ownership of their local services and activities and I believe that this should continue, while at the same time the role of education centres in national in-service programmes will be further developed and expanded.  National <Col N="1542" /> programmes are fully funded directly by my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards legal status and the Education Bill, the Bill is aimed primarily at providing a statutory framework for the education system at first and second levels and adult and continuing education. The education centres do not fit into any of these categories.  In addition they are established under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science and their status and relationship with the Minister and the Department already have a sound legal basis.  I am at present considering a submission made on behalf of the education centres in the context of the enactment of the Education Bill.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has received a report from each local authority handling the higher education grants detailing, in particular, the number of grant applications received, the number where additional information had to be sought, the number of applications where approval was not issued in good time, the number of cases where payment was late, the average delay where payment was late and the average cost of processing an application; and the progress in 1998 and the time frame for conclusion of his review of the grant administration system.</Quest>

      <P>I have not received a report from each local authority setting out the information referred to by the Deputy.  My Department receives annual statistical returns from the local authorities which contain information such as the number of new awards and renewals, the cost, the categories of grant awarded and the institutions attended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the review of the grant administration system, the position is that a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has carried out a preliminary examination of options for the future administration of the student support schemes.  I received the preliminary report of this working group in December last and this report forms the basis for the current discussions I am engaged in with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community <Col N="1544" /> and Family Affairs, regarding a more detailed review which will involve the participation of interested parties.  I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.  At this stage, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the more detailed review.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the timeliness of payments, I have taken a number of measures in 1997 which I am confident will result in speeding up the payment of higher education grants by local authorities.  These measures include bringing the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities to a current year basis and making a payment to all local authorities in December 1997 to enable them to issue the second instalment of maintenance grants for the 1997-98 academic year to students before the end of 1997.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the current school year, the supply panel scheme was extended by the provisions of a further 30 teachers.  The scheme now operates in 17 locations throughout the country serving a large number of schools.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was served by the supply panel when it operated as a pilot scheme.  In the context of the development of the scheme, it was necessary to redress difficulties which had presented during the pilot phase.  Accordingly, a reduction in the number of supply teachers in some locations was deemed appropriate to ensure more efficient management of the scheme.  A consequence of this action was a reduction in the number of schools in these areas benefiting from the scheme.  I should stress that the reduction in supply teachers in some locations was accompanied by an increase in the number of teachers in other locations.</P>
      <P>The provision of some relief for teaching principals from teaching duties to concentrate on administrative matters is a subsidiary function of the supply panel scheme.  Clearly, this applies only in schools which are served by the supply panel scheme.  Since Carn national school is no longer served by the scheme, unfortunately, no elements of the scheme are now applicable to the school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405, 406, 408 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated to special schools and classes which cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources, including child care support, are deployed as effectively as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which she refers will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>Since 1995, an annual allocation of £150,000 has been provided to fund a pilot scheme of grant-aid for escorts on certain school transport services.  All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered in my Department.  It was decided that the pilot phase should focus on facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools and special classes for children with physical disability, and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing-impaired and visually-impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
      <P>The question of escorts for children with special needs travelling to special schools and classes was one of the issues considered by the school transport review committee.  The committee's report was received by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in September 1997.  The report was published on 21 January 1998 and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has invited views and submissions from interested parties.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the future development of the school transport system, including the question of escorts on special services, will have full regard to submissions received in response to the recommendations of the school transport review committee.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grants whereby a <i>per capita</i> grant is paid to the chief librarians of the local authorities in respect of the number of national school pupils enrolled in each local authority area.</P>
      <P>Local authority librarians select, purchase and deliver books to primary schools.  Primary schools in turn provide a lending and reference service to pupils.  In many cases the local authorities supplement the Department grant.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I will be making available an extra £0.5 million for the provision of primary school books in 1998, in addition to the existing provision for school and library books.  I am satisfied that this initiative, in addition to recent increases as set out in the following table, is an important step forward in improving the level of provision in this area and I assure the Deputy that I am committed to further improvements in the future.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the <i>per capita</i> rate and the overall allocation under this scheme in recent years:</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  Accordingly, there are no teaching posts available to me for allocation to one teacher schools in the current school year.</P>
      <P>As yet no decisions have been taken regarding staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1998-99 school year.  However, the Deputy can be assured that the needs of one teacher schools will be taken into account when decisions in this matter are being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions No. 421 and 422 together.</P>
      <P>I raised the possible effects of the proposed changes to tuition fee arrangements with Mr. David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, at a meeting in London in December 1997.  The Secretary of State assured me that it was not the UK Government's intention to deter Irish students from coming to the UK and the new fee arrangements were designed to allow students to contribute fairly to the costs of their higher education.  As the Deputy is aware, the proposals involve the introduction of an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, the continuation of fee tuition for students from lower income families and the replacement of maintenance grants with student loans.</P>
      <P>I understand that all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance towards this tuition fee from the UK authorities, subject to the same conditions as will be applied to UK students.  In this regard, it is likely that those students with reckonable incomes below £23,000 will be fully grant aided by the appropriate local education authority and will not have to pay any contribution towards the fee.  Students with reckonable incomes of between £23,000 and £35,000 will be partially grant aided and will, accordingly, only be liable for a portion of the full fee.  Students whose reckonable income exceeds £35,000 are unlikely to be grant aided and will be liable to pay the full £1,000 tuition fee.</P>
      <P>Full details of the arrangements, including the administrative arrangements, are expected to be available by April.  Officials of my Department are engaged in ongoing discussions with their counterparts from the Department of Education, Northern Ireland, in relation to the practicalities involved.  My officials are also considering the impact of the new arrangements on student flows between the various jurisdictions.  However, at this stage, it is too early to assess the impact of the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the recognition of academic qualifications, I aim to publish a suitable statutory underpinning for the development of a national qualifications framework within a number of months.  A key aim of the introduction of a new <Col N="1554" /> frame work will be to promote international recognition of awards and international mobility. By puting in place a national framework, it will be possible to link with other jurisdictions where qualifications frameworks have been developed or are developing.</P>
    <P>In the context of developing North-South and east-west links, I would consider that there is potential to develop a common approach to this issue and at my meeting with Mr. David Blunkett, MP, Secretary of State for Education and Employment, on 17 December, we agreed that there is scope for co-operation in this area.</P>

The centre is not aware of any adverse reports regarding the boy's behaviour while on home leave.  On one occasion, the boy was late in returning to the centre and his next scheduled home visit was cancelled as a consequence.  It is normal practice to suspend or cancel home leave programmes where the child's behaviour, either in the centre itself or while on home leave, falls below acceptable standards.</P>
      <P>Management of Oberstown Boys Centre has contacted the boy's local Garda station and is awaiting a report from the gardaí as to the boy's behaviour while on home leave.  The boy's home leave programme has been suspended pending receipt of the Garda report.</P>

I consider that the appropriate course to adopt is to regain possession of the property and to enter into a new agreement with an appropriate tenant for the letting of the property as a sport-leisure facility.

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with a specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to the needs of such children.  Such facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1 and attract special increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>All such facilities are established on the basis of professionally assessed need and in accordance with the criteria set out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee.  My Department is prepared to give favourable consideration to the development of further such facilities where the need has been properly established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, my Department allocated £24,971 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities to assist in the administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged <Col N="1557" /> areas.  My Department is at present considering a request for additional funding from the association.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible. I assure the Deputy that the needs of children with a specific learning disability will be fully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>: I léacht, faoin teideal &ldquo;An Ghaeilge agus an tOideachas Tríú Leibhéil&rdquo; a thug mé in Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, le déanaí, léirigh mé polasaí cinnte i leith áit na Gaeilge ag an tríú leibhéal.  Dúirt mé go bhfuil ról tábhachtach ag na hOllscoileanna agus institiúidí eile, na coláistí oideachais do bhunmhúinteoirí ach go háirithe, sa ghnó seo.</P>
      <P>Mar shampla, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh fáil ar chúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge ag daoine ón nGaeltacht, ag daoine a chuaigh chuig Gaelscoileanna agus ag daoine ar mian leo cúrsaí léinn a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Tá roinnt cúrsaí ar fáil trí Ghaeilge sna hinstitiúidí tríú leibhéil faoi láthair.  Ba bhreá liom go dtiocfaidh níos mó institiúidí chuig an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta nó chuig an Údarás um Ardoideachas le pleananna chun cúrsaí nua samhlaíocha a shocrú. Ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de, tuigim go bhfuil raon nascanna idir institiúidí tríú leibhéil agus an Ghaeltacht faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Freisin, tá curtha in iúl ag mo Roinnse don Údarás um Ardoideachas le déanaí go bhfuilim sásta soláthar speisialta de thart ar £0.5 milliún a dhéanamh i gciste airgid an Údaráis do 1998 ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tá gach dóchas agam go gcuirfidh an soláthar speisialta seo ar chumas na n-institiúidí tríú leibhéil beartais nua a chumadh agus a chur i gcrích a chuirfidh borradh breise faoin nGaeilge.  Faoi láthair, tá pleananna á réiteach ag an Údarás maidir le moltaí ó institiúidí a thagann faoina scáth chun les a bhaint as an soláthar airgid speisialta seo.</P>
      <P>Anois go bhfuil an polasaí nua seo léirithe agam, is gá deis a thabhairt do na hinstitiúidí é a chur i bhfeidhm agus leas a bhaint as na hacmhainní nua atá á gcur ar fáil dóibh.  Ba mhian liom go ndéanfaí cur i bhfeidhm an pholasaí a choimeád faoi bhreithniú ó thaobh éifeachta agus araile.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allo cation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  There are currently 103 one teacher primary schools, including Leenane national school, with ten or more pupils.</P>
      <P>Since there are at present no teaching posts available to me for allocation to these schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitment to one teacher schools.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the necessity for an educational psychological service to be available to all schools, including those in County Cavan, and for the ratio of school pupils to psychologists to allow for the provision of a satisfactory service. The current position is that the Department of Education and Science has one psychologist working in post-primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>However, I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of a national educational psychological service.  The work of the planning group is now well advanced and I expect its report to be available to me shortly.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, my Department, in co-operation with Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick, is making arrangements for the employment, on three-year contracts, of 15 educational psychologists in order to extend the service at primary school level.  The recruitment process has now been completed, and the 15 psychologists are beginning to take up their posts. The needs of children and of schools in County Cavan and in other areas will be borne in mind when the new psychologists are being deployed.</P>
