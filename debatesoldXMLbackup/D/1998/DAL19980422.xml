    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is anxious to deal with the difficulties in the housing market. That is why the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, requested some months ago a <Col N="1443" /> detailed report which would include full consultation with all elements of the industry.  That report will be circulated in the next few days.  If legislation is required, it will have to be brought forward.  I do not want to pre-empt the announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin &mdash; members of the public would be wrong to make financial decisions based on purely speculative articles.  This could prove costly.  In reply to Deputy Kenny &mdash; the issue to which he referred is on the Cabinet agenda and should be taken shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in light of the discussion we have had in which the Taoiseach indicated the Government has taken decisions on the matter, I wish to draw your attention, a Cheann Comhairle, to the fact that the Speaker of the House of Commons has had occasion to reprove the British Government for making announcements outside the House in regard to matters which are the business of the House.  Given that decisions have been taken, do you consider this is a matter that ought to be the subject of clear answers in the House rather than press conference announcements?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: As the Taoiseach is aware, there were reports last week of possible interference with the property and telephones of two RTE reporters, George Lee and Charlie Bird, who broke the NIB story.  Why is there no reference in the Government's pre-summer or long-term legislative programme to legislation to regulate the private security industry given that the report of the consultative group on the private security industry has been with the Government since December 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question previously. A detailed examination of the entire security industry is under way and legislation is being prepared.</P>

      <P>In recent weeks the Taoiseach gave a firm commitment that the Health (Amendment) Bill would be introduced before the summer recess.  I notice that it has slipped off the Government's legislative programme.

A fundamental change to the Constitution is being proposed by the Government and that change has the enthusiastic support of the Opposition.  Not only has the Opposition indicated that it will support the change in the House, it will also campaign vigorously for it in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unprecedented nature of this matter ought to be drawn attention to against the background, for example, of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was also something upon which my party had been working when previously in Government. The Anglo-Irish Agreement was not only opposed in this House but even in the United <Col N="1448" /> States by the then Opposition, now in Government.</P>
    <P>It can also be contrasted with the attitude of the then main Opposition party, now in Government, in regard to the divorce referendum.  While it did not oppose the measure, it took no useful part in the campaign to have it passed.  If the divorce referendum had not been passed it would not have been possible to achieve the sort of approach that has made the present Agreement possible.  I have no doubt that a defeat of the proposal to allow divorce in this country would have been seen by Northern unionists as confirming the sectarian nature of this State in a way that would have made it impossible for them to assent to the sort of arrangements to which they are now assenting.  I draw attention to the fact that when the divorce referendum was being campaigned for in the country, and very narrowly passed, the main party now in Government took no useful part in assisting the then Government in having it passed.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that it understood fully the need for it, that party took no position of value in terms of support for the then Government on divorce.  Without that having been passed &mdash; and it was very narrowly passed and only passed as a result of last minute interventions by myself and others &mdash; that would not have happened.</P>
    <P>However, on this occasion that is not the case. This constitutional change is being vigorously supported by the Opposition.  I am conscious that a price is paid by an Opposition for giving such support, even to the extent that in the major national newspapers one's contributions can be dropped from the copy when the debate is reported, simply because one is not opposing it. That conflict engendered concept of media reporting is unusual.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I wish to drawn attention to a number of issues in this Bill which need to be addressed.  The provisions in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as now drafted have to be read in conjunction with the existing provisions of the Constitution.  Article 2 of the Constitution will now state that &ldquo;every person born in the island of Ireland [shall have the right] to be part of the Irish nation&rdquo;.  The Article goes on to say that &ldquo;the Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity .&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Constitution as now drafted will include, within the Irish nation, people not living in this jurisdiction but who consider themselves part of the Irish nation by virtue of living on the island.  They will thereby be conferred with rights under Article 1 of the Constitution to have a choice in the form of Government of the State. How are they to exercise that choice?  Currently they have no votes in Dáil or Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> Article 3 of the Constitution as drafted at present allows no difficulty to be created in regard to that because it makes it clear that the jurisdiction of this parliament is confined to the territory of Saorstat Éireann.  However, as regards the new provisions for Article 3 there is an issue as to whether someone who is living on this island, but not in this State, could take an action under Article 1 of the Constitution for the right to a vote in Dáil and Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Article 16.1.1º states: &ldquo;Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is already the case and is accepted, but Article 16.1.2º states that &ldquo;all citizens . who have reached the age of 18 years who are not disqualified by law . shall have the right to vote at an election for Members of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  Given that it is now to be the entitlement and birthright of everybody born in the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation, does that not mean that every Irish person no matter where they are living in the world, who was born here, would be entitled to vote in a Dáil election, under Article 2 when read in conjunction with Articles 1 and 16?</P>
    <P>This will be a constitutional provision which, by its very nature, supersedes and overrides any provision of the law.  If we have legislation in the House which says, for instance, that the right to vote is confined to people living within the jurisdiction or who have lived within the jurisdiction within the last five years, I would have to ask whether that legislation would be constitutional. Is there not a possibility that under Articles 1 or 16 such a person, now that the new provision for Article 2 is in place, would be able to claim a vote?  Even somebody who is 60 or 70 years of age and who left this country when they were 3, and who has never paid taxes here or has no direct involvement with the running of the State, would be constitutionally entitled to a vote under the new Articles 1, 2 and 16.  That is not an insubstantial question which needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties there have been in the past with proposals for conferring votes on people living outside the jurisdiction.  The difficulties have been considerable.</P>
    <P>Another possibility also needs to be reflected upon.  It is that Members elected to the House of Commons at Westminster might present themselves at the doors of Dáil Éireann and claim that under Article 1 &mdash; which gives them and the people they represent the sovereign right to choose the form of Government of this State &mdash; they are entitled to a seat here, under the constitutional provisions as now drafted by the Government and presented to this House.</P>
    <P>I raise these substantial issues against a background whereby this draft amendment to the Constitution was only presented to the House for consideration yesterday.  I fully understand and <Col N="1450" /> accept the reasons for the speed involved but we also need to take time to reflect on these matters so that we can overcome them.  I appreciate that this issue may fall to be considered by the Committee on the Constitution which this House has established.</P>
    <P>That is of no value if the Constitution is already being changed.  If the Constitution is changed as a result of the referendum on 22 May to incorporate these provisions without any savers, then it does not matter what the committee on the Constitution decides should be the provision as regards votes for people in Northern Ireland or for those who left this country at the age of three.  The Constitution will have created a new right which will supersede any deliberations of that committee or any legislation the Dáil might pass consequent on the committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (iv) of Article 3 states that the State &ldquo;may exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law&rdquo;.  It might be argued that for us to grant a vote to people in Dáil elections who do not live in this jurisdiction could be construed as contrary to international law <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rights of the country which has jurisdiction in that area.  I am not sure that is necessarily the case because we are referring to &ldquo;generally recognised principles of international law&rdquo;.  The use of the words &ldquo;generally recognised&rdquo; in the Constitution, a document which should create certainty, seems to be inappropriate.  The use of such words, which infer subjective judgments that can change over time, seems to import a degree of uncertainty into the Constitution as to what exactly is the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the State.  It should not be left to international lawyers at seminars in Berne or the Hague to say what is generally recognised.  The Constitution requires certainty and there is no certainty in any provision which refers to something as being &ldquo;generally recognised&rdquo;.  Generally recognised by whom, by what means and in what definite sense?</P>
    <P>Citizens of the United States have a right to vote in US presidential elections.  That provision is in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law.  If that is the case, what claim could there be against an Irish person living in New York who was born here but emigrated at the age of three claiming a right to vote? What arrangements will we make for that and for taxing powers in particular?  The Constitution already makes a distinction in respect of the powers of the Seanad and the Dáil in terms of taxation. It makes it clear that taxation and financial provisions are a matter only for the Dáil.  Will that saver, which confines to the Dáil, which is popularly elected, the right to impose taxation, be diluted by the fact that people who are not liable to pay taxation in this jurisdiction because they do not live here will be able to claim under these constitutional provisions the right to a vote here and the right to a vote on the rate of taxation that applies here?  Has that matter been considered? <Col N="1451" /> Relying solely on reference to generally recognised principles of international law does not seem to be a sufficient defence against a legal claim.</P>
    <P>Other issues also need to be considered.  Let us consider the example of a Sinn Féin member who is elected to a constituency in west Belfast or mid-Ulster. They say they are part of the Irish nation but they do not want to take their seat in Westminster on principle.  Under Article 1 they are entitled to have a say in the governance of the nation so they state their wish to take their seat here.  They claim they will take the State to court if they are not allowed to do so.  What way would such a decision go in the courts?  The Government should have an answer to that, although I am not sure it will be convincing.  We need to know what we are doing before we do it. It is the right and obligation of the Opposition to tease out the meaning of these provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II of the amendment states that the State may consent to be bound by the British-Irish Agreement and to establish institutions under that Agreement to &ldquo;exercise the powers and functions thereby conferred on it in respect of all or any part of the island of Ireland notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution conferring a like power or function on any person or any organ of State appointed under or created or established by or under this Constitution&rdquo;.  The organs of the State include the Judiciary.  It seems this constitutional provision could allow the State to confer on an all-Ireland ministerial body powers that are not reviewable by the Irish courts in the sense that this is clearly a right to confer powers and functions &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution conferring a like power or function on any person or any organ of State&rdquo;, which could include the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Agreement, as it currently stands, states that the powers that should be conferred on an all-Ireland body are solely confined to executive functions and that they do not extend to judicial functions.  However, it is unclear what court would have jurisdiction in determining any issue affecting the conduct of its business by an all-Ireland institution created under the Agreement.  If a citizen felt they had been oppressed by an issue decided by this body or that it was not fulfilling its functions adequately and that an order for mandamus should be taken against it to require it to perform a particular function, to what court would the citizen go?  Would they go to the Irish or the British courts?  It is not clear that any particular court is given jurisdiction over this matter.  It is significant that the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;, which is referred to in several places in this constitutional amendment, is not defined.  This is of some relevance here.</P>
    <P>Two things need to be clarified in Part II.  The first is to which court someone would appeal.  If a company had two partners, for example, one of whom was living in Northern Ireland and the <Col N="1452" /> other in the Republic and they felt they were unfairly treated in an all-Ireland business venture they were undertaking by an all-Ireland body dealing with trade and commerce, would they go to the Irish courts which are working subject to a written Constitution or to the British courts which are not subject to a written Constitution? What would happen if they went to both courts and there was a conflict in the two judgments?  If they went to the Irish court, would its judgment be enforceable in Northern Ireland as regards the activities of the all-Ireland body in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>This matter needs to be clarified because this is not a theoretical issue but a practical one as the all-Ireland bodies will be exercising powers in terms of giving a grant to one person and denying it to someone else.  If a company in Dundalk, for example, was applying for a grant and it was in competition with a company somewhere else in the county, and one felt they were unfairly treated by the other in terms of business they were doing in Newry, would they go to court in Newry or Dundalk?  What would happen if the decisions of the two courts were in conflict?  This is not an academic matter but a very real one.</P>
    <P>Another matter in the provisions of the Agreement in regard to the Constitution relates to the way in which the changes in the Constitution shall be brought into effect.  The provision in the Agreement for a declaration which shall trigger changes in the Constitution is something that shall be made by the Government.  It states that if the Government declares that the State has become obliged, pursuant to the Agreement, to give effect to the amendment of this Constitution referred to therein then, notwithstanding Article 46 hereof, the Constitution shall be amended as follows.  That means that 15 members of the Government, whoever they may be at the time, can make a declaration and the Constitution will be changed consequent to earlier decisions.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to decide the State has become obliged, pursuant to the Agreement, to give effect to the amendment.  I presume that decision will be justiciable in the sense that any citizen who claims the Government is not obliged to make that order could go to court to prevent the Government making it.  Some citizen might consider that some very small part of the Agreement, which was not implemented for purely technical reasons by the Northern Ireland assembly or by the British Government could go to court, and claim the Government is not obliged to make that declaration and therefore it cannot do so.</P>
    <P>We all know the risks involved here.  People who would be unjustly suspicious of the Government of the day could claim it had put somebody up to bringing that action because it did not want to make the declaration.  We have seen how people have been suspicious of our courts in regard to the decisions they have made.  There is the possibility the Government in making this declaration could be open to challenge.  Equally, <Col N="1453" /> even though the Government had obtained a great deal under the Agreement, it could decide not to make the changes to the Constitution and could make the case it is not obliged to do so because something has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>I do not have an answer to this conundrum. This may be a necessary and inevitable difficulty, but there is an argument that it should not be only the Government that makes this declaration. A declaration of this nature should be sanctioned by the Dáil and Seanad.  The idea of the Government alone deciding it is satisfied the obligations have been met is more open to challenge on the grounds that it might be accused on acting on the basis of a balance of convenience rather than on a clear constitutional obligation.  Given that under other provisions of the Constitution the Government does all its business in private and its declarations are entirely confidential, there would be much more of a tendency to be suspicious that the Government, in any determination it makes as to whether it would or would not make the declaration, was acting for motives that were not the best.</P>
    <P>A good way to ensure that charge could not be advanced would be to provide that the Government may make such a declaration, but it would have to be approved by the Dáil and Seanad.  In that way there would be a degree of transparency because the Government, having decided to make the declaration, would have to come into the House and explain why it had been made. That explanation, the process of debate, and the ultimate decision by the Dáil and Seanad on it would create a degree of reassurance and support for the Government in whatever decision it took. That would assist the Government in dealing with any legal challenge that might be made.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the possibilities of what we might consider in this House to be mischievous legal challenges to anything that the Government may do in this matter.  I mean mischievous in the sense that challenges may be made by people who would consider only a very small part of the picture and would not take into account the broader considerations that a Government by its nature has to take into account.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to criticise the courts in this forum, but there have been occasions when some of us in this House might have considered the courts took an unduly narrow interpretation of the Constitution, interpreted it very literally in regard to one or two articles and did not take account of the broader considerations of State policy that a Government, mandated by the people indirectly through this House, has to take into account. Therefore, we should be wary of any matter of this nature.</P>
    <P>I raise these issues at this stage so that we can anticipate these difficulties as far as possible.  I am concerned about what this constitutional provision does and about the right of any person, born anywhere on this island who is living anywhere in the world at present, to vote in a Dáil <Col N="1454" /> election.  I am also concerned about the possibility that representatives of one, two or three constituencies in Northern Ireland might present themselves at the gate of Dáil Éireann and demand their seats.  What would that do in regard to the notion that perhaps we are into creeping repartition and the cantonisation of Northern Ireland where one constituency, for example, West Belfast, would be represented in the Dáil, but North Belfast and East Belfast would have their representatives sitting in Westminster?  How would that work?  Under British law I know it is impossible for somebody who is elected to the House of Commons to sit in another jurisdiction. Therefore, anybody who presents themselves here to sit in the Dáil and wins that right could not go to Westminster.  They and their constituents would be locked into the Dáil as their place of representation by virtue of that aspect of British law.  Under Irish law there is no similar difficulty. A Member of the Dáil could stand and be elected to the House of Commons, but the reverse does not apply.  This could create a problem.</P>
    <P>Given the last 25 years in Northern Ireland where we have seen that increasingly Catholics and Protestants, Nationalists and Unionists do not live on the same streets, go to the same schools, play on the same playing fields or even meet one another, we should be wary of cantonisation. In this Agreement we are trying to create an inclusive arrangement which brings everyone together.  I said yesterday that the Agreement should be the focus of loyalty.  It should be seen as an end in itself, not as a stepping stone. However, if we cantonise Northern Ireland on the basis of ultimate aspirations rather than on the basis of making the Agreement work, are we not running the risk that the Agreement could contain the seeds of its own undoing?  That is something of which we should be very wary, and that is one of the reasons I raised this here today and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I intended the last remark to be my final one and I appreciate the patience of other Members who are anxious to contribute.  I have already referred to the importance of the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to the North-South bodies. I would also like to ask about the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor General, for whom there is a separate provision under the Constitution. It seems to me it is arguable that the phrase in regard to the institution being conferred with certain functions, notwithstanding the like power or functions of any organ of the State, could exclude the Comptroller and Auditor General from going through the accounts of a North-South institution.  It ought to be clarified that the Comptroller and Auditor General has such a power and that arrangements will be made, in conjunction if necessary with his or her Northern equivalent, for that audit to be done on all the accounts for the whole island, not just on the accounts for one part of its work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> At present we seem to be creating an institution which is not situated within the checks and balances of the rest of the Constitution, in which there is established an independent Judiciary, audit function and so forth.  We are creating an institution which one might say is &ldquo;up there&rdquo;.  It is accountable to the Dáil and to the Northern Assembly but not accountable to the courts or to the Comptroller and Auditor General in any specific way.</P>
    <P>The Dáil can only function because it has the courts and the Comptroller and Auditor General doing other work.  Saying that there is accountability to the Dáil is not sufficient because our demand for accountability only works in the context of the work of other organs of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of detailed points.  First, as I did yesterday, I acknowledge the constructive attitude of the Opposition.  I note that Deputy Bruton did not necessarily direct his comments to me, but I took an active part in the divorce campaign.  I used all our advertising time and all our party political broadcasts with the strongest and best known people in our party to urge a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, particularly in the days preceding the poll.  I know there were people in all parties who were not directly involved.  However, I appreciate the constructive involvement of the Opposition throughout the debate on this particular issue.  I want to acknowledge that particularly in the case of Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>The question arising from Article 1, to which Deputy Bruton referred, is an important matter. Article 1 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government and to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 1 is in fact a general statement of the right of the nation to choose its form of Government. It does not refer of course to the right of the citizens to participate in the election of any particular Government; it is a general statement of the right to self-determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems far more plausible that the argument being put forward by Deputy Bruton as a cause for concern to him could be made by reference to Article 6.1, which states that all powers of government, including the legislative and executive powers, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State.  However, neither this provision nor Article 1 can be looked at in isolation.  Under the principle of harmonious interpretation of the Constitution, it is necessary to look at all the constitutional provisions as a whole.  When one looks at other constitutional provisions, the following would appear to be relevant.  Under Article 6.2, the powers of government referred to in Article 6.1 &ldquo;are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution&rdquo;<Col N="1456" /> and under Article 16.1.2º, the right to vote is conferred on all citizens &ldquo;without distinction of sex who have reached the age of eighteen years who are not disqualified by law and comply with the provisions of the law relating to the elections of members of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is specific provision in Article 16.1.3º prohibiting the enactment of any law &ldquo;placing any citizen under disability or incapacity for membership of Dáil Éireann on the ground of sex or disqualifying any citizen from voting at an election for members of Dáil Éireann on that ground&rdquo;, but there is no prohibition on disqualifying a citizen from voting on any other ground. In fact, the electoral laws provide as an essential qualification for voting a residence qualification within the State.  The constitutional scheme of election of the Dáil is based on the concept of geographical constituencies.  Article 16.2 provides that Dáil Éireann is to be composed of Members who represent constituencies determined by law, the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann is to be related to the population, and the ratio of Members to population in each constituency shall be the same throughout the country.  The references to population must be considered as references to the population of the State.  To devise geographical constituencies outside the State would be an extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction which would be contrary to both the existing and proposed revised formulation of Article 3 of the Constitution unless this were to be done with the consent of the other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The constitutional provisions relating to the size of constituencies refer to the population and not to the electorate or the number of citizens qualified to vote.  This would make it impossible, for example, to devise a special extraterritorial constituency because it would not be done by reference to the same criteria of the constituencies within the State.</P>
    <P>Although Article 2 is proposed to be amended to define the nation in terms of the people who live outside the State as well as people who live within it, it is already the case that the nation is not coterminous with the citizens who reside within the State.  While the nation is not defined in terms of people under the existing Constitution, it is clear that there are large numbers of people who live within the national territory but outside the area of jurisdiction of the State who are Irish nationals and, thereby, members of the nation, even though this right may derive from the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, rather than by virtue of any constitutional right.  To date, it has not been suggested that the fact that they are members of the nation entitles them to assert that either Articles 1 or 6 of the Constitution would give them a right to vote.</P>
    <P>I cannot of course say that the claim which Deputy Bruton is making could never be raised. However, having regard to the doctrine of harmonious interpretation of the Constitution, such a claim would be inconsistent with the provisions <Col N="1457" /> of Articles 3 and 16 of the Constitution, and for that reason would fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The harmonies are being changed by this provision.  I accept fully that one cannot take any Article of the Constitution in isolation and one must interpret them harmoniously, but we are introducing new matter into the Constitution which strengthens considerably membership of the nation by people who do not live in the jurisdiction.  While harmonious interpretation up to now might have allowed laws to be made under Article 16.3 in a particular sense, a new interpretation must now be made in light of the new Articles which are being inserted in the Constitution. The balance is being changed for very good reasons, which I support, but we need to know the implications of this in terms of what will be the new harmonious interpretation of the Constitution in light of the new matter that is being brought in.</P>

      <P>I will answer the questions raised and then I will take more questions.  To confer votes on citizens in Northern Ireland it would be necessary to amend Article 16, but that is not proposed.  On whether it is constitutional for the electoral laws to exclude non-residents, the answer is yes.  That is envisaged by Article 16.2 under the scheme of election through geographical constituencies.</P>
      <P>On the point about the Bill &mdash; I do not want to get into argument about this &mdash; the full text is contained in the multi-party Agreement.  There are time limitations and I appreciate the Opposition is complying with those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generally recognised principles of international law have always been in Article 29.3. <Col N="1458" /> The point about Sinn Féin members in mid-Ulster has been covered.  On the extra-territorial jurisdiction, a generally recognised formula is already used in Article 29.  The concept of generally recognised principles is one which may develop in the future in international law and in the Constitution.  Both are living organic things and it would be wrong to fossilise the State's ability to legislate without extra-territorial effect to the state of affairs at any time.</P>
    <P>In regard to Article 29.7.2, this proposal would enable the jurisdiction of courts to be ousted. That would be done only if an appropriate alternative dispute resolution mechanism was provided. Deputy Bruton raised a number of pertinent and practical questions about the jurisdiction of courts.  The legislation or further agreements establishing implementing bodies will have to address those issues.  It is not possible to give abstract answers in advance on whether it will be appropriate to set up such dispute resolution mechanisms without looking at the precise functions of each of the implementing bodies. The proposed paragraph is intended to confer the necessary flexibility to decide the issue appropriately.</P>
    <P>The court to which a person would appeal will fall to be regulated in any supplementary international agreement or legislation on any implementation body.  These matters will have to be dealt with by the Governments pursuant to paragraph 10 of strand two.  Article 29.7.2 envisages the possibility of setting up special arrangements for resolution of disputes and would provide constitutional cover for the operation of such arbitrational mechanisms despite the normal jurisdiction and powers of the courts here.</P>
    <P>On the Government declaration, that mechanism is intended to create a precise obligation triggered at a definite point.  The obligation arises under the Agreement in Article 4.3 immediately on its entry into force and does not intend to confer discretion on the Government.  If the Dáil had a role that would imply discretion.  It is important to make the obligation precise to reduce the scope for court challenge. One cannot rule out the possibility that someone will bring an action, one can only reduce the chances of success over time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked about the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The proposed Article 29.7.2 could be used to exclude the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This could be done, however, only in the context of an appropriate alternative.  This might involve a joint audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Northern Ireland Audit Office.  One would have to consider what is appropriate in the detailed legislation on any implementation bodies.  In discussions on the Agreement there was a general understanding that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Northern Ireland Audit Office would have a joint role.  I referred to that issue during Question Time some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>On the declaration, the obligation on the Government will be virtually automatic.  It is clear <Col N="1459" /> from the text of the British-Irish Agreement that there is an obligation to make the declaration. The requirements are set out in Article 4 of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming British legislation will remove the disqualification that created considerable difficulties for Seamus Mallon some years ago when he was a Member of the Seanad.  He had to leave because of the challenge that was then taken under British law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said the people are not defined in the Constitution.  According to the preamble, the Constitution was adopted by the people of Éire, the people of the Twenty-six Counties.  The only sensible interpretation of that is that the people are the citizens within the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a detailed account of the court position and the question raised by Deputy Bruton on how the legislation mechanism will work.  Those are important questions and I would like to put the full answers on the record.  Subsection (2) is an enabling section to allow the institutions established under the Agreement to function notwithstanding the existing provisions of the Constitution which confer similar functions and powers on existing organs of State.  This provision does not go as far as the corresponding constitutional provisions in regard to the European Union institutions, which effectively protected laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by membership of the European Union from constitutional questioning.</P>
    <P>In the case of the British-Irish Agreement, all that is proposed is that the provisions of the Constitution will confer a function on a particular organ of Government and cannot be used to prevent the institutions established under the Agreement from functioning.  It must be borne in mind that the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies will operate in both parts of the island.  We in the South will have to accept that those bodies will exercise functions which heretofore would have been reserved for institutions established under the Constitution.  In particular, an enabling mechanism is provided to ensure that if any dispute resolution mechanism is established in respect of any of these institutions, that mechanism may function notwithstanding the conferral of exclusive jurisdiction on the courts.</P>
    <P>It may be considered apt for some of the implementation bodies to ensure that there are appropriate arbitration mechanisms to resolve disputes without reference to the courts of the two jurisdictions in all circumstances.  It would be undesirable to have a situation where courts on either side of the Border might arrive at different conclusions in respect of a matter which was in dispute. In the context of certain types of dispute, it might be appropriate to provide that an arbitration body should apply the rules common to both jurisdictions.  Whether this mechanism will have to be used will depend on the detailed provisions <Col N="1460" /> in respect of the bodies involved. However, that matter will be dealt with at a later date.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a right of appeal to the courts against the decision of any arbitration body?

      <P>This issue represents a lacuna in the new constitutional arrangements being put in place.  It may not be possible to address it today but it must be addressed before the end of October.  We are putting in place new constitutional arrangements which will affect the entire island.  It is inevitable that there will be disputes about the jurisdictional basis of some of these bodies.  Individuals will raise issues &mdash; if not in the shortterm then in the medium term &mdash; which could result in litigation.  At present, that litigation could take place in this State, in Northern Ireland or in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense we are dealing with communal arrangements in this legislation.  When such arrangements were put in place in the context of the European Union, it was recognised that there was a need for a European court to provide for a juridical body which could make ultimate decisions on issues of dispute to avoid conflicting decisions in different jurisdictions.  The natural progression and logic of that development, in the <Col N="1461" /> context of the Agreement, is that a lacuna exists, namely, a common juridical body has not been put in place to serve as a dispute resolution mechanism to produce judgments on issues, which could be contentious in the legal sphere, arising from the new arrangements.  That issue must be addressed.  If we cannot address it today, the Government must be put on notice that it must be addressed in the coming months in the context of the further discussions which will take place before the end of October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's constructive point that we will have to deal with this issue before the end of October.  The purpose of the new Article 29.7.2º will be to ensure that the existing provisions of the Constitution do not form a barrier to development.  It may be helpful, in the context of preparations for the establishment of the implementation bodies before the end of October, to resolve the details of these issues.  I do not believe this runs contrary to the provisions of Article 29.7.2º.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the last major point raised by Deputy Bruton before allowing other Members to make their contributions.  The Deputy inquired about the declaration and I will now read the explanation provided in the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of that declaration.  Deputy Bruton's question goes to the heart of the matter and I do not anticipate a need for any other Member to raise this issue once I have replied to it:</P>
      <P>9.  Subsection 3º provides that if the Government declares that the State has become obliged, pursuant to the Agreement, to give effect to the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the insertion of the new section 8 into Article 29, those amendments will thereupon have effect.  The text of these proposed provisions is set out.</P>
      <P>10.  The State's obligation will arise, pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Agreement, immediately on entry into force of the Agreement.  At this point, the Government will be obliged to make the declaration referred to in the proposed new Article 29.7.3º. Because of Article 29.3 of the Constitution, that &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States&rdquo;, Ireland will be bound to make the necessary declaration.  One of the generally recognised principles of international law is that treaties must be obeyed.  Accordingly, this subsection does not leave any discretion to the Government, once the necessary requirements have been fulfilled.  The purpose of the subsection is to provide a mechanism whereby the necessary amendment can be made at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative to providing a mechanism of this sort would have been to make amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution immediately, taking it on trust that the other elements of the <Col N="1462" /> British-Irish Agreement would be put in place or alternatively to have held a second referendum to do this.  Neither of these options would have been appropriate.</P>
    <P>This procedure for the automatic insertion of an amendment into the Constitution is novel.  It is expressed to be &ldquo;notwithstanding Article 46&rdquo; of the Constitution, because otherwise it would be necessary to hold a second referendum under the provisions of that article.  In effect, what people are being asked to do is to approve a conditional amendment to the Constitution which will have effect only if certain conditions are met. However, these conditions are clearly ascertained and the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 will take place virtually automatically when the elements of the British-Irish Agreement are in place.</P>
    <P>Subsection 4º has been inserted because, once the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 take place, it would be undesirable for the new Articles 2 and 3 to appear in more than one place in the Constitution, namely, in Article 29 as well as Articles 2 and 3.  Accordingly, it is envisaged that once the amendments are made to Articles 2 and 3, subsection 3º of the new Article 29.7 need no longer appear in the text of the Constitution.  There is precedent for this in Articles 51 and 52 of the existing Constitution under which the &ldquo;Transitory Provisions&rdquo; of the Constitution are omitted from the published texts.</P>
    <P>In effect, the new subsections 3º, 4º and 5º of Article 29.7 are transitory provisions.  They form the scaffolding surrounding the new Articles 2 and 3 which can be demolished once the building has been completed or if, for some reason, it cannot be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the first point made by Deputy Bruton because while the Taoiseach has answered, the question of the possible voting rights of people who will, under Article 2, be defined as part of the Irish nation is a little unclear.  It has been clearly stated that what we are doing is transferring the definition from territorial terms to terms based on the people in the island.  That is a significant change which I warmly welcome but I am concerned that the Taoiseach appeared to present a contradiction in that he said the powers of Government were based on decisions of the people, not citizens.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to define precisely the term &ldquo;people&rdquo; because he said it would be &ldquo;up to the citizens&rdquo;, which seems to be a contradiction. What do we mean when we talk about people?  It appears to me, and I am sure to anybody reading the proposal in relation to Article 2, that &ldquo;the people&rdquo; is every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation.  That would be a legitimate presumption by those who would wish to view it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach must accept that this issue will be tested.  It took a long time for the principle of consent to be explored in the courts in relation to the McGimpsey case.  The Taoiseach referred to <Col N="1463" /> this principle of consent yesterday as being a long-standing one, not necessarily in legislation but in practice.  I dispute that.  It may have been an action arising from an acceptance that there had to be a principle of consent but it was not common currency until very recently that we would stand by the idea of the consent of Northern people.  It is a welcome change in the body politic that that principle is now recognised by all the main parties.  The McGimpsey case came as a shock to people because it showed there was an imperative in Articles 2 and 3 that was not generally presumed.  That has given us an impetus today to change Articles 2 and 3.  That interpretation was extremely significant.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach a simple question in relation to this matter.  What is the definition of &ldquo;the people&rdquo;?  That has implications in regard to the point Deputy Bruton raised about the possible expectations people might have in relation to testing this matter in court because they may believe these articles give them certain rights they want to realise.</P>
    <P>The additional point raised by Deputy Bruton, which is pertinent to this also, is in relation to a representative elected by people within the Northern state, for example, a Sinn Féin representative or a republican of some type.  Currently Sinn Féin Members of Parliament are not locked into Dáil Éireann, as Deputy Bruton has hypothesised, but they are locked out of Westminster because they refuse to take a vote of allegiance.  Does the Taoiseach not believe that because this matter was not addressed in the negotiations, it may create pressure from that quarter to have the right to sit in this House in the future?  This is a failure and I find it difficult to understand why this welcome fundamental constitutional change is being debated in this House while there is no fundamental constitutional change being asked of the British Government other than what is ring-fenced within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have a problem.  We must recognise that major decisions will continue to be made at Westminster for a large minority of people in Northern Ireland.  They will not just be made within Northern Ireland.  Devolution is an important element but ultimately decisions will be made at Westminster.  There is a block in that regard, not just in terms of the oath although the oath is significant in that it prevents people representing their electorate at Westminster.  There are other issues of a sectarian nature, particularly in regard to the House of Lords, but I do not want to go into that issue now.</P>
    <P>Constitutional questions arise in relation to Westminster that were not addressed in the negotiations. I am surprised they were not, particularly because Sinn Féin found itself with this difficulty. Many people, and not just Irish people, in Westminster do not agree with the oath of allegiance and believe it is archaic.  This matter should have been addressed because it will add <Col N="1464" /> to the pressure on people who want to represent their electorate but cannot in good conscience take this oath.  They see in the changes being pursued in this Bill that it may be possible for them to represent their people in a way that is appropriate to their republicanism.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to comment in relation to the issue of Westminster because there has been too much focus by the negotiators on the internal and cross-Border arrangements.  In a sense the Irish Government has let the British Government off the hook when it comes to the inevitable relationship the Nationalist minority in the North will have with the seat of Government at Westminster.  This is a failure in the negotiations that may come back to haunt us if, as Deputy Bruton said, there is a possibility of a test being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having studied the document on the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks, I am still rather confused as to its overall implications. It is a lengthy document with much technical language and it is my opinion, and I suspect the opinion of many others, that no matter how well one tries to comprehend its implications, many doubts and much confusion will remain in the minds of the voters.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Government decided to hold the referendum on the peace Agreement and the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty on the same day.  It is obvious from recent opinion polls that the great majority of people have little or no knowledge of what the Amsterdam Treaty entails.  Having the two referenda on the same day will surely add to further confusion in the minds of the voters.  I ask the Government to reconsider this bad decision even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>There are pros and cons in the proposed peace Agreement.  I welcome some of the points contained in it but I have strong reservations about others.  The Agreement seems to have built-in safeguards for Nationalists in the parallel consensus clause which it is proposed to include in the operation of the power-sharing executive, but on the other hand this parallel consensus extends to Unionists and one wonders how this assembly will work.  However, it is a slight progression from total Unionist domination of power.</P>
      <P>The North-South council will advance co-operation but only on what one could term the bread and butter issues &mdash; animal and plant health having been mentioned.  These are important issues but it seems that on constitutional issues this body will have no real executive powers.  The Unionists, through the assembly and their Ministers on this council, will have the power to block its development and veto any move towards an all-Ireland council with real teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposals to reform the RUC. The commission to be set up to consider reform of the RUC is to be welcomed if it leads eventually to a police force that has widespread community support, but I have my doubts that this <Col N="1465" /> commission will have real power to bring forward any worthwhile radical proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the release of political prisoners are certainly to be welcomed.  Were it not for the corrupt unjust system which has always prevailed in the Six Counties, these people would not have been in prison in the first place.  On the equality agenda, having read through this fairly long section, it seems that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears far too often.  It sounds like a &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; and is very short on real proposals for radical action on equality.</P>
    <P>However, it is on constitutional issues that I have my greatest fears and reservations about this Agreement.  I particularly dislike clause No. 1 in Annex A which states: &ldquo;It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom and shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for this purpose&rdquo;. This copperfastens the Unionist veto on Irish unity, especially when it is written into new British legislation at Westminster.  Does this mean that we are abandoning the Nationalist people of the Six Counties with no comeback, or will the proposed new Articles 2 and 3 compensate for this by referring to the entitlement and the birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation?</P>
    <P>People will argue about the definition of the word &ldquo;nation&rdquo;.  It refers to a &ldquo;unity of people&rdquo; and not &ldquo;people and territory&rdquo;.  A nation that cannot clearly define the limits of its territory is a poor reflection on its Government and on its people.  If we agree to amendments to Articles 2 and 3, what we are getting in return is the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and this is meaningless as the British will still remain in occupation of the Six Counties and the Act of Union of 1801 will remain intact.</P>
    <P>On the referendum, I strongly urge the Government to put the question of amending Articles 2 and 3 in a separate referendum, not as part of a package of proposals.  After all, Articles 2 and 3 were a fundamental part of our 1937 Constitution and amendments to them surely deserve a separate referendum.  I have received a huge influx of correspondence from people all over Ireland urging me to use whatever influence I may have to oppose amendments to Articles 2 and 3.  I sincerely thank all those people and many others who hold similar views.  As many in this House know, my family, through my late father Neil, my late brother Neil T., and now myself, have represented the people of Donegal for almost all of the years since the foundation of this State.  We have striven over the years to advance the cause of a united Ireland by peaceful means. My proposed solution to the resolution of the centuries-old strife between our peoples is that the British should make a declaration of intent to withdraw in the future &mdash; perhaps 20 years from now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain has never been requested to take this course of action and it is my considered opinion that all parties of a nationalist hue, North and South, should unite in encouraging Britain to make such a declaration.  There is little point in our small party alone calling for this course of action, but a united effort by all could yield the desired result.  Now more than ever, the vibrant economy which this State is experiencing should be a very positive incentive for the shrewd business-minded people of all denominations in the Six Counties to become involved in progressing this economic growth as we stand on the brink of entry into the fast lane of the new Euro currency, something they will not experience by clinging to a dying empire which finds it difficult to conform to new ideas in the new progressive Europe of the 21st century.  There is no doubt that the agricultural sector in the Six Counties is already identifying the opportunities to be gained by linkage to the strong economic base we now have.  Should Britain decide on a timed and phased withdrawal, I am convinced that a considerable amount of financial aid would be forthcoming from friendly nations of the world to support our new nation through its early stages.  This would also, for the first time, afford an opportunity for the Irish diaspora abroad to play a positive role financially, industrially and otherwise in promoting the development of this new nation.  I am confident this would lead to the building of a &ldquo;module&rdquo; where all the various sections of our people, North and South, could, for the first time, experience the enormous benefits of living and working together in prosperity, peace and harmony. I would even go so far as to invite our Northern Unionist brethren to seriously consider going down this road along with us and to help us to build a new and better Ireland as has been done in other lands where they settled, such as USA and Canada.  This does not mean they should abandon their heritage, culture and tradition, but rather that the combination of our two traditions and cultures would enhance our image as a united people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having carefully considered all the aspects of this proposed Agreement, I am still left in a great dilemma.  I see good points in it, and I have strong reservations on other parts, my chief reservations being on the proposed amendments to Articles 2 and 3.  Having weighed up the pros and cons, I consider that some slight advance has been made in the Nationalist cause and that perhaps this can be used as a basis for the eventual achievement of my party's goal of a united Ireland.  I do not see this Agreement as the ideal solution or in any way a final solution to our problems, but I am prepared to give it a chance while still pressing for what I believe will be the only final solution that will bring a lasting peace to our nation, that is, a declaration of intent by the British to withdraw from this island while, at the same time, <Col N="1467" /> recognising that Britain has, in the interim period, a major role to play in assisting us in bringing about reconciliation between our divided people and the reunification of our nation.</P>
    <P>As far as the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 are concerned, that the proposed amendments will not take effect until after all the other agreements reached in the all-party talks are put in place does allay to some extent the reservations I have on this matter.  In view of this and that we in this House are not taking a decision on the Agreement arrived at in the all-party talks on Good Friday last, but rather that the decision we will take today will be one which will allow the agreement to be put before the people in a referendum on 22 May to decide whether that Agreement should be adopted, rather than deny the electorate that opportunity, I have decided to vote for the proposal before the House.  By taking this course our organisation will have played its part in achieving the peace we have all longed for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with Deputy Blaney in supporting the Agreement, but I support it rather more enthusiastically.  I heartily endorse the Agreement, and perhaps my comments could be considered in that light.</P>
      <P>As somebody who has an interest in matters constitutional, I say that in dealing with a constitutional issue the ideal would be for the Government of the day to issue a White Paper, for there to be a period following the initiation of a Bill of not less than three months for debate, and thereafter what I would term an information period of at least 60 days for the public to consider the issue.  That would be the ideal when dealing with a major constitutional issue, far more so when dealing with an issue of the kind before the House.  What is happening is that we are having a debate in the Oireachtas lasting three days in all, between the Dáil and the Seanad and 30 days thereafter for an information campaign.  I understand the pressures and the other imperatives, but this is so far from the ideal, particularly on such an important issue, that I felt I should emphasise my unhappiness that we are being forced into this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the very serious, technical and complex issues raised by Deputy John Bruton on Committee Stage so far that we could effectively debate these issues not just for hours but for days to properly tease them out.  I do not intend to cover the ground which was covered by Deputy Bruton except in relation to the triggering mechanism. I listened to the Taoiseach's response, and I am not sure he covered the point Deputy Bruton made on the possibility of having the Dáil rather than the Government make the declaration. It is clear that the Government, because of the rules of Cabinet confidentiality which we debated not so long ago, is not a transparent body.  It conducts its business generally in secret, with the exception of the odd leak here and there. <Col N="1468" /> Given the rules of Cabinet confidentiality, there is a case for such a triggering mechanism to be fired, as it were, by the Dáil rather than by the Government.</P>
    <P>A couple of other issues concern me.  The Bill is necessary to give effect to the agreement between the Government and the British Government made in Belfast on 10 April.  Article 46.4 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.</P>
    <P>Has consideration been given to the implications of this provision?  We are dealing with a 35-page agreement and I wonder if it is proper to refer to it in this Bill.  Is this a breach of the letter and spirit of Article 46.4?  Are we debating a Bill which contains another proposal, contrary to Article 46.4?  Perhaps it is a somewhat legalistic issue but I do not want the House to pass a Bill which is contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are a number of proposals in the Bill. Article 46.5 of the Constitution provides that a Bill containing a proposal shall be dealt with in a certain manner, signed by the President and referred to the people.  The use of the words &ldquo;a proposal&rdquo; raises the issue of whether it is proper to have a single question put to the people.  Again this is a somewhat legalistic question but that is the job of lawyers and it is better to raise the issue here than have it raised subsequently in court.  A narrow definition of Article 46 might suggest that every proposal must be put separately to the people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government has considered these matters before deciding on the proposal it wishes to put to the people.  I would prefer a single question to be put.  I wish to see an extensive reform of the Constitution in the years ahead which might involve omnibus proposals and a series of technical and other amendments.  If we were restricted to having to put every issue as a separate proposal it would make that task very difficult. However, we are bound by the Constitution and Article 46.5 refers specifically to a proposal. I am not an expert in the Irish language but I understand the Irish text of the Article is even more specific in referring to the singular.  Article 47 of the Constitution lends further credence to the view that there should be a separate proposal put to the people on each issue.</P>
    <P>I raise these points in the hope that the Taoiseach is in a position to knock down these arguments. They need to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak on Second Stage so I take the opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on the successful conclusion of the Agreement and the associated agreement between the two Governments. I also congratulate Deputy Blaney on his contribution.  No part of the State has suffered more from partition than east Donegal so it was not an easy contribution for the Deputy to make <Col N="1469" /> in weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of the Agreement for his constituency and the country.  It is clear that Article 2 of the Constitution will continue to proclaim the existence of a 32 county nation.  It has been the historical experience since the partition of Ireland in 1920 that no human hand or legislation can obscure the historic province of Ulster from our consciousness. In discussions such as these it can be dangerous to lay too much emphasis on constitutional definitions rather than the actual experience of people.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I understand that the Government has taken advice on them from the Attorney General. I will be interested to hear the Taoiseach's reply. When the Constitution was enacted in 1937 it was enacted as a single document with a wide range of issues, topics and concerns addressed in it.</P>
      <P>The point was raised about how many issues could be comprehended in a single constitutional amendment.  When it was decided some time ago to amend the Constitution to provide for the dissolution of marriage various conditions were laid down as to when or how the Oireachtas could provide for the dissolution of marriage.  There was a question as to whether there should have been two separate plebiscites, one on the principle of whether the dissolution of marriage should be prevented and another on the conditions that should be attached to the dissolution of marriage.</P>
      <P>It seems that it is necessarily implied in any constitutional question that there are a number of issues involved.  In the context of this referendum all the issues relate to the Agreement and the relationship between the State and Northern Ireland.  Granted this is a broad question but it falls sufficiently within the constitutional amendment to describe all the issues as falling within the remit of one proposal.  However, I understand the Government has taken advice from the Attorney General on the matter and I will be interested to hear the Taoiseach's response on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to the position of the UK.  On the basis of the Multi-Party Agreement and the undertakings on equality, the question of whether an oath of allegiance should be taken by members of parliament from Northern Ireland at Westminster is one which will be examined. As a result of the Agreement it seems to me that the constitutional basis of Northern Ireland remaining in the UK is somewhat different from the other parts of the UK and that, therefore, a separate arrangement could be considered in that regard.  Not only is the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to be repealed but the new British legislation will take effect notwithstanding any other previous enactment.  The basis of the incorporation of Northern Ireland in the UK will become the new British legislation which rests the link on the freely given consent of the people of Northern Ireland, rather than on any historical event in the past.  This would seem to imply that it would be legitimate under the heading of <Col N="1470" /> equality to consider whether a separate oath would be required at Westminster for members from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed about the question of whether citizens from Northern Ireland would be entitled to vote here in a general election.  I cannot understand this point or the point about whether the changes in Articles 2 and 3 would mean that persons who had a mandate from an election in Northern Ireland could turn up at the Dáil and demand a seat.  The constitutional provisions on elections have been described by the Supreme Court as a complete code.  The code is clear in its provisions in stating, for example, in Article 16.4.1º that:</P>
    <P>Polling at every general election for Dáil Éireann shall as far as practicable take place on the same day throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As she raised the issue of &ldquo;the people&rdquo;, Deputy McManus may ask what &ldquo;the country&rdquo; might mean.  Incidentally, in relation to &ldquo;the people&rdquo;, Mr. de Valera said in this House in 1937 that what it was doing was going back to the people, or at least that section of them whom it was in a position to consult on the matter.  He was referring to those living in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The basis of parliamentary representation here is the population of the State as ascertained at the preceding census.  They are the only people with whom we are in a position to consult on the matter of parliamentary representation.  It is clear under Article 16 that the basis of our parliamentary representation is territorial, that Deputies represent constituencies and voters vote in the constituencies.</P>
    <P>In the context of extending voting rights to emigrants, a question arose about maintaining a link between the emigrant and a particular territorial constituency here, but I do not know how we could establish a parliament under our Constitution other than on the basis of constituencies. The machinery of the census, which is also referred to in the Constitution, operates only within the limits of the jurisdiction of the State. It does not operate in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is confusion between the concept of nationality and citizenship, on the one hand, and voting entitlements, on the other.  Under the 1956 Act we confer nationality and citizenship on a vast range of persons.  Irish nationality and citizenship is based on descent through two generations and on birth in any part of Ireland.  The theory of our nationality law is now being made the constitutional theory of Article 1 of the Constitution. That relates to our nationality law.  It does not, as I understand it, relate to voting entitlements.  It may cause certain difficulties regarding our existing statutes on nationality law. They may require revision on the coming into operation of the amended Articles 2 and 3.  The position of persons born on ships in transit through Irish waters, for example, is somewhat <Col N="1471" /> obscure and may have to be considered.  I do not believe there is any connection between voting entitlements and citizenship in the Constitution. The same argument applies to the issue of representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>This is a fair point for Deputy Bruton to raise because we are changing the theory of fundamental provisions of the Constitution which appear under the heading &ldquo;THE NATION&rdquo;, but the nation under those provisions is distinguished from the State.  Parliament and voting rights are matters which pertain to the State whereas the matters dealt with now under Articles 1 to 3 relate to the nation and the relationship of the State to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about making the coming into force of the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 at the end of the transitory period contingent on a vote in this or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The State has entered into international obligations here and the Government has to obtain advice as to when it is obliged to implement Articles 2 and 3 in municipal law as part of the Agreement.  To make that contingent on a vote in either or both Houses of the Oireachtas would introduce an element of uncertainty into the implementation procedure for the Agreement.  There have been a number of votes on the political plane in the past few weeks and there will be one or two more before the referendum takes place.  Nevertheless, on the plane with which we are involved today, the Government will have to make a decision in the light of its international obligations on when it is obliged under the Agreement to proceed with Articles 2 and 3.  Of course the Agreement would not come into force if the people decided not to approve the constitutional changes, but assuming they do a decision will have to be taken as to whether the various standards laid down in the Agreement regarding when we amend the Constitution have been met.  That is essentially a legal rather than a political question and, therefore, the Government &mdash; not the Oireachtas &mdash; which, under the Constitution, is charged with the external relations of the State, is in the best position, having taken advice, to arrive at a conclusion on that issue rather than leave it to the vagaries of political debate in one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I understand the spirit in which Deputy Bruton put forward this proposal, but it conflicts somewhat with the basic presumptions of our constitutional order.  In passing I want to tell Deputy Bruton that a conceivable objection to the Agreement was brought to my attention at a party cumann meeting a few nights ago.  I was told that if Deputy Bruton was in power making this decision it would be undesirable to leave the Constitution in that state.</P>

      <P>In other words, while they trust Deputy Ahern with the function of making this declaration, they might not trust Deputy Bruton if he reassumed the office of Taoiseach.  Whoever has to exercise this function must do so in accordance with an agreement which lays down standards to be observed.</P>
      <P>There was discussion earlier about the question of a court.  When the European Community was establish a court and a court of auditors was established.  The question of audit and judicial control was built into the founding treaties of the communities.  We have not done that in this arrangement.  It has been suggested that this creates a gap.  I am not sure it does.  In so far as the Agreement contains international provisions, the normal forms of dispute settlement in public international law apply to the Agreement.  If, for example, there was a breach of the Agreement on the part of the United Kingdom, Ireland could seek an international arbitration on that issue in accordance with the normal procedures of public international law.  What would happen if a person sues an implementation body in the Circuit Court in Tralee?  The legal effects the implementation bodies will have in different jurisdictions are a matter for the courts of the two jurisdictions.  In regard to arbitration, it is in rare circumstances the courts interfere with an arbitral award.  If the Governments decide the appropriate form of dispute settlement here is arbitration there would be limited circumstances in which the courts would set aside an arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of interest relates to the question of Article 29.7.2º and the question of whether the institutions being established under the Agreement can exercise their power in any part of the island of Ireland.  I wonder about the islands off the island of Ireland.  Is it envisaged the implementation bodies will not be involved there?  The article states that &ldquo; . notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution conferring a like power or function .&rdquo; they can exercise that function.  That stems from the fact that our Constitution assumes the only bodies entitled to exercise political authority on behalf of the people are the organs established by the Constitution.  When we acceded to European Community membership we empowered the Oireachtas to do that and we also gave complete constitutional cover to the operations of all these institutions, notwithstanding the fact that they were exercising powers also being exercised by this House, the Government and the courts.  This clause is different.  It merely states that the institutions can be set up and they are not unconstitutional because they may be exercising some of the powers of the Government, the Dáil or the courts if that is what the Agreement allows.  The clause does not go on to state, however, that the bodies will have complete constitutional protection. If any of them acted in breach of the fundamental rights provisions contained in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution, they would be answerable to our courts in respect of those fundamental <Col N="1473" /> rights in our jurisdiction.  That point is not addressed in this article.  In other words, the institutions established under the Agreement will not have the degree of constitutional protection European institutions have under our system and that is desirable.</P>

      <P>It is addressed in the text before the House.  It is clear in the text that the only point being made in that article is that powers and functions can be exercised by these bodies, but they are constitutional and not in derogation of the powers of the Oireachtas, the Government or the courts established by the Constitution.  If those powers are exercised they are subject to all other constitutional control. That is my interpretation of the matter.</P>

      <P>That includes the courts only in the context of the exclusivity of the judicial power conferred on them under the Constitution. It envisages the only courts permitted being the courts of Ireland.  When we joined the European Community we had to provide complete constitutional immunity to give jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  Likewise, where a court, arbitration body, or tribunal is established here under the Agreement this Article would provide constitutional cover for the existence of that institution but any decisions it made would have to be subject to the fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution in so far as their legal effect in the jurisdiction.  That is my interpretation and I am not speaking for the Government on this provision.  It is necessary and is required to provide constitutional cover.</P>

      <P>There was a query earlier as to whether the principle of the State having extra-territorial jurisdiction should be subject to the principles of international law.  That is a matter any self-respecting state must subject to the principles of public international law.  There are states which violate these principles and infringe the territorial sovereignty of other states.  They send raiding parties around the world to commit private assassinations in other jurisdictions, which is a breach of the principles.</P>
      <P>We are amending our Constitution and to avoid any confusion in Northern Ireland about the precise powers of the state it has been decided it would be more appropriate to relocate the provisions in regard to extraterritorial jurisdiction elsewhere in the Constitution.  They are contained in Article 3 currently and will be relocated in Article 29.  There is a certain logic in that and one must subject them to the principles of public international law that says to a state it can exercise jurisdiction anywhere in the world over its nationals, comprehensive jurisdiction in its territory and extraterritorial jurisdiction in certain limited instances.</P>
      <P>Were we to adopt Deputy Bruton's suggestion of not putting extraterritorial jurisdiction subject to international law, the opponents of the Agreement in Northern Ireland will be able to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton sees the difficulty I apprehend.  If we did not have that in the clause, it could easily be said in Northern Ireland this is a State which claims to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction on any basis whatsoever and that would include jurisdiction in Northern Ireland whereas by saying it is subject to the recognised principles of international law one is saying this State behaves as other civilised states do in respect of this matter.  That is important in terms of the presentation of the Agreement in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>It would be useful if the provisions in page 11, subsection (7) dealing with Supreme Court jurisdiction in examining the functions of a North-South body were to be preserved and it was made clear that the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision&rdquo; did not apply to the provisions of the Supreme Court having the right to interpret the rights of citizens.  It might be useful to incorporate in Article 7.1 a reference to the Supreme Court and in particular to Article 34.4.4º of the Constitution.  The wording would then read: &ldquo;that the institutions shall exercise their powers . notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution conferring a like power or function on any person or any organ of State appointed under or created or established by or under this Constitution save that the powers conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 34.4.4º shall continue to apply.&rdquo; That would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pursued the issue of whether people have an automatic right to demand a vote in a Dáil election under the new constitutional provision and the Taoiseach argued that they do not.  He said that an individual born here who has emigrated or one living in Northern Ireland does not have an automatic constitutional right to a vote in a Dáil election notwithstanding the fact that Article 1 of the Constitution states they have a sovereign right to choose their form of Government as members of the nation and Article 6 which gives them a right to designate their rulers, which could include the President. The Taoiseach said that other provisions in the Constitution allow the Government to deny <Col N="1476" /> them the right to vote.  He relies essentially on Article 16 which states a law may be passed by the Dáil effectively deciding who shall have the right to vote and confining that by law to this jurisdiction &mdash; the Twenty-six counties.</P>
    <P>Any law passed under Article 16 must comply with the Constitution as a whole and Articles 1 and 6 could be used as a basis for saying that a law that confines the right to vote to people in the Twenty-six counties is unconstitutional on the basis of a harmonious interpretation of all the articles in the Constitution.  Articles 1 and 6 supersede and invalidate any right placed in the Dáil to confine the right to vote to people living in the State.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the State is not defined in the Constitution and I refer the Taoiseach to the book &ldquo;The Irish Constitution&rdquo; which says the physical extent of the State in the sense of the areas to which its law is applied is not defined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In deciding the extent of Éire in the Constitution, the only reference is to the extent of the Saorstát or the Free State but even the Free State Constitution does not define the extent of the Free State.  The Free State was defined in the Government of Ireland Act which decided that the Twenty-six Counties would have one parliament and the Six Counties would have another. The Taoiseach or the Government in relying in any court on the right to deny somebody from Northern Ireland or somebody living in America the right to vote would be relying on a British Act of Parliament, the Government of Ireland Act.  <i>The Irish Constitution</i>&mdash; pages 14 and 15, states:</P>
    <P>The Constitution of 1922, however, contained no statement of the State's extent, so that the area of its jurisdiction has to be gathered elsewhere as follows: (1) The Government of Ireland Act 1920, provided for Parliaments for both Northern and Southern Ireland ..</P>
    <P>A provision of that Act limited jurisdiction to the parliamentary counties of the Six Counties.  It refers to the southern parliament that never functioned. The only other place where there is a legal instrument saying that the laws of the Saorstát only apply to Twenty-six Counties is in the Treaty (Confirmation of Amendment Agreement) Act, 1925, which is the boundary commission legislation. It stated that the extent of the State confirmed the existence of Northern Ireland for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 and shall be such as was fixed by subsection (2) of section one of that Act.  In other words the definition of the State is in the Government of Ireland Act.  We have a difficult situation here. We are saying that we are relying on a constitutional provision, Article 16, which allows the Dáil to make laws which provide that only people who live in this State should have a vote.  The definition of the extent of the State is nowhere contained in any legislation passed in this jurisdiction. The only place it is defined is in the Government of Ireland Act passed in Westminster, <Col N="1477" /> before the State came into being.  We are also saying that the counterpart for our proposed amendment to Articles 2 and 3 shall be an amendment by the British Parliament of that legislation which is the only statutory definition of the extent of our State, namely, the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>We are actually creating a situation where we are asking for something to be changed with one hand while saying that that very Act, the Government of Ireland Act, is the only basis on which we have the right to deny people a vote in an election on the basis of our law.  Our law is confined to the extent of the Saorstát and the Saorstát is determined and defined in its extent by the Government of Ireland Act.  There is a real difficulty here which the Taoiseach and the Government have not adequately addressed.  I refer them in particular to pages 14 and 15 of <i>The Irish Constitution.</i> It clearly indicates that nowhere in any of our constitutional law is the extent of the State defined and, therefore, the application of its laws and that we are relying for that geographical definition currently solely on the Government of Ireland Act, as referred to in <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by Kelly, Hogan and Whyte.  This is an anomalous situation which has its ironies.  One of the great demands was for an amendment to the Government of Ireland Act as a counterpart for changing Articles 2 and 3.  Yet we are relying on the Government of Ireland Act in another sense to say that people who live anywhere in the world do not necessarily have a vote.  What will happen if the Government of Ireland Act is changed in a way we do not like?  Will that change the way in which we can rely on Article 16?  This is an issue that needs more than superficial examination.</P>

      <P>I congratulate all those involved in the discussions which led to the Good Friday Agreement.  There are many politicians on all sides who have been involved over the years in this process.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and the other leaders down through the years such as Charles Haughey, who commenced the process, Albert Reynolds, who drove it forward very strongly and Deputies John Bruton and Spring. We must not forget the civil servants who did the nitty gritty work and who will never get the praise they deserve.  I thank them for the efforts, time and energy they have put into this process.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of going through the Agreement in detail as there are sufficient lawmen who will parse every word and sentence.  That is their area of expertise and I suppose it is necessary. From a layman's point of view my constituents view this Agreement as an enormous step forward from a practical point of view.  It is not the final step that many of us would wish for but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It acknowledges in principle that in Ireland, North and South, it is the people of the two areas who have the ownership of the territory on which <Col N="1478" /> we exist.  It has been acknowledged by the British that it is up to us to decide what we wish to do for the future.  This acknowledgement is an enormous step forward.</P>
    <P>The proposed institutions under Strand Two are practical aspects of how to put into operation the unity of this island.  If these institutions work satisfactorily they will push forward the unification of this country as we would wish it to be.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised by some people, for the sake of opposition, that the two questions on the Amsterdam Treaty and this Agreement should not be put on the same day because the people would not understand.  Every day I listen to people who say we have the most educated and informed nation in the world not to mention in Europe.  I believe that is so.  I have no doubt the people will understand what will be put before them, provided the information, especially on the Amsterdam Treaty, is provided.  I have every confidence in the people to understand what will be put before them and to come to the right decisions.  Will the Taoiseach explain the current standing of Article 2 in international law and what will be the standing of the amended Article 2 in international law?</P>

I join other Members in congratulating the Taoiseach and my constituency colleague and occasional rival, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on the very difficult task they undertook.  They deserve the congratulations of this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss some of the technical issues which are relevant in the context of what we are doing.  I also wish to highlight an issue which has not been mentioned, which requires constitutional change and which it is illogical not to deal with.</P>
      <P>I welcome the important changes we are making to Articles 2 and 3, which Fine Gael has advocated for many years.  It is a great tragedy that we did not move many years ago from the territorial imperative reflected in those articles.  We are now replacing that with a democratic imperative which acknowledges the diversity of origins, symbols, ethos and religious belief for the entire Irish nation.  That is an important acknowledgement as the article as originally framed was too narrow.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in dealing with queries, referred to the principles the courts have articulated of a harmonious interpretation of the Constitution. It is important this new ethos, which recognises diversity on this island, is reflected throughout the Constitution.  I appreciate that the timescale involved in the production of this legislation was extremely limited.  The focus has been on the Agreement which was put in place on Good Friday.  There was a lost opportunity in the context of the referendum to make one basic amendment to the Constitution which we should make in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the preamble to the Constitution and to what the constitutional review committee said about it.  It said the current preamble did not commend itself to most members of the review group who felt the language reflecting the ethos of the 1930s is overly Roman Catholic and Nationalist in tone, gender-biased and would be objectionable to many in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>In keeping with what we are now doing with Articles 2 and 3, we should also amend the preamble. The review group suggested a number of approaches which could be adopted.  I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether it is now formal Government policy to amend the preamble and to bring it into line with the modern, enlightened and more sensitised political thinking of the diversities of this island now contained in Articles 2 and particularly in Article 3.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to an important issue raised by Deputy John Bruton which has not been given sufficient attention.  The difficulty which could arise in this area has not been fully taken on board by the Government or the Taoiseach. When Deputy Lenihan discussed this issue, he did not touch on the point of real concern.  A number of issues arise in the context of the making of the declaration to bring into effect these constitutional changes in the hope that they are endorsed by the people in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The criteria prescribes that the Government must make the declaration, when, in effect, the various institutional bodies provided for under the Agreement are put in place and particular progress is made.  The Taoiseach and Deputy Lenihan said the declaration will be made as a matter of international law and the Taoiseach dealt with some of the technical issues that could arise.</P>
    <P>There is one specific problem in this area which could and should have been addressed by the Government, by adding sub-clause 6 in the context of the new provision in Article 29.  A provision should have been inserted to the effect that the making of the declaration should be a matter for the judgment of the Government or the introduction of resolutions by the Dáil and the Seanad, but should not be a justiciable issue before the courts.  This is not in conflict with the Agreement but is a matter of mechanics and ensuring we comply with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I will explain what I mean in less technical terms.  In November 1995, the people made a decision in the divorce referendum.  The article voted for was not included in the Constitution until 17 June 1996, because Senator Hanafin launched a constitutional action to challenge, for a variety of reasons, the outcome of the referendum and the validity of changing Article 41.3 of the Constitution.  By bringing those proceedings in High Court and Supreme Court applications, the Senator delayed the amendment of our Constitution by seven months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> If this referendum is passed, two possible situations arise.  Someone may challenge its outcome which would obstruct the President signing the Bill necessary to include the clause.  This could delay matters but would not be fatal because it would happen within the envisaged 12 month time period which may be necessary before the declaration is made.  Whether that difficulty arises or not, we may be 11 months on from the holding of the referendum when someone may object, no matter what the outcome of the referendum is, to the amendments being made to Articles 2 and 3. He or she may decide, before the Government makes a declaration or before this House takes a view on the issue, to initiate litigation in the High Court to seek to prevent the Government from making the declaration.  This would be complex litigation which could take some months wending its way through the High Court and Supreme Court.  No matter what priority the courts give to it, it could delay the making of a declaration for four to six months.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent this type of event occurring.  Who could bring that type of action? Perhaps people who felt more prisoners should have been released or they should have been released more speedily would see this as a means of exercising pressure on the Government.  Perhaps someone who is ideologically attached to the Continuity IRA would see some value in bringing that type of court case.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that, constitutionally, if the people form a view and vote in favour of what we are proposing, and the possibility arises of the declaration being made and these articles becoming effective, it should not be a justiciable issue. The people will have spoken.  An individual representing a small minority should not be in a position to delay the making of a declaration in circumstances where such a delay could be misunderstood in one section of the community in Northern Ireland.  It might be exploited by those who wish it to be misunderstood and lives could be placed at risk because symbols on this island have such a powerful effect on everyday life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude the point I was making, what advice has the Government received on that problem?  What will happen if somebody tries, shortly before it is envisaged the declaration might be made, to make it a justiciable issue? That presents a real difficulty.  It is a matter we could address in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of whether the Government will make the declaration or whether it is a matter for this House and the Seanad.  It is my understanding that the formal Agreement concluded by this State on Good Friday has to be placed before the House for ratification. This would normally involve a formal vote.  I hope, however, it will be ratified unanimously. When will ratification take place?  If it is conditional on various events happening during the next 12 months with which we are all familiar, will it take place when the declaration is made? In the context of dealing with the issue in a democratic and politically correct way in the context of the Constitution, it is appropriate, if all the conditions that we require to be satisfied are satisfied, that the declaration should be made by the House and not simply by the Government.  As I understand it, the Agreement has yet to be ratified by the House.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will outline the timescale involved and explain why the House should not make the declaration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan eloquently made the case that we made in the context of resolving issues that might arise and which are a cause of litigation or dispute as a result of the Agreement coming into force.  Whether it is understood fully, it is inevitable that there will be a need for a common judicial body acceptable to all sides on this island and to the other international party to the Agreement, the British Government, to resolve disputes. Deputy Lenihan, somewhat whimsically, gave the example of a dispute at Tralee Circuit Court.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that major commercial disputes could come before the courts in the context of implementing some of the common policies arising from the Agreement.  It is not desirable or in the interests of harmony or progress that they be litigated separately in the courts of the Republic and Northern Ireland with the possibility of conflicting results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious issue and it will not be resolved by the Taoiseach suggesting that the matter could <Col N="1482" /> go to arbitration.  That is not the mechanism that will ultimately work.  Whether it is understood fully &mdash; I am sure the Taoiseach understands this &mdash; there will be common institutional arrangements which will lead to joint ventures which affect both sides of the island.  It is inevitable that disputes will arise which cannot be resolved within political fora or dealt with on an<i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is desirable that there should be an acceptable common body to resolve such disputes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a special privilege for me, having been a Member of the Oireachtas for 33 years, to be present on this historic occasion, particularly when the unanimity and common purpose of the Members of the Oireachtas, the elected representatives of the people, have been shown so effectively.  It is appropriate that this historic breakthrough should be greeted with unanimity.  This is a great tribute to the Taoiseach and the Government on their unrelenting commitment to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion on Good Friday.  It is, equally, a great tribute to the leaders of all the other parties for the generous recognition they have given to the significance of what is the end of one stage of the journey and, I hope, the beginning of an even more successful journey.</P>
      <P>The degree of unanimity evident among elected representatives here is reflected among elected representatives in Britain.  I have reached agreement with my co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to convene a special meeting of that body in Dublin shortly to enable its members to endorse the Agreement which arises from our generosity, confidence and commitment to build new relationships within and between these islands.  To that extent, we are anxious to endorse the achievement of the two Governments and all the political parties and, in particular, to ensure that those who will have an opportunity to vote in the referendum will do so vigorously in support of the proposals put before them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the issue of whether separate proposals should be put to the people. Precedent, as the Deputy is aware, is a reliable indicator of what one can and cannot do.  The provisions of the Bill contain a specific proposal. It states: &ldquo;Article 29 of the Constitution is hereby amended as follows.  .&rdquo; This is the text that will be put to the people and will be on display at every polling station.  It can be reasonably argued that there are two subsections, (a) and (b).  In that context, during the years proposals incorporated in a single Act were subsequently adopted, some of which would have had much less in common than the proposals to be put to the people on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to amend Article 29.  We have amended this Article more than once before.  I will refer briefly to the amendment which is now incorporated in <i>Article 29.4.3</i>º. It says &ldquo;the State may become a member of the European Coal and <Col N="1483" /> Steel Community established by the Treaty of Paris on 18 April 1951&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Paris, 1951, was one special element.  The European Economic Community was established by the treaty signed at Rome on 25 March 1957.  Two separate treaties were signed in two separate places for two separate purposes, though all involved a consistent approach to what we then viewed as the European Economic Community. The European Atomic Energy Community was established by the treaty signed on 25 March 1957.  That also was a distinct and separate treaty.  All of those were included in the single referendum proposal adopted by the people in the procedure we are now following.</P>
    <P>By way of confirming that approach, I mention that subsequently and even more recently, we followed the same procedure when we ratified the Single European Act, signed on behalf of the member states of the European Community at Luxembourg on 17 February 1986 and at the Hague on 28 February 1986.  These were two separate Acts incorporated in one Bill and one referendum proposal.</P>
    <P>It is fairly clear from the manner in which this proposal has been formulated that the precedent and advice will be the reassuring basis for what, will be a properly amended element of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>My second point relates somewhat to what Deputy Blaney said.  I endorse the views of my colleague, Deputy Lenihan, concerning those of us who have not really experienced at close hand the deep personal suffering, hurt and emotion. The North is a long way from Tipperary or Cork, whatever we think of our inherited traditions. Being closer personally and geographically to the hurt, suffering, enmity and bitterness over the years, it obviously impacted much more on the people in the North than it did on the rest of us.</P>
    <P>I can understand very well Deputy Blaney's expressions of reservation.  Despite those reservations, I acknowledge his readiness to endorse this historic Agreement.  Deputy Blaney mentioned that the Act of Union is unaffected by the Agreement as he sees it but if there is one clear and unqualified statement in the Agreement it is that the Government of Ireland Act is repealed. That obviously incorporates all that was included in that Act.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be helpful to Deputy Blaney if I mentioned section 75 because that too will go with the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act.  That section stated that:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the establishment of the parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland, the parliament of Ireland or anything contained in this Act, the supreme authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things in Ireland and every part thereof.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> The supreme authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom derived from the Act of Union, 1801.  It was incorporated in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  Given that the Government of Ireland Act will be repealed, all that is incorporated in it is clearly caught up in that repeal, including the Act of Union.</P>
    <P>The Agreement states that &ldquo;The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is repealed&rdquo;.  It is very clear and unqualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are engaging in this issue as political representatives as distinct from lawyers. The Agreement goes on to say &ldquo;this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding any other previous enactment&rdquo;.  That second element is unnecessary but, it makes it clear beyond any doubt that the Bill which will be enacted as a result of an historic development with the endorsement of all the people North and South shall have effect, notwithstanding any other previous enactment.</P>
      <P>Those two points relate to the broad constitutional issues and the legislation enacted before the 1937 Constitution and since then.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to recognise that the 1937 Constitution was an instrument of its time.  It underlined the identity of all the people and their allegiance throughout Ireland.  It enabled those who wished, to express that allegiance in contradistinction to what had been established in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  That Act and the Act of 1925 was the only legislation then in place.  Surely it was appropriate that there would be a constitutional confirmation of the position of the people of Ireland in contradistinction to that.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have said many times that Articles 2 and 3 were not a claim by us with regard to the people in the Six Counties, for the simple reason that we had no right to make such a claim.  No one ever suggested that those of us who legislated in the Twenty-Six Counties had the right to make a claim on the people in the Six Counties.  Such a claim would not have been consistent with the elements in the 1937 Constitution which has stood the test of time so well. The Constitution was a statement of the integrity of the island, but not a claim by us on the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>When we move into new relationships it will be the culmination of a close and effective relationship between both Governments.  I hope it will be the beginning of a new harmony and understanding on the island generally.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and I had the privilege of serving on the Committee on the Constitution with that great statesman and other senior figures from all parties at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to acknowledge the <Col N="1485" /> role of the former Chief Justice, Tom O'Higgins, Seán Lemass and Gerard Sweetman.  No one would object that two young Members of the Oireachtas like Deputy Andrews and myself had the privilege of being on that committee.  It is reassuring to find that the formulation of the all-party committee proposed is following that earlier committee very closely.  It borrows directly from the phrases and terminology of that committee. The report of the 1967 Committee on the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The wording which we would suggest is as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
      <P>2.  The laws enacted by the Parliament established by this Constitution shall, until the achievement of the nation's unity shall otherwise require, have the like area and extent of application as the laws of the Parliament which existed prior to the adoption of this Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note &mdash; I am sure the presence of Deputy Andrews at these negotiations had something to do with it &mdash; that those terms are reflected in the amended Article 3.  It states that &ldquo;it is the firm will of the Irish nation, in harmony and friendship, to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland, in all the diversity of their identities and tradition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to all those with whom we were privileged to serve in the Oireachtas, including Mr. Seán Lemass, Mr. Jack Lynch, with whom I was privileged to serve as Minister for Foreign Affairs when we had bilateral Anglo-Irish relationships, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, who brought about the first formal relationships in Sunningdale, and Mr. Charles Haughey, with whom I was privileged to attend the first Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin Castle in 1980.  It was at that summit that the phrase &ldquo;the totality of relationships&rdquo; first emerged.  I also pay tribute to the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Peter Carrington, who was a great parliamentarian and a consummate diplomat. He wanted to see the totality of relationships brought about in the manner in which the Governments have now done so.  This is the end of one period of understanding and we hope those of us not directly involved in the negotiations can help to develop a new era of understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision proposed in Article 2 is entirely consistent with the generous approach that is a feature of this Agreement.  Article 2 states that it is the &ldquo;entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation&rdquo;. That does not suggest that every person born in the island of Ireland must exercise that entitlement. It is a clear statement of an entitlement, the exercise of which depends on the citizen, North <Col N="1486" /> or South.  That opens up a new avenue of tolerance and understanding.  It is important to recognise that some people do not propose to exercise that entitlement now or in the future.  If that is their intention in perpetuity, we acknowledge that is their right.  However, we must also acknowledge that it is their entitlement to opt for citizenship under the provisions of this Agreement. That reflects the generous and confident approach which was a feature of the painstaking work that went into this Agreement.</P>
    <P>This is an historic event.  While one feels a certain tinge of regret that one was not closer to the action, it is a great privilege to be in this House in a week when we endorse what the two Governments have done in our name.  It is a privilege to contribute to this debate and I hope the few words I said on constitutional procedures and amendments will help Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>The constitutional and political advisers, which the Government is fortunate to have available to it, deserve a special tribute.  We were always fortunate that the advisers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach were aware of political sensitivities and nuances.  I have no doubt that they through their personal contacts and those of the Taoiseach and the Ministers will pursue constant contact with people who come from a different tradition on this island but whom we will respect in the same way as if they came from the same Nationalist tradition as ourselves.</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán Lemass proposed the formulation of Articles 2 and 3 and the 1967 committee enthusiastically adopted it.  When that was done we did not have the basis of the agreements which are now part of the proposals before us.  We were prepared then to make a recommendation in respect of Articles 2 and 3 without having the counterbalancing repeal of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  That was what we would have wanted.  The Governments have now agreed that, therefore it is essential that it is copperfastened and adopted by the people in the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the congratulations to all those in successive Administrations both here and in Britain and to the political leaders in Northern Ireland.  As a member of the Government in the 1980s when the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Peter Barry, negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I could not believe that we got concessions from the British which gave us an absolute right of consultation in relation to Northern Ireland.  That vehicle has led to this historic Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is like an extended Second Stage debate rather than a Committee Stage one because no amendments were tabled to any part of this Bill.  However, I cannot help feeling that we may be walking ourselves into a constitutional nightmare because of a lack of detailed consideration. I am not sure, for example, what happens if the Government certifies that the Agreement <Col N="1487" /> is in place, we amend the Constitution and then the structures subsequently break down.  The British can revoke their decision by an Act of Parliament but we will have amended our Constitution. What happens if the arrangements are in place and they are subsequently sabotaged as happened with the Sunningdale Agreement? There will always be questions about what will happen and if we allow ourselves to be burdened by those, we will not get anywhere.  Nevertheless, such questions need to be asked.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for a long time and in recent years I have been alarmed at the way the safeguards in our procedures have been constantly bypassed in regard to legislation and now in the case of constitutional amendments. It is inappropriate we should amend our Constitution by way of a Bill published a few days ago.</P>

      <P>Maybe the exigencies of this situation make it unavoidable, but there is something fundamentally wrong with that process.  It could lead to major problems down the road, as has been the case with many Bills that were rushed through this House.  The five stages of a Bill were designed so that legislation is considered in great detail to ensure we do not do anything in regard to the Constitution or anything unfair that would give rise to difficulties later in the courts.  Yet with great frequency the words &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders&rdquo; are used to set aside our Standing Orders and they are laden with great danger.  In this Agreement the word &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; is used more than once as in the case of &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in section 46&rdquo;, etc.  It is important that be said, notwithstanding the euphoria and the unanimity about the Agreement in this House and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Assuming the amendments to the Constitution are passed, this will be the 19th in a series of amendments to it and it is beginning to look a little untidy.  It no longer has a resonance of beautiful visionary language that one expects of a constitution.  There was a reference to implications in this for other sections of Constitution not referred to in this amendment.  Maybe we should consider some form of consolidation of the Constitution similar to the way we consolidate Bills.  From time to time we consolidate the Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill to make the totality of a Bill more readable and to facilitate cross reference of sections.  Perhaps we should have a similar provision for the Constitution after so many amendments to it have been passed. That would enable us in calmer and less rushed times to reflect on the totality of the effect of the constitutional amendments and their implications for other sections and people's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to compound the criticism I made that this Stage has become an extended Second <Col N="1488" /> Stage debate and I can understand why, but if this were the historic moment it is claimed to be, we would expect the press gallery to be full and the Leaders of the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left to be present. There is no sense of this being the historic document some of us believe it is or else there is a feeling there is nothing much we can do about it and why be present anyway?  That is a feeling many of us have about this House for a long time.</P>

      <P>Like previous speakers, I congratulate all those participating in the talks over the period.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, deserves specific mention.  His contribution was recognised in the poll ratings last week, but a range of other people have contributed to this process over the past ten years.  I am glad Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body because some of its members, including Peter Temple Morris on the British side and Peter Barry and Jim Tunney on the Irish side, have also made a major contribution.  They laid the basis for a recognition of the difficulties in the working relationships between the two Parliaments and matters have evolved from that point. People have an understanding of one another's problems and how legislation can provide for the changes required.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's rating of 84 per cent in the polls last week reflects more than satisfaction with success in achieving this Agreement.  There are other issues involved, but this Agreement was a major factor in the public's recognition of his role.  However, it is worrying that the findings of a poll taken at the same time reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicate many people were undecided on the matter at that time.</P>
      <P>The debate this morning, particularly in regard to Articles 2 and 3, was technical.  Those Articles are very important and it is appropriate they should be debated in detail, but there are many other issues involved.  Many of the public are unaware of the benefits to be gained from this Agreement.  There is a lack of knowledge and understanding in that regard and there is an onus on the Government, Members and all those involved to ensure they have the necessary knowledge before the referenda are held.  Despite the McKenna judgment, we must take every possible step to ensure information is made available to the public in language that is easily understandable. The majority of the contributors this morning have a legal background and they debated technical points.</P>

I am not happy about the stockpiling of copies of the Agreement in Garda stations, post offices and elsewhere.  The fact that the first printed copies of the Agreement were picked up within hours of being sent to those outlets is indicative of the interest in it. Those we represent are entitled not only to have a copy of this Agreement sent to their homes, but to be given some explanatory material on it.  That can be done without infringing the McKenna judgment.  These issues can be explained carefully in simple English.  Even the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill is so complicated that one finds it difficult to tread one's way through it.</P>
      <P>Civil servants and others have been correctly praised for their contribution.  They have worked on this Agreement for a long time and understand every aspect of it, but it is unfair to just present the Agreement to the public and ask them to adopt it.  There is great support for the contents of the Agreement throughout the country. I have attended many meetings since it was published and one might expect difficulties to be raised about certain aspects of it, but I have been pleasantly surprised at the reception it received. It is widely accepted.</P>
      <P>There is more involved in the Agreement than amendments to Articles 2, 3 and 29 or any other Article in the Constitution.  We need to explain about the three strands mentioned in it and spell out the major benefits to be gained from them. For the first time we will have an input in regard to rights, safeguards and ensuring there is equality of opportunity for the people in the North.  There is also the issue of the policing and justice system for the future in the North, which we condemned many times over the past 25 years. There are many other important aspects in the Agreement.  The day-to-day issues for the people who will be affected are addressed in the Agreement. The Constitution is something which we will defend strongly, and we will tease out any changes in it and ensure, as Deputy Bruton and others stated, that we do not have difficulties with it later.  Certainly, I would not want to see that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Deputy Blaney and others mentioned the confusion which they face.  If those of us who are professionals in the field have difficulty, just imagine the ordinary person on the street.  We need to spell out what is involved.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure a copy of the Agreement is sent to every home and that briefing material is provided also to explain the technical aspects of it.</P>
    <P>The debate over Articles 2 and 3 has always revolved in the public mind around their deletion. We need to explain what is involved in the amendments.  There is a huge emotional attachment to these two Articles and we want to spell out that the same Nationalist approach can be taken from the amended Articles.  It is important that people understand that.  I do not think the proposed changes in the wording will be contested by anybody, but there will be a need to spell out what is involved.</P>
    <P>Everybody has mentioned that this is an historic occasion, but my major fear that because the public does not understand, the people may have an attitude of indifference and may not vote because of ignorance.  It is important that we spell out to them that the potential benefits for the whole country are enormous.  The mechanism for doing that can be debated and decided by the people involved, but the suggestion has been made that the two referenda should not be held on the one day.  As an ordinary lay person and public representative, I am totally against that suggestion.  For practical reasons, I am in favour of having both referenda on the same day.  Bringing out the vote on the Amsterdam Treaty is one of the reasons, but there is also a practical one.  I do not want to spend £2.5 million or £3 million of public money in a wasted effort simply to satisfy somebody's suggestion that we hold these referenda on separate days.  I am quite happy to have the two referenda taken together.  They are both technical, difficult and hard to understand, but the onus is on us to make sure that people are given the facility to understand them.</P>
    <P>As a general note on the process, the three strands initially identified by Peter Brook, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the late Deputy Brian Lenihan have been maintained throughout this agreement.  It was of grave concern to many in this House and elsewhere that attempts would be made to eliminate the Strand Two element, which relates to the North-South relationship.  That was not a sticking point, but it was a worry for many of us.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a North-South Council is not a new idea.  In fact, it was provided for in two previous agreements, in 1921 and more recently at Sunningdale.  Nobody should regard these North-South bodies as threatening in nature.  On the contrary, they simply represent the logical co-operation between people who have far more in common than dividing them.  However, up to now the political maturity to allow the establishment of such bodies has been lacking and we all, North and South, have suffered as a result.  I note that the health services in County Donegal and across <Col N="1491" /> the Border have been working happily for a number of years in providing facilities and working together for the benefit of the community, the clients, the staff and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of useful and novel suggestions in the Agreement, including a new civic forum which, it is hoped, will bring together business, trade and voluntary groups.  I want all these benefits spelled out.</P>
    <P>I passionately believe in the unity of this country which is in the best interests of the people, North and South.  Partition was unjust and unfair. I accept the reality that the <i>status quo</i> cannot be changed without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  This is a sea change.  We are no longer asserting our right over these people, but that we will do whatever is to be done by consensus. I warmly welcome this Agreement.  I endorse it and commend it not just to this House but to the general public.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I will be brief.  Two matters arise from the debate.

I would be the last person to pose as an expert in bourgeois institutions, but a world without borders is actually the ideal of international socialism.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Surely Article 3 of the new Constitution answers the point, which is that &ldquo;the laws enacted by the Parliament established by this Constitution shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws enacted by the Parliament that existed immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution&rdquo;. Therefore, it is clearly defined.</P>
      <P>Two Fianna Fáil Deputies, Deputy Michael Ahern and Deputy Dennehy, have taken to task those of us who said that both referenda should not be on the one day.  Deputy Michael Ahern accused us of thinking that people were stupid. That was not the point.  It was a question of allowing a proper time for debate, particularly on the Amsterdam Treaty which is complex and important and will be overshadowed by the current discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dhá phointe agam.  Deineann an Airteagal 3 nua tagairt do na daoine a maireann in Éireann &ldquo;in éagsúlacht uile a bhféiniúlachtaí agus a dtraidisiún&rdquo;. Chím go bhfuil alt faoi leath ins an Chomhaontu faoi cheart an teanga i dTuaisceart na Éireann agus go ndeirtear gur ceart go mbeadh meas agus aitheantas caoi tugtha don <Col N="1492" /> Ghaeilge agus don teanga Albanach Ulaidh chomh maith le teangacha eile mionlaigh.  Tá sé fíor tábhachtach go ndeanfar sin mar nach mbeidh aon teacht le cheile ag daoine ó culraí éagsula mura mbeidh meas agus ionnanas idir tradisiún difriúla.  Gan dabht, tá gach chuid den pobail rí-thábhachtach ón bpointe sin.  Tá sé scanallach go ndéanann daoine airithe ón dá thaobh íarracht cheist na teanga a úsáid i modh seicteach. Ag an bpointe sin, is teacht le chéile na gnáth daoine an freagra do na fadhbanna seo agus ionnannas idir tradisiúin agus teangacha seachas go bhfaigheann an tua idir politéoirí atá gafa ag politíocht seicteach go minic.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Part II of the Schedule provides that the State may enact the Agreement, and then goes on to the proposed Article 3 of the Constitution. I am afraid that there is a major contradiction between the Agreement and what exists in Article 3 in the sense of speaking of &ldquo;the will of the Irish nation, in harmony and friendship&rdquo;, etc.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the structures of the Agreement envisage a permanent chasm between the communities and the institutionalisation of sectarianism rather than a coming together of people in unity.  Unfortunately, the choice before the people in the referendum is stark.  If the referenda fail North and South the reactionary sectarians on both sides will come back on stage with a vengeance.  We should mention today the horrific sectarian murder of an innocent worker, Adrian Lamph, in Portadown.  That shows beasts are lurking in the wings and they would be much to the fore if the referenda fail.  Given that there is no alternative on offer, the passage of the referendum is by far the more preferable scenario.</P>
    <P>Ordinary working class people have borne the brunt of suffering in the troubles.  The lasting solution to the problems in Northern Ireland is an economic, social and political alternative that can mobilise ordinary working class people.  Such an alternative based on democracy and socialism would unite the communities in the eradication of poverty, unemployment, homelessness and the shameful neglect of marginalised communities. That would be a genuine coming together at the base of society rather than something cobbled together by politicians, depending on sectarian divisions for their power base.  This was the approach of the great founders of the trade union and socialist movement of this island, James Connolly and Jim Larkin who worked tirelessly for the unity in action of working class people, Protestant and Catholic.</P>
    <P>The Socialist Party, my party, in Ireland continues that tradition.  The Socialist Party in Northern Ireland has played a very active role in opposing sectarianism, particularly in the ranks of the trade union movement and in workplaces.  Party members have been instrumental in mobilising thousands of workers, Protestant and Catholic, and their families in work stoppages and public demonstrations in opposition to sectarian killings and to the threats and intimidation of sectarian paramilitaries.  We will continue, North and <Col N="1493" /> South, with this work to build a powerful political movement across the Northern Ireland divide which will embrace working people, the unemployed and the youth, coming together in action, with a political programme of democratic socialism, overturning the system that has brought unemployment, poverty and sectarian misery for generations.</P>
    <P>This will also embrace the unity of working class people, North and South, in constructing a new society based on the prosperity, justice and freedom of opinion that genuine democratic socialism involves where borders become meaningless. A socialist Ireland, a free and voluntary federation of the people of Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, reaching out also to the working class people across Europe, is the structure by which the major economic and political evils in society under the present system can be overcome and sectarian and racist divisions bridged in a new society.</P>

      <P>I heartily congratulate the Taoiseach, the Ministers and their advisers, both here and in Maryfield, on the tremendous work that has been done on this Agreement.  We must all focus on our purpose here.  For many years major efforts have been made to achieve agreement on this island.  For the first time ever, historically the political leaders on this island have sat down and reached agreement about the future evolution of this country.  That Agreement is protected, copperfastened and underpinned by the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It behoves us as elected professional practitioners in politics to ensure we acknowledge the changes and recommendations made and that we give this Agreement an absolute endorsement. It is vitally important that the people have ownership of it.</P>
      <P>On behalf of a youth group in my constituency, I would like to read a letter issued recently to the leaders of all political parties involved in the peace process, which expresses the feeling of young people towards the Agreement.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Youth of Athenry, Co.  Galway, we would like to offer our heartfelt congratulations and sincere thanks to all of you for your courageous efforts in finally bringing peace to our island.</P>
      <P>Our town, Athenry, proudly boasts links with both sides of the divide.  Edward Carson, the founding father of Unionism, whose mother hailed from CastleEllen, a small townland two miles from Athenry, spent his summer holidays here and was proud to play hurling with the local team, Carnaun.  His kindness to the people of the area is legendary.  On the other side of the coin, Liam Mellowes, the leader in Athenry of the Easter Rising 1916 is fondly remembered here, with a National School and The Agricultural College named after him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> We belong to a generation who have witnessed constant violence in Northern Ireland. We salute your braveness in coming to this agreement.  For the first time in decades, the armlock of sectarianism and tribalism has been broken.  Fears, anxieties and prejudices can now be alleviated.  A lasting peace is now a real hope and Ireland both North and South can look forward to a great future.</P>
    <P>May God reward your efforts!</P>
    <P>Michael O'Regan, Niamh Kelly</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Youth of Athenry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the issue of the Government not being forced by the courts to grant votes to citizens wherever they live, they are relying on the territorial definition of the State, which is in the Government of Ireland Act &mdash; that is the only place it exists.  We are told that as part of this Agreement the Government of Ireland Act will be repealed.  This issue needs to be clarified.  I refer again to pages 14 and 15 of the book on the Constitution authored by Kelly and others.</P>
      <P>This Agreement should not be bogged down in the courts as the Sunningdale Agreement was bogged down as a result of an action taken by Kevin Boland.  To that end I make four suggestions. There should be a clear statement as to the form of the declaration the Government will make in saying that the State is obliged to implement the Agreement.  There should be a specific requirement that the Agreement should be approved by the Dáil, as required under Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution.  I suggest that the State should not be able to make a declaration that it is obliged by the Agreement other than on the basis of a resolution passed by the Dáil.  That is contained in my first amendment.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter argued, any declaration made by the State that it is obliged by this Agreement should not be justiciable before the courts. Nobody should be able to go to court to prevent the Government making the requisite declaration. It should not be capable of being bogged down in the courts.  That is the purpose of my third amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second amendment refers to the fact that it appears under the provisions herein contained that no court will have jurisdiction over the activities of a North-South body.  There cannot be a legal vacuum of that kind.  There must be a court to which an aggrieved person should be able to appeal.  I suggest that in the setting aside of the provisions of the Constitution and the application of other organs of State in regard to North-South bodies there should be one exception in regard to the provisions of Article 34.4º of the Constitution <Col N="1495" /> which allow people to appeal to our courts.  There must be a right of appeal to the courts, and that is the purpose of my second amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope on Report Stage the Government will accept some or all of those amendments, all of which are designed to ensure the Agreement is not bogged down in the courts as was the Sunningdale Agreement, that it works as the House intends and that there is legal certainty as to how it will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy McManus's point about the British recognition that some of the people in Northern Ireland are Irish citizens only, that may have implications down the line for the British rules requiring oaths of allegiance.  As long as our jurisdiction is confined to the Twenty-six Counties under Article 3, the organs of Government apply only to that area and the people must mean the citizens of the State.  The Deputy said that there is no definition of &ldquo;people&rdquo; in the Constitution. I answered that question previously.</P>
      <P>Deputies McManus and O'Keeffe raised the matter of constitutional reform.  A major programme of constitutional reform is being undertaken by the Blair Government.  Lord Alderdice has introduced a Bill covering a number of the points raised by Deputy McManus.  The oath of allegiance is an issue at Westminster but that is a matter for the parties with members elected to the House of Commons.  The oath is not an obstacle to the SDLP and it is not the only obstacle which applied to Sinn Féin.  I believe the Deputy implied that it was that party's sole difficulty but it is not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe inquired about the provisions of Article 46 of the Constitution.  The Bill contains only one proposal for the amendment of the Constitution, it contains no other proposal. This accords with Article 46.  The proposal is a single proposal in that its elements are inter-related and none of them can stand alone.  If there were separate votes on each element, the possibility would arise of an absurd and inconsistent result.  The Deputy made it clear he does not wish to see this happen.</P>
      <P>The Agreement was negotiated as a package and will stand or fall as a totality, North and South.  It is logically and politically correct to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to some elements and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to others.  All the proposed constitutional changes are ultimately interlinked and the advice of the Attorney General is that this is the correct approach and consistent with Article 46.  I assure the House that much consideration was given to that point in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the assertion that there is an unchallenged British claim to Northern Ireland, this places the matter in a distorted and simplistic frame.  In the Joint Declaration agreed between the two Governments, the British Government made clear that it has no selfish, strategic or economic interests in Northern Ireland.  Northern <Col N="1496" /> Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom solely by virtue of the principle of consent.  For the first time in their constitutional legislation, the British will introduce a clear mechanism for giving effect to a majority wish for a united Ireland.  It is obvious, from virtually every section of the Agreement, that Northern Ireland is unique in terms of the United Kingdom.  For example, the British acknowledge that a substantial section of the people in Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of the majority of the people of the island of Ireland for a united Ireland and they accept the right to dual citizenship.  A form of administration is to be established in Northern Ireland which has no parallel in any other jurisdiction and which is based on a recognition that nationalism and unionism are key determinants to identify in Northern Ireland and are both equally legitimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney raised a number of points with which I dealt this morning.  If I have time later I will return to them.  However, I do not want to repeat what I stated earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and others raised the making of a declaration by the Government and the role of the Dáil.  Steps to implement the State's international obligations are part of the executive power of the State which, under Article 29.4.1º of the Constitution, is to be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that matter in a moment.  With regard to the North-South Council and bodies, the essential point is that through the North-South Ministerial Council, structures are being created to enable North and South to work together in partnership across all matters within the competence of both Administrations.  That is an enormous and unprecedented step forward in terms of bringing together the different traditions on the island.  As stated earlier, the areas to be covered by the implementation bodies will be for final decision between the two Administrations, North and South, before the end of October.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter inquired about the Preamble to the Constitution.  That is a matter for the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  However, the Preamble is a description of our historical origins. We are prepared, in the general context of constitutional reform, to consider this and other parts of the Constitution.  The Deputy asked about my political position on that but we do not want to overload the Agreement with any further changes at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting debate took place between Deputies John Bruton and Brian Lenihan.  The proposed Article 29.7.2º enables any new institution to be conferred with powers in addition to or in substitution for any person or organ of state. This will allow the jurisdiction of our courts to be excluded in favour of an all-Ireland court or dispute resolution mechanism such as an arbitration <Col N="1497" /> body.  However, it is clear that the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of cases involving questions on the validity of any law is not affected by this provision and such questions remain matters for the High Court and Supreme Court on appeal. Therefore, the amendment suggested by Deputy Bruton is not necessary.  As Deputy Lenihan pointed out, other provisions of the Constitution are not excluded unlike earlier constitutional amendments.  For example, an implementing body operating within our jurisdiction will be bound to observe the provisions of the Constitution other than those conferring powers and functions on particular bodies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the definition of the term &ldquo;State&rdquo;, it is worth noting that the British, in repealing the Government of Ireland Act, will have no definition of Northern Ireland.  However, 78 years of practice and usage of the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; make clear what its boundaries are and they see no need to define the matter further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made the suggestion that the making of a declaration under subsection 3 should not be justifiable.  We cannot altogether exclude the risk of some court challenge.  The Hanafin action was not a constitutional action, it was an election petition.  I do not know if the Deputy is making the point that we should exclude election petitions but, in principle, it is undesirable to exclude the courts' jurisdiction. We have sought to tighten the provisions to ensure that there will be nothing for a court to consider as a justifiable controversy.</P>
    <P>The second part of Deputy Shatter's proposal is interesting but it cannot be completely proven. If we state that the Government's certificate is non-retrievable although someone may still challenge an earlier stage of the process, for example, the Government's notification under Article 4(2) of the Agreement or the legislation to establish subsidiary bodies.  At some point, the Oireachtas must have faith in judges' ability to separate a good point from a bad one.  While Senator Hanafin lost his petition, it would be untrue to state that he had no arguable case because the Supreme Court believed his case to be sufficiently arguable to allow him his costs even though he lost in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton raised the question of the territory of the State not being defined but there is no need to insert a definition.  The courts have held, on the basis of the existing Article 3 of the 1937 Constitution, that the area of jurisdiction as defined in Article 3 means Ireland minus the area of Northern Ireland.  This is not being changed. The reference to Saorstát Éireann will be removed but the new definition means the same thing, namely, the same area and extent of application as the laws enacted by the pre-1937 Parliaments.</P>
    <P>I was asked if the Oireachtas will be asked to approve the British-Irish Agreement?  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  A separate motion will be brought before the House for approval of the <Col N="1498" /> Agreement, pursuant to Article 29.5 of the Constitution, when the referendum has been passed and after the President signs the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the procedures of the North-South bodies.  In one form or another, these matters were debated under the three strands in the past number of years.  I confirm that copies of the Agreement will be delivered to every home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Micheal Ahern and others inquired about the position of Article 2 of the Constitution in international law.  It is important to note that Article 2 has no standing in international law because treaty obligations take precedence over rules of municipal law, where these are constitutional or merely statutory.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if a claim were made before an international court that Ireland was obliged to recognise the status of Northern Ireland, it would not be an answer for the State to say that Article 2 of the Constitution precludes it from doing so. The State is, therefore, potentially exposed to an argument that its constitutional claim is in violation of the Anglo-Irish Treaties of 1922 and 1925.  Such, a claim has not been made in an international court but as Ireland does not accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, there is no forum in which such a claim could be brought.  In any event such a claim would be a matter for states rather than individuals and it may be unlikely that the British Government, as distinct from one of the political parties in Northern Ireland which supports the union, would ever wish to bring such a claim.</P>
    <P>The conclusions from that is that in the sphere of both international and domestic law, the substitution of the new proposed Article 2 of the existing text will establish a much more sound basis for the right of persons born in Northern Ireland to membership of the Irish nation, and hence citizenship, than the existing text.</P>
    <P>Several speakers asked about the point I made earlier on Article 3.  The proposed new Article 3, taken in conjunction with the changes to take place in British constitutional legislation, the new British-Irish Agreement and with elements of the multi-party Agreement &mdash; accepted by the prounion political parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; makes a change of immense positive significance for the aspiration towards Irish unity, in that it establishes a legal mechanism whereby the unification of Ireland can come about without the interference of any person outside the island.  In this respect, the new Article 3 represents a considerable improvement over the existing Articles 2 and 3 which provide for no such mechanism. The mechanism that will now be established under the new Article 3 is the consent of a majority of people democratically expressed in both parts of the island and it thus reflects the agreed approach to self-determination and consent. That was set out in the Downing Street Declaration of 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> The implication of the acceptance of this proposed provision of the Constitution by the British Government as well as by the Northern Ireland parties supporting the union &mdash; the Ulster Unionist Party, the two loyalist parties and the Alliance Party &mdash; is the recognition not only of the separate existence of Northern Ireland for as long as a majority of its people wish it to continue but also the right of Northern Ireland to become part of a united Ireland if a majority of the people of Northern Ireland so wish.  The achievement of a united Ireland is made entirely conditional on decisions made by people on the island.  For example, it will no longer be possible as a legal proposition for a majority of the electorate in the United Kingdom or for a majority in the United Kingdom Parliament to block a united Ireland if a majority of the people of Northern Ireland want it.  This is an important change in the existing situation and, as a matter of law, the British Government will now be bound by a solemn treaty obligation, as well as by its own legislation once the agreed changes in that are made, to give effect to the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland should they decide in the future that they wish to become part of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asked me a number of questions but I will not have time to deal with all of them.  He asked about the wording at the end of annex A, the draft clauses and schedules for incorporation into British legislation.  He also asked about the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and assumed that included the other Acts.  That was the legal advice and the understanding.  This issue was raised many times as well as issues I raised when I had the opportunity of talking to the UK constitutional experts and others.  The understanding was that it included the Act of Union and all other Acts. This question was examined over several days and that was the legal advice available to me from all those who examined it.</P>
    <P>I realise time is limited but I will refer briefly to the amendments.  Amendment No. 1 is not necessary having regard to what I said earlier. Under Article 29.5 of the Constitution, the British-Irish Agreement has to be approved by the Dáil and will be brought before it by way of motion after the referenda and when the President has signed the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am advised the second amendment is unnecessary.  In regard to Article 29.7.2, it is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 34.1 to consider the validity of any law.  The amendment is technically incorrect.  It should refer to Article 34.3.1 as well as Article 34.4 to be effective.</P>
    <P>In regard to the third amendment, there is no practical way to prevent people going to court, even if the declaration is made non-justiciable. People can still challenge earlier stages of the procedure or they could bring an election petition, which action was taken by Senator Hanafin. One has to have some trust in the courts not to <Col N="1500" /> entertain nonsensical actions.  The reference to the two Houses of the Oireachtas introduces a discretionary element which would be contrary to the British-Irish Agreement and could interfere with the Government's exercise of the executive powers given to it by Article 29.4.1 in connection with the external relations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate, particularly Deputy Bruton who remained in the Chamber for the entire debate.  I accept time is limited.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11 February, before moving the adjournment of the debate on which we are now resuming, I mentioned that the decision to hold a general election in June was fortuitous for the education system, as the centrist bent of the previous left-dominated Government was cut off just in time.  The current Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, came on the scene and illuminated the whole education area with his dynamic performance at every level.  He has been willing to meet people and to listen to them which has not been done for some time.  The results of his deliberations are seen in this Bill which goes back to the process initiated by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and the extensive consultations with many groups, as a result of which process this Bill came into being. The information was available to the previous Minister, but she, for her own good reasons, decided to ignore what the majority of people wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> One item on which the former Minister was hung up was the setting up of regional education boards.  In our pre-election commitments we stated that we would remove that element.  The Minister has kept his word.  It would have cost £40 million which the Minister in the previous Government did not tell us about.  That £40 million is now being used to improve facilities in all our schools throughout the country together with large amounts of other funds which are also being made available.  It would have been extremely difficult to justify the setting up of an extra layer of bureaucracy using funds that are badly needed for disadvantaged pupils and substandard schools.  I welcome the Minister's decision to keep the promises he made prior to the election.</P>
    <P>Another central aspect of this Bill relates to the important role of teachers which is recognised in this Bill.  Under this Bill, teachers are to be consulted on matters relating to schools.  I have some experience, albeit only two or three years, as a teacher.  Being very junior at that stage, I did not expect to be consulted about anything that was going on.  However, other more senior members of the staff in the school where I taught felt they were not being consulted by the management of the school.  With the progression of time, that has changed.  This Bill now enshrines it in legislation, and I welcome the decision of the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of individual schools is enhanced by the statutory recognition of school patrons who will be obliged to appoint boards of management which reflect the composition of all those who have a stake in the school.  Since 1987, we have seen how co-operation among all elements of society helps it to go forward.  We had the programmes for national recovery, the PCW and other national agreements which enshrined the views of all elements in our society which came together to forge a way forward.  It is only natural that this should happen also in the education area.  If we do not all swim in the same direction the maximum benefit will not go to the people who are entitled to it, that is, the pupils. The spirit of this Bill is to get all elements in a school working together to provide the maximum benefit for the pupils therein.</P>
    <P>Accountability is another every important element of the Bill.  The boards of management are to be accountable to the parents.  Many of us are parents with children in school and are personally interested in what is happening in the schools.  It is only logical that parents should get information from the boards of management and that the boards of management should be accountable to the parents.  Boards of management are accountable to the patron and to the Minister.  The Minister is accountable to the people and his day of reckoning will come when he has to go before the people.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the measures in the Bill relating to children with special needs and the provision of extra funding for schools where there are children <Col N="1508" /> with particular disadvantages.  Great strides have been made in providing extra funding for disadvantaged areas.  Pilot schemes have been operated.  However, there is still a deficiency of remedial teachers throughout the country.  The Minister is attempting to ensure that he gets sufficient funds to improve that situation.  He has improved it already and wants to improve it further during his term of office.</P>
    <P>There is discrimination between schools which will have to be looked at.  In respect of voluntary secondary schools £1 per pupil is spent; in community schools, the capitation grant is £1.57; and in vocational schools it is £1.75. Members of the same family could be going to different types of second level school and one school gets more funding than the other.  This is not right.  The Minister should examine the position to ensure that one sector of our school-going community is not discriminated against, as is happening in this case.  This also applies where school chaplains are fully funded on a teacher's incremental salary in community schools, at a scaled rate in vocational schools, but where no provisions is made for voluntary secondary schools.  With regard to buildings, voluntary secondary schools must provide 10 per cent of any building costs, while the amount that must be provided by community schools depends on the type of school and the vocational schools pay nothing.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools are allowed £435 per square metre for building costs and vocational schools are allowed £682 per square metre.  Vocational schools are allowed 13.39 per cent for design team fees while voluntary secondary schools are limited to 12 per cent.  If there is an overrun on the cost of a new building, secondary schools must pay 100 per cent of the overrun, whereas the State pays 100 per cent for the vocational schools.  If a lift has to be installed in a school, voluntary secondary schools must pay the full amount.  I believe that all schools should be treated in the same manner.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to my attention that some fee-paying secondary schools are getting bills for rates.  The Constitution provides that all our children should be treated equally.  I ask the Minister to inquire into the incidence of schools being required to pay rates and the reason for it. I look forward to hearing from him in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the lack of true opportunity for education in certain sectors of society, especially in areas of high unemployment.  In the past many of us thought that educational underachievement was due to laziness or stupidity. However, in many cases that was not so and many people who underachieved are now unemployed or working in jobs with no future.  We had a myopic and patronising view caused by a lack of exposure to the lives and problems of people. However, as public representatives we can encounter and understand the problems of people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Many children are born into lives of State dependency with little hope of self-sufficiency <Col N="1509" /> and developing a better life for themselves and their children.  This sector of society will grow in each generation by a factor based on the average size of their families.  Something must be done about this.  Many excellent people are working to alleviate this problem and I will throw a new idea into the ring in the hope that it might be of assistance.</P>
    <P>My proposal starts with the assumption that there are clever teenagers being held back from achieving their true potential in terms of education and employment because of their family circumstances.  They most likely live in inner city areas or in sprawling council estates and may be exposed to drug abuse, poverty and have low self-esteem generally.  They see little hope in the future.  It is our responsibility to provide those teenagers and young children with the structures to allow them to achieve their potential.  They have little living space for themselves and have a peer group which has no respect for the system. We need to provide a new system if they are to succeed.</P>
    <P>This will not be easy and will involve a combination of proposals.  Much ground work and planning would need to carried out to ensure the success of the programme.  Participating students would enter a contract to pursue a specific structure of education with appropriate targets for achievement.  A code of conduct, support structures and motivational issues would be included. They would receive a weekly allowance to cover basic living expenses.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell the House whether agreement has been reached on the governing council of the new European Central Bank and whether it is <Col N="1510" /> intended to lobby for an Irish member of the governing council?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an opportunity to lobby for a person from this country we will do so.  The matter has not been resolved.  The Deputy will be aware from newspaper reports that the contest for the post of president of the ECB is between Mr. Wim Duisenberg and Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet but there is not agreement. The summit is approaching and I hope that will focus minds and resolve the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that the heads of government will make the decision in May and that the European Parliament will endorse the package.  Can the Taoiseach inform us if there is agreement on five of the six members of the governing council?  There is a suggestion that there is a possibility of a sixth position which might be held vacant for a British member should Britain join.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to seek an Irish member of the governing council?  What is the Government's attitude to the filling of the post of president of the ECB?</P>

      <P>I hope the discussions on this matter will be completed over the next few days. Since Christmas this matter has turned into a turf war between certain member states.  It would be better if this matter were resolved because it would be highly undesirable to attempt to make decisions on formalising arrangements without this decision having been made.  I do not want to go into the matter of candidates.  If the arrangements are made on the overall position everything else will fall into place and I think those matters have been resolved at ECOFIN level.</P>

      <P>Is an Irish candidate being put forward for one of the posts on the governing council? Is there a consensus among all but one of the member states on a single candidate for the head of the ECB?  Is it possible a third candidate may be put forward in the next ten days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility.  When President Santer was elected to the presidency of the Commission a number of nominations were made in the last few days.  That is a real possibility in this case.  The ECOFIN met on Tuesday and I am not aware of what decisions may have been made on other nominations.  The Minister for Finance may be able to provide that information.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a feeling in the Netherlands that any nomination they make for important international appointments is likely to be vetoed by somebody else?  Mr. Onno Ruding was vetoed for the IMF, Mr. Ruud Lubbers was vetoed for the presidency of the Commission and now the French seem set to veto Mr. Duisenberg for the post of president of the European Central Bank. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not helpful for one country to find itself being vetoed consistently, <Col N="1511" /> particularly when it is a small country which has made a positive contribution to the EU?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to get into diplomatic incidents by criticising one country or another.  It is regrettable that we are at this stage just ten days before making these decisions at the summit.  We have had the European Monetary Institute for some time and it was clear that it would move to the proposed arrangements, yet there is not agreement.  As Deputy Bruton knows, some of the larger countries have a large say in these matters.  However, on this matter they have not been able to see eye to eye.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment was established by the Government in October 1995. The primary role of the group is to monitor developments in the labour market, to facilitate co-operation between the relevant Departments and to contribute to the development of policy in that regard, especially with regard to long-term unemployment.  This, however, is not done in isolation, and such policies are for development in consultation with the social partners, particularly under the Partnership 2000 monitoring arrangements.</P>
      <P>The group consists of officials from the relevant Government Departments.  It meets on average every six to eight weeks and has met on 26 occasions to date.  Since October 1995, it has submitted five progress reports to the Government. It also submits reports on specific issues referred to it by the Government.  In the recent past, the group has been closely involved in the preparation for the Luxembourg Employment Summit and of Ireland's national employment action plan, our follow-up to the summit.</P>
      <P>The strategy group will also review the operation of employment programmes in the light of changing labour market conditions.</P>

      <P>I addressed the 15th Plenary of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Cavan on 30 March and I am circulating a copy of my speech to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>In relation to plans to promote public knowledge of the Agreement, a copy of the Agreement will be circulated to every household, and on a bilingual basis in Gaeltacht areas.  Copies of the Agreement have already been made available to the public through post offices, libraries and Garda stations throughout the State and will be available on request.</P>
      <P>A referendum commission is being established to provide information to the electorate in accordance with the provisions of the Referendum Act, 1998.  The Government parties will mount a campaign in support of the Agreement and I hope all the parties who support the Agreement will do likewise.  The Agreement is comprehensive and detailed and will involve change in a wide range of areas.  When it has been endorsed by the people, the Government will do everything necessary to ensure all its elements are put in place and that it is implemented fully and effectively.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the White House is still considering whether President Clinton may pay a further visit to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach expressed a view as to whether President Clinton should visit Ireland during the campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion was asked as to whether we could get general agreement among the parties on the matter.  President Clinton's special adviser, Jim Steinberg, will come here next week to decide on the matter.  The majority of concerns do not relate to our jurisdiction.  Mr. Trimble and others have expressed the view that such a visit could create disharmony, but it has not been ruled out entirely.  The view last week was that a visit after the referendum date and before entering the campaign for the assembly elections would be more acceptable.  A balance will have to be worked out next week.  Perhaps that would be a compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a better arrangement. Does the Taoiseach agree the assembly elections will be the most important of all the elections in practical terms?  If we do not get a majority of people in both communities elected to the assembly who are willing to make the Agreement work, it will not work.  There must be a willingness to make the arrangements work. The institutions will not operate without good will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Will the Taoiseach address the issue of the status of members of the assembly who will designate themselves as not Nationalist or Unionist, but who opt for the other category and will have less influence in the operation of the voting arrangements than those who opt for Nationalist or Unionist status?  Does the Taoiseach consider that in the longer term that could cause a difficulty in building new allegiances to the Agreement and to its operation rather than to ultimate aspirations which conflict?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the assembly elections are crucial.  I believe everyone, even those diametrically opposed to it, will take part in the elections.  If a large number of people who are opposed to the Agreement and the related institutional changes take part, it will be more difficult to secure a proper working relationship.  That is a concern for all of us.</P>
      <P>In terms of President Clinton's visit, the early date was suggested because it coincides with the G78 meetings in Birmingham.  The later date may not be possible.</P>
      <P>In the longer term it would be nice if the normal political positions of those in the administration and in opposition were democratic, like parliaments, assemblies or institutions in other jurisdictions, but I believe we are some time away from that.  As the Deputy will appreciate, one of the difficulties with the Strand One discussions, in which we were not directly involved, related to a concern that majority decisions could not be made without reference to the considerable minorities within the assemblies.  I hope in time the position will not have to be so designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming we arrive at a time when the delineation of Unionist and Nationalist does not have such an impact and the balancing mechanisms we all agree are currently necessary are no longer required, what legal provision will be in place to amend the balancing mechanisms, since they are an integral part of an international agreement?  Would it require common assent in both jurisdictions for that amendment to be made at a future date?</P>
      <P>If it is decided a visit coinciding with President Clinton's visit to the UK is not suitable, it is crucial that we underscore the importance of the President's role in the process and that we are not seen to devalue the tremendous role played by him and his administration in arriving at the Agreement on Good Friday.  When will the document be distributed to every household?  There was confusion about that last week and in my local public library the first allocation was four copies.  People are anxious for full information on this as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the arrangements with the President, I have already made it clear that the people very much appreciate all he has done.  The President has been helpful for so long and was deeply interested right up to the last <Col N="1515" /> hours of the Agreement when he was directly involved on the conference lines.  He does not want any controversy.</P>
      <P>We cleared the arrangements for the publication and distribution of the document and Supplementary Estimates were used to cover part of the cost involved.  The remainder will have to be cleared shortly because this morning's figures were for the referendum commission and I am sorry if I misled the House with regard to them.</P>
      <P>We have put everything in train.  However, the printing is not a difficulty and can be done quickly.  The Minister for Public Enterprise has been directly in touch with senior people in An Post about arrangements for distribution.  While I am not sure of the date, it should happen over the next week or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All those arrangements are within the remit of the new assembly because they are part of Strand One which will be negotiated directly by the new assembly.  I do not wish to say, having been well briefed on the fringe of those discussions, that we are likely to see changes in that regard over the next few years. However, it is the view of every Member that some day we will not have to designate as we do at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in the Agreement but the parties to it will have to be allowed to structure their arrangements because many elements are not present.  It will have to be done in conjunction with what is already in the Agreement and could not just be done in one day in the new assembly.  My understanding is if they wish to make changes to operational arrangements and there is agreement, they can make them. Agreement means sufficient consensus, it could not be agreement by a majority.  It would not be the case that the UUP and the DUP could come in some day and change them, a point that has been made by UUP representatives.  However, the parties would not be so tied down that they could not make changes.  I do not see such issues arising for a long time.</P>

      <P>The priorities include the implementation of legislative and other measures necessary to give effect to the Agreement reached in the Northern Ireland multi-party negotiations as the House has discussed; implementation of Partnership 2000 and the further development of the social partnership process; the ongoing development of national policy in relation to European and International affairs with a particular emphasis on ensuring an effective Irish input to the work of the European Council on major issues on the EU agenda; participation by Ireland in the third stage of EMU and ensuring that the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations meets our national needs are of special importance in this regard; deepening and strengthening the SMI process throughout the Civil and Public Service; facilitating access by the public to information held by my Department, as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act, 1997; promotion of concerted action in relation to economic and social policy, and maximising the contribution of the IFSC to the economy; production of a revised edition of the Government Procedure Instructions; a number of measures to facilitate greater co-ordination between the State's legal offices are being put in place, including a consultative committee to promote better liaison and communications among the legal offices on issues of common interest; an extensive programme of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the 1798 Rebellion that is under way and will continue throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The role and functions of the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum have been reviewed in conjunction with the social partners under the terms of Partnership 2000 and the Government has decided to renew the mandate of both bodies. The nomination procedure to allow for the reconstitution of these bodies is almost complete.  I expect to be in a position shortly to make an announcement on the matter.  A Bill to place both bodies on a statutory footing is at an early stage of preparation in my Department.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the main purpose of this strategy statement is to provide a means of comparing governmental aspiration and administrative performance?  If that is the case it is important that the objectives should be quantifiable and dated in terms of when they should be achieved rather than simply aspirational and general, where no means of actual assessment is possible?  Will he consider the introduction in the statement of dates for the achievement of particular targets to ensure there will be some basis for examining whether a section that was to deliver on a particular objective is doing the job at the pace expected by it and by others?  Will he agree in the absence of specific dates and targets this could be not much more than a purely aspirational paper exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible, dates for the achievement of targets are included.  I agree they serve as a check on the priorities in the Department and on what one is trying to achieve.  I can speak only for my own Department, how it was built up and developed since l994 when this initiative commenced.  Each group of employees and civil servants document what they are trying to achieve, discuss it and move it through the various divisions right up to the Minister &mdash; in my case the Taoiseach &mdash; and the senior officials. This ensures people are committed to it and that it is not a jumble of words and pious aspirations that are never implemented.  In terms of the discussions which have taken place in the Department of the Taoiseach, we have endeavoured to say what is achievable, how it can be achieved and monitored.  I am in favour of this procedure as otherwise one could fill hundreds of pages and yet have no implementation plan.  Most of the effort I have put into this &mdash; I do not want to overstate it because it was done mainly by the various divisions and the civil servants &mdash; was based on what I can realistically implement.  It is probably easier to do this in the Department of the Taoiseach than in some of the mainstream Departments.  It is a good practice.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Council is approaching the end of its current work programme, with the launch yesterday of the fourth publication from the NESC research series entitled Sustaining Competitive Advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> The council is working on the commitment in Partnership 2000 that the NESC, in consultation with the relevant Government Departments, will benchmark progress in the areas covered in the Partnership, both over time and by comparison with other countries.  The council is advancing this commitment through undertaking a broad analysis of benchmarking and studies in specific areas.</P>
    <P>A programme covering the period June 1998 to December 1999 will be discussed at the first meeting of the new council.  The programme will be built around key issues likely to be central to the next strategy document which will be prepared during the second and third quarters of 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will.  While NESC would take account of work proceeding in other areas, it regards the recently published work of the National Competitiveness Council as a significant contribution to its benchmarking process.  As far as that is concerned the answer to the Deputy's question is yes but it will not take over or interfere in any way with its work.  If the Deputy's question is whether it will take account of the National Competitiveness Council report in its benchmarking process, the answer is yes.</P>

It is an ongoing process and it is difficult to find any hard actionable recommendations at the end of hundreds of pages of prolix analysis from bodies such as this.  Will he ask the new NESC to concentrate on producing immediate actionable recommendations for which someone can be held to account and not studied compromises which mean nothing and simply provide a vehicle for the publication of the edited version of consultancy reports for which NESC has paid money?</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply on this matter last December, after my appointment as Taoiseach I met the financial services industry representatives on the IFSC Clearing House Group and senior ministerial colleagues to discuss the future development of the IFSC.  Following these meetings I asked the clearing house <Col N="1520" /> group to develop a strategy for the IFSC which would consolidate its successes of the past ten or 11 years and provide a platform for development into the next millennium.  The clearing house group has met several times since then and is in the process of developing such a strategy.</P>
      <P>A series of working groups which operate under the aegis of the clearing house group continue to develop policies which are directed at furthering the competitiveness of specific industry sectors within the IFSC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What action is being taken on the use of bogus Irish companies for fraudulent activity?  Has that revelation done damage to the IFSC?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the increasing worry in the US and elsewhere about the way in which Internet communications can be interfered with and money diverted out of people's bank accounts into somebody else's bank account?  Is he aware that German hackers were able to get into an American bank and take credit out of depositors accounts?  Is he aware also, with the onset of economic and monetary union, many people here will be banking in euros with the bank elsewhere and banking over the Internet and that the security of the Internet is a crucial financial issue requiring top level attention from the Government?  The Department of Justice needs assistance in bringing forward legislation on this matter urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation of Irish registered non-resident companies is in no way involved with the IFSC companies to which a strict regime of certification applies.  There is no evidence to suggest that IFSC companies are operating at less than the highest standards.  Nonetheless, I recognise that a perception of wrongdoing, however ill founded, seriously damages the reputation of the centre, as a centre where reputable companies are properly regulated.  It has been recognised for some time that there is a problem in relation to the manner in which some of the Irish registered non-resident companies have been conducting their affairs.  A sub group of the IFSC banking and treasury group, operating under the aegis of the clearing house group, is considering a number of proposals.  It has done substantial work in the past few months in this area and is considering it under the headings of taxation, company law and the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act. These proposals and others were recently detailed in a reply to the House by the relevant Minister.  The Government is committed to finalising and implementing a comprehensive solution to this problem as quickly as possible.  If not dealt with comprehensively, in time it would damage the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the second part of my question?  Will he address the problem in regard to the money laundering legislation? Is it not the case that it places a requirement on banks to report suspicious transactions? When we enter EMU, the likelihood that a bank manager will know his customers will decrease <Col N="1521" /> because people will bank in other jurisdictions. Irish people will be able to place their money on deposit in euros in Italy or Germany.  It will be much harder to operate money laundering legislation. Has this been dealt with at European level?  When is it proposed to extend the reporting requirements of the money laundering legislation to other financial operatives, such as estate agents, who could frequently be used as vehicles for laundering money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's last question, that matter is under discussion.  I am not briefed on what stage it is at precisely.  On the various companies and the work of the IFSC groups, whatever legislative or regulatory changes are required following the reports of the various sub-groups in the areas I mentioned, going back through the clearing house, will be taken.  They may be more regulatory than legislative.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's earlier question about the possibility of wrongdoing as regards transactions on the Internet, there have been a number of reports of this.  There is an examination under way in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see what legislative changes are required.  However, this also needs to be done in the financial area.  I am not aware of the decisions made by the Department on those matters but I can get the information for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Contacts between the managements of semi-State bodies and Government usually take the form of ongoing or periodic interaction involving the appropriate parent <Col N="1522" /> Departments and Ministers.  The Government of course frequently makes decisions affecting the operations of such bodies and, additionally, I am kept informed of other key developments and issues.  That process of interaction works well but is complemented, as the need arises, by meetings between myself and the chief executives of semi-State organisations, particularly those having an involvement or interest in the job creation area.</P>
      <P>A key Government priority in relation to the semi-State sector has been to maximise the conditions to enable such companies to be competitive and cost-effective in the provision of vital public services.

      <P>I tabled this question to the Taoiseach some time ago, as regards the importation of fruits and vegetables which can be successfully grown here.  The question was prompted by the by-election in north county Dublin when I visited the outskirts of Skerries and met a number of growers who are extremely disgruntled at the approach to marketing.  What policies does the Government intend to introduce to organise the marketing of vegetables?</P>

      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle rightly said, I only have the job of counting the vegetables.  I do not take responsibility for the policy aspect.  The Deputy will appreciate that many vegetables have been grown since the by-election. The total value of fruit, potato and vegetable imports combined for 1997 is £266 million.  I take the Deputy's point because, compared to the figure for exports, for the same year, it is £90 million, which is a significant gap.  There are strong Government policies to bridge that gap with which other Ministers will deal.</P>

      <Col N="1525" /> My Department received the expert group's report on 7 April 1998 and I am at present considering the way in which it may impinge upon the strategy adopted by the Government to deal with the Army hearing loss claims.  The Government will shortly examine a number of courses of action to deal with the problems which have been identified by an interdepartmental committee in this regard.  An adjournment of cases currently before the courts was granted in the High Court on 21 April 1998 and this will provide time within which to give due consideration to the complex legal and constitutional issues which the identified options have raised.  This work will be proceeded with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that if the Minister had gone to the courts yesterday with a detailed strategy, a different view might have been taken of his request for an adjournment.  The courts did not grant it and demanded that a strategy be put in place immediately.  There are many genuine fears about the costs, for example, in relation to breaching the Maastricht guidelines and the impact on health and education services.  There is a need to dispel the confusion surrounding the cases and the uncertainty about what the strategy will be.  Will the Minister consider enshrining the Green Book in statute to place a boundary around the problem given its scale and the need to do justice to genuine claimants and the taxpayer? That is the balance that will have to be struck in the strategy if cases are to be dealt with properly.  It is important that an individual's right of access to justice in the courts is protected but there is a huge policy issue in terms of fiscal demands.  There is also the question of the public good.  Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation within the next three weeks to enshrine the Green Book in statute?  Will he outline the other options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in dealing with this complex and difficult matter that we try to assemble all the parts on a more streamlined basis.  I accept the Deputy's contention that that is the way we should proceed.  As she is aware, the interdepartmental group examined the options.  I placed its report before the Government this week.  As the Deputy will understand, when one is dealing with potential constitutional and complex legal issues across Departments, there are many differing views but agreement was reached on a number of options which were placed before the Government this week.  Earlier this month the Green Book became available. Legislation has been prepared and will shortly be introduced in the House to restrict advertising in the context of personal injury claims.  Taken together, they represent a significant effort that is now crystallising.  That is one of the reasons I sought the adjournment.  I needed more time to do what the Deputy has requested.  I would have preferred if the courts had given me more time but in the three weeks available, I will be able to <Col N="1526" /> proceed with the introduction of legislation.  It is likely that the provisions of the Green Book will be placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that some order is restored to this scenario on which the newspapers have elaborated fully in recent days and weeks.  There is a need to establish a reformed Army pensions board or perhaps a statutory tribunal. This would have the effect of removing some cases from the courts.  Many Defence Forces personnel would prefer to use such mechanisms rather than the courts, although the courts would still be open to them.  Rather than offering upfront payments, pensions could perhaps be offered through a tribunal.  This would be acceptable and would balance the needs of genuine claimants and the taxpayer.  Action needs to be taken to ensure Defence Forces personnel have an alternative other than the courts.  If one is involved in an accident in the Defence Forces one has recourse to the courts only.  We will fail members of the Defence Forces if we do not put alternative systems in place.</P>
      <P>The matter is urgent.  This situation should not have been allowed to develop.  Has the Minister considered reforming the Army pensions board and the establishment of a State claims agency? This is critical.  As the Minister is well aware, there is huge criticism about the way claims are handled at Government level.  There is a criticism that they have not been handled in the most efficient way.  The Minister will probably accept there is room for improvement.  There has been stereotyping of claimants.  While I accept there are claims which are not genuine, it is not helpful to have the Army and the Defence Forces generally criticised to the degree they have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In this business one can be blamed for many things but I do not think I can be blamed for much of what happened in the past.  I am trying to identify ways by which this difficult question can be dealt with as quickly as possible to maintain morale within the Defence Forces and to ensure individuals with a significant handicap attributable to their service in the Defence Forces are compensated adequately while protecting the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated my desire to establish an Army compensation board.  I have been requested on a number of occasions to establish a tribunal.  It will be clear to anybody who wants to examine the matter closely that one would establish a tribunal in the knowledge, given the current quantum of awards in respect of minor hearing loss and wear and tear, that the normal compensation payable would be equal to that awarded by the courts.  My first obligation, therefore &mdash; I fought arduously to ensure this &mdash; was to ensure the quantum of awards came down.  We have succeeded in the <Col N="1527" /> past six to 12 months in securing a significant reduction in awards but they are still too high in respect of minor hearing loss compared to the awards payable to individuals in other organisations. If the level of awards in the courts was to come down quickly to the levels we could afford on foot of what is provided for in the Green Book, the need for a tribunal or Army compensation board would be apparent.</P>
    <P>There are more than 12,000 cases and the number continues to grow.  It will be clear that it will take the courts a long time to dispose of them.  I shudder at the prospect, given the damage that will be inflicted, perhaps permanently, on the Defence Forces and the friction that will be caused between plaintiffs and non-claimants who were on the same range on the same day.  I am extremely anxious to move towards a fast-tracking system under which substantial numbers of cases can be handled over a quick timescale but I am caught in a trap as any board or tribunal would have to have regard to the average quantum of awards.  In cases of significant disability, they may not be high enough but there is no doubt in anybody's mind that in the case of normal wear and tear they are not in line with those granted in every other jurisdiction.  Regrettably, they are too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Green Book is enshrined in statute, I am sure the Minister will accept there will always be conflict when it comes to expert opinion.  It is up to the courts to decide the level of awards, even if it is defined in statute. It is not necessarily the full answer but, given the scale of claims and the variations in awards, it appears to be the sensible route to take.  Does the Minister have a timescale in mind?  I agree this is the first step, and needs to be done before moving on to reforming the Army pensions board and establishing a compensation board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Defence Forces Regulations S.7 and its enabling legislation, the Defence Amendment Act, 1990, provide for representative structures for members of the Defence Forces, including the FCA and Slua Muiri.  The issue of a conciliation and arbitration scheme for the ranks represented by RDFRA has <Col N="1528" /> been raised with me by representatives of the association.  While I am conscious of the significance of issues raised by RDFRA, realistically, the representative system is primarily designed to address the issues affecting the livelihood of members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>RDFRA is not concerned with the day to day earnings of its members.  In this regard, therefore, the interests of RDFRA's members must be weighed against the interests of members of PDFORRA and RACO.  In reality, this precludes the establishment of a conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      <P>My comments on this issue are a reflection of the situation as it is and are not in any way an adverse reflection on the members of the Reserve Defence Force or the members of the association.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there are a number of unresolved issues which RDFRA feels should have third party intervention.  When I met officials of the association in January I asked for a list of four or five items that, from their point of view, needed urgent resolution.  The association has now corresponded with me and the matters it detailed are under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Having met the association, is the Minister not aware that morale is at a very low ebb because a conciliation and arbitration system is not in place?  From talking to members of the representative association, it seems to me that morale is so low that it will damage the organisation and the Defence Forces will suffer accordingly.</P>
      <P>Given the important role the FCA plays in the Defence Forces and the service it provides, surely it is not a major problem for the Department of Defence to consider putting a conciliation and arbitration system in place.  It would alleviate the problems that exist as well as ensuring that morale which I understand is at an all time low within the organisation would be increased.  We should put in place a sound basis for the development of the FCA.  In that way the Minister will be seen to have rectified current problems.</P>
      <P>Having listened not only to members of the association but also to ordinary members there certainly is a need for a morale boost for the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a background where, generally speaking, there is much sympathy and understanding for members of RDFRA and the Reserve Defence Force.  I appreciate the contribution it makes, particularly in so many outlying areas which are far from the main activities of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that the Defence Forces as a whole are going through a period of significant change and that in itself, places pressure on morale.  There are many other factors that combine to create certain difficulties.  A review of the Defence Forces is under way and sometimes fear of the unknown does not help.  That was why, in January, I asked the association to give <Col N="1529" /> examples of four or five matters that are hurting and said I would see to what extent I could help.</P>
    <P>One can have a conciliation and arbitration scheme or any mechanism one likes, but it does not necessarily mean one will resolve problems with it.  Having such a scheme does not guarantee any positive results.  It is important to distinguish between a system that is in place to deal with pay and remuneration for people whom one employs permanently and those who are employed by somebody else, but with whom one is involved in a voluntary capacity.  That distinction must be made.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to resolve any outstanding difficulties. My office is open to help and to make sure that such difficulties, which are creating a problem, will be resolved.  They must be put into the body of change taking place and which has put much pressure on many elements in every area of the Defence Forces.  I assure the Deputy, however, that while I cannot accede to his request, I am open to helping or providing any alternative I can find to resolve any difficulties which lie in the way.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister met the group to discuss a number of items which were of paramount importance, will he indicate when those four or five items, which he said were the major cause of disgruntlement within the group, will be dealt with?  Has the Department agreed to resolve some of those problems already?  Will the Minister tell me when the timetable will be put in place to rectify the problems discussed?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably well aware that the annual training gratuity and payment for the Defence Forces is exactly the same as for the Permanent Defence Force.  They took a considerable time to come to me in relation to their priorities but I was able to respond quite quickly in making provision for additional resources, which enabled the association to employ a researcher to help it in the process of the review.</P>
      <P>Within the limitations that exist, I am anxious to resolve matters like this as quickly as possible. As to how long it will take, some of the issues can be resolved quite quickly, while others will take a little time.  One may find that the final presentation of a solution will be different from what most people would like, but it is impossible to obtain unanimity on all these matters.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's reply he admitted that because of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, morale could drop in some cases.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 20, 30 and 133 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98, provided for special studies to be carried out on the Air Corps and the Naval Service. <Col N="1531" /> In July 1996, the Efficiency Audit Group engaged Price Waterhouse management consultants to conduct a review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a preliminary draft report to the Efficiency Audit Group.  This draft report highlighted issues which required to be studied in greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, rather than publishing a report that merely identified problems, it was decided that the consultants should examine these problems further in order to produce a report that was as comprehensive as possible and which could serve as the blueprint for the development of these important services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The consultants completed their review earlier this year and they submitted their final report to the Efficiency Audit Group in February 1998. The report has been considered by the steering group overseeing the review and it will be submitted to the Government in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am committed to publishing this report at the earliest possible opportunity.  I confirm once more that any matters arising from this review that come within the scope of representation will be the subject of full consultation with the representative associations.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing levels, the position is that both the Air Corps and the Naval Service have lost members to other employments.  This situation is not unusual in times of economic buoyancy.  The Department is in the process of filling a number of vacancies for watchkeeping officers for the Naval Service which were recently advertised in the national press.  The recruitment competition is open to all candidates, including any non-resident candidates who meet the eligibility criteria for the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that non-publication of this report is having a devastating impact on the Naval Service and the Air Corps? It has a devastating effect on staff morale and it makes proper planning impossible.  When did the Efficiency Audit Group see the report and has it completed its examination?  More than a year ago the Minister said it was a disgrace that this report was not published.  Is he dealing with it as seriously as he should?  It is impossible for the Air Corps and the Naval Service to plan or to take on new tasks with any certainty because everyone is waiting to see what is in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as conscious as Deputy Fitzgerald of the way this matter has dragged on. As I explained the preliminary draft was unsatisfactory from a number of points of view.  It did not go close enough to the problem or propose solutions and another considered effort had to be made which caused a significant delay.  Another reason was that when Price Waterhouse Management Consultants were asked to examine every <Col N="1532" /> aspect of the Defence Forces, the Naval Service and the Air Corps did not get sufficient attention at that time.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group received the report in the latter half of February.  The steering group in the Department of the Taoiseach has examined it and completed its work and is now in a position to present it to the Government.  The Deputy will appreciate that this work is done in the Department of the Taoiseach in the first instance and that for the past six weeks the steering group and the main personnel concerned were dedicated to another important area of activity which drew on almost all their resources. They achieved success in that task.  This report will soon be presented to the Government.</P>
      <P>A number of other Departments have signalled their intention to become involved.  As the Naval Service and the Air Corps are involved in a number of services, such as health, the marine or as an aid to civil powers, a number of Departments want to have an input.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the publication of this report.  Different organisations tend to worry about such delays, but the Naval Service and the Air Corps know what has happened.  They are aware of our commitment to ensure that the best possible solutions are produced to deal with the fairly significant problems which have emerged in terms of how these organisations will be sustained in the future.  I guarantee that once the report is presented to the Government, it will be published immediately thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt there are significant problems in the Air Corps and the Naval Service which need to be urgently addressed.  I hope the Minister realises the urgency of the situation. Is it possible that the Department of Finance is delaying the report because of its resistance to giving further resources to this area?  Can the Minister reassure the Air Corps and the Naval Service about staffing levels, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation to the rumour that the Department of Finance has been unhelpful in this matter.  It has not come to the stage where the Government must make decisions on future expenditure.  The expenditure for this year is already agreed.  Expenditure for the years ahead, in the context of what will emerge from the deliberation of the court will be decided in the months ahead.  There are rumours from day to day in many of these organisations. I will enlist the Deputy's help in quenching any rumours she knew about before she asked the question.</P>

      <P>We had an interesting meeting a couple of weeks ago at which we made a joint decision to ensure that a better fast tracking system is provided, particularly in the case of emergencies. We want to ensure that the Irish emergency services will be the first line to be approached and that the Naval Service and the Air Corps will be contacted thereafter so that all resources are available to deal with any type of emergency.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources would not indicate anything in the House to which he would not apply his mind immediately.  I might make a mistake, but there is no way he would make one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position as regards national brigade structures?  Is it true that the findings of the Price Waterhouse report are being pre-empted and that the numbers in the brigade headquarters are being reduced?  Is it true that the Minister intended to bring before the Dáil in February and March plans for a three brigade structure?  Will we have two national brigades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing badly today because Deputy Stanton is teasing me.  He knows I am not responsible for the decision to have three brigades. That was made by my predecessor, Deputy Barrett, and I have no quarrel with it.  The reorganisation of the Defence Forces was an important element in creating a more mobile, efficient, younger and fitter team.  In the intervening period, there was the voluntary early retirement scheme, the constant recruitment scheme and the decision to ensure that funds saved through the voluntary early retirement scheme would go back into equipment.</P>
      <P>There is a delay in terms of the reorganisation of headquarters.  We need an amendment to the Defence Act and we have already given a commitment to introduce that in this session so that there will be no delay in underpinning that change.  Some of the overall changes have been delayed but they are not of such import that they cannot be resolved fairly quickly once the legislation is passed.  Any rumours to the effect that I am moving people to headquarters are not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria during the period 12 to 23 March 1998.  The primary purpose of my visit was to see for myself the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and the people, of how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
      <P>I spent three days in Cyprus during which I met the chief of mission and the assistant chief of staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus.  I attended briefings by the assistant chief of staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus and the senior Irish officer in the force. I met the Cypriot Minister for Defence and also the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I also attended a medal parade for Irish personnel.</P>
      <P>Most of my visit was spent in the Lebanon where I met with the Lebanese Defence Minister, the Lebanese Chief of the Armed Forces and the UNIFIL Force Commander as well as other local representatives and dignitaries.  In all of these discussions there was consistent praise for Irish troops and a desire that they should continue in service in south Lebanon.  I toured the Irish area of operations, with which the Deputy is familiar, in the south of the country where I visited Irish UN posts and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate. Towards the end of my visit I met with the Syrian Minister for Defence in Damascus and also with Major General David Stapleton of the Permanent Defence Force who is Force Commander of the UN Disengagement Force, UNDOF.  I was greatly impressed by the commitment of all our troops in the Middle East to the important work they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.  I am pleased to report it was admitted on all sides that morale was tremendously high.  I also had the honour of meeting with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in Damascus.</P>

      <P>In view of the recently reported offer made by the Israeli Government early last month to withdraw from southern Lebanon, has the Minister considered how this might impact on our commitment to the area?  Does he consider our commitment to the area will cease or increase?  If it is to cease, has he discussed with the Chief of Staff other areas to which the Army may be deployed in peacekeeping missions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would dearly wish that we had reached the point where we could withdraw our troops from south Lebanon.  This year we celebrated <Col N="1535" /> 20 years of consistent service there and approximately 27,000 personnel have served there.  They have made an enormous contribution to creating the space necessary for infrastructural development and for life to return to normality.</P>
      <P>When I was reviewing the 83rd infantry battalion two weeks ago I said I hoped that they might be the last battalion to go there, but we do not have any way of knowing if that will be the case.  There are many obstacles to be overcome regarding security on the border, the enforcement of the United Nations resolution in that regard and other countries that have an interest in it. Nonetheless I look forward to the day when that permanent peace can be achieved.  As to what will happen thereafter, it is too early at this stage to say where our troops will be deployed, not knowing how long more they will serve in south Lebanon. Unfortunately in the world in which we live there will continue to be difficulties in many places.</P>
      <P>I have just returned from Bosnia where we have numbers of military police stationed.  Our experience in peacekeeping, the military and diplomatic skills our troops have developed, their patience in working with others and the fact that we are not carrying any historical baggage mean they will be welcome in any part of the world their services will be needed.  As to when our troops will cease to serve in south Lebanon and the decisions that will be taken about the redeployment of our troops, the House will decide on that, but for the time being our troops are serving in south Lebanon.  They will serve there as long as they are needed to help secure a permanent peace and thereafter they will be deployed wherever the demand for their service arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Minister's trip to Lebanon I heard a brief extract from an interview with the Chief of Staff broadcast from there during which he said he hoped the Irish forces might be relocated in the former Yugoslavia.  While I appreciate morale among our troops is high in Lebanon, does the Minister appreciate there is always a difficulty getting numbers to make up the full contingent?  Has he any plans to deal with this?  His predecessor said he would never force personnel to travel overseas despite a provision to that effect in the Defence (Amendment) Acts. Will the Minister comment on an announcement he made about an increase in the overseas allowance? Can I take it that increase is separate from an increase negotiated under the remit of Partnership 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a radio interview with the Chief of Staff.  Was it the Chief of Staff who announced an increase in the overseas allowance or is the Deputy suggesting I said there would be one?  Over the past number of years there was a growing problem in meeting our full commitment to UNIFIL because numbers <Col N="1536" /> had fallen for many years.  In the 82nd battalion Corporal Granville and Corporal Daly have served ten and 12 trips respectfully.  It is exhausting the possibilities of interest to think that we could have growing numbers attaching themselves to contingents where that number of trips is required.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that in the last battalion, the 82nd battalion, 169 young people travelled out on their first trip, the highest number in years, and this time the contingent was only 300.  My policy of constant recruitment will ensure that we will not face the problem I inherited ever again.</P>
      <P>Regarding the overseas allowance, in association with the representative organisations and under Partnership 2000 I hope I will have some scope to recognise and to make some small effort to help compensate those many soldiers, men and women, of whom I am immensely proud and who do much work for us.  It will probably take some eight months to finalise that, but I am determined to do something for them this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged it is difficult to get troops to join the stabilisation force in the former Yugoslavia.  Is that because of poor pay and conditions?  Is it also true that the training required by PAs before they undertake this course of duty has been reduced from four weeks to two weeks and, if so, why is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the former Yugoslavia is different.  We were asked for a particular force, which was primarily military police. If the request from the United Nations was for significant numbers in that area, as numbers contract in the new emerging Defence Force, we would not have the numbers to meet that constant requirement of troops.  We have sufficient numbers for the next contingent and perhaps the one after that.  I had discussions with the force commander when I was in Sarajevo and I indicated that if our troops were required into the future we would like to send a mixed team to take account of the fact that we may still have troops stationed in south Lebanon.  We have troops serving in Damascus, Cyprus and a significant commitment in personnel terms to the United Nations generally.</P>
      <P>As the numbers have reduced here and because there may be too many troops in one area and too few in another and the distance between them is to too great for one to complement the other, in regard to the maintenance of the services we provide here, the overall management of the force must be taken into account. There are no difficulties at present in getting our contingent together for the former Yugoslavia. Problems will emerge in a few years' time.  We have begun discussions to ensure that problem will be resolved in time to ensure our troops can continue the work they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been mentioned to me, but I do not have a strict military viewpoint on that.  The Deputy will appreciate that in terms of UNIFIL a substantial number may serve four to six tours of duty.  It is not necessary for those repeating a tour of duty to undergo the same training as new recruits.  I will investigate to ascertain if it is a bottleneck problem and I will report back to the Deputy on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Minister and his Department satisfied there are proper structures in place to deal with social problems among the families of serving personnel created by overseas service?  I come from a constituency from which I have seen many serving personnel go overseas and I have seen problems created thereby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this matter.  As far as the troops in UN service are concerned, there is fantastic camaraderie and they are great to each other.  There can be little crises which they must overcome and they come quickly to one another's help.</P>
      <P>Somebody who goes on such duty may find it a totally different experience from that anticipated and such persons need support. As the Deputy will be aware, small numbers return and it is important to have in place the support services for that.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly stated, we are greatly indebted to the families of troops who make many sacrifices.  They do not have their husbands, partners, brothers, sisters, sons or daughters available for important occasions in their lives, and of course they are not there when there are extremely difficult problems in the home also.  We must always acknowledge and appreciate that.</P>
      <P>I am looking at the general counselling and support services to bring them into the new millennium in terms of current thinking about the resolution of the kinds of matters which the Deputy and I when we were growing up ignored completely.  In a different world now, there are different kinds of pressures which need to be resolved.  We need to be up to date in our approach.  The professional services which are required to be called in are the ones which we have ourselves which need to be upgraded to cope.</P>
      <P>I notice that in Sarajevo in former Yugoslavia all of the troops who went there remained.  None had to come back.  In the last battalion about 13 or 14 returned for different reasons, some due to illness, domestic matters or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overseas service is a fracture in the home and it is something which must be looked at in a more considered and enlightened way.  I would hope, therefore, to help to build on the existing services <Col N="1538" /> to take account of the type of problems to which the Deputy refers, which I accept exist.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister support requests for Ireland to participate in what increasingly will be peace-enforcing missions?  In that context, would he support Ireland's involvement in Partnership for Peace?</P>
      <P>Has he considered a quick reaction force in cases where our Defence Forces would be asked to supply a group to deal with, for example, emergency humanitarian aid?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, some of the supplementary questions do not relate to the particular question on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to one of them, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am just doing badly.</P>
      <P>We do not have the biggest responsibility in the world for humanitarian aid, but it is an area which we should try to develop more.  We are on the ground.  We are close to the communities.  One of the things which interests me in the humanitarian aspect of it is that since the personnel are there, since they are already being paid and since they are working with the community, whatever humanitarian aid would be granted would go directly to the project and the return from it would be great.  In Tibnin we have the orphanage development and there are so many other areas where the troops do so well.</P>
      <P>As far as a quick reaction force is concerned, one of the reasons we need to modernise all the elements of the Defence Forces and have a more mobile, efficient, younger force is that it leaves a number of options open to future Governments to decide how to deploy these troops to meet whatever circumstance might arise which the Government would support in the context of our obligations to the UN.</P>
      <P>As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, clearly that is a matter which would first be referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and it is not a matter primarily for the Minister for Defence.  It seems to be an evolving process which is beginning to look considerably different from what it was in the beginning in terms of its potential relationship with NATO.  A number of countries have joined the Partnership for Peace. It is a matter which will return to the agenda again, but it is not something which is primarily my responsibility.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 49, 52, 58, 68, 96 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date in 1998 two applications for permission to retire have been received from pilot officers of the Air Corps, one a commandant with a current rating on the Gulfstream IV aircraft and the other a captain with a current rating on the Squirrel <Col N="1540" /> helicopter.  Both officers have been granted permission to retire in 1999.</P>
    <P>As of 31 March 1998 there was a total of 990 personnel serving with the Air Corps, 86 of whom were qualified pilots.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme for the Air Corps pilots introduced by my Department last year together with ongoing training of pilots and annual recruitment of Air Corps cadets is intended to maintain a continuous supply of well trained pilots for the Air Corps.  There are currently seven senior Air Corps cadets in training and a further ten cadets are due to commence training in May of this year.  A further intake of Air Corps cadets is planned for the autumn.  It may be necessary, however, to engage a civilian pilot or pilots as aircraft captains later this year due to the unprecedented number of retirements from the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>Advantage is taken of the availability abroad of aircraft simulators to train Air Corps flying officers.  The question of having an Air Corps reserve element is under consideration as part of a special study on the future role of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>As a result of the high number of retirements, the Air Corps does not have the personnel resources required to service the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources' helicopter based at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad situation for the Air Corps.  The Minister mentioned the intake of trainee pilots, which I hope will help.  The publication of the Price Waterhouse report is essential because this scenario is all part of that; it is not just about a buoyant economy.  Has the Minister taken any decision to increase the intake of trainee pilots?  That is one element of what needs to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell the House reluctantly that I am extremely worried about the Air Corps in terms of what has happened to so many experienced pilots in recent years.  The Deputy will be aware that taking the 1996, 1997 and 1998 complements together, one is losing almost 30 of the most experienced pilots on the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, Dauphin and Casa &mdash; the more important elements in our aircraft armoury as far as the Defence Forces are concerned for air and sea rescue, fisheries surveillance, ministerial transport, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming anybody.  The civil aviation industry just took off and substantial offers are capable of being made to experienced personnel. It has hit us extremely hard.  Looking back at the record over the years, we lost three or four pilots to the civil aviation business, but the loss of almost 30 pilots in less than three years is a significant indent into our total resources.  I did not know until I became Minister for Defence what was involved in becoming a pilot, with strict aviation criteria for flying that type of aircraft.  I knew that those people had to be very skilled and <Col N="1541" /> have a lot of experience, but a considerable time is involved in training.  In the context of the ongoing recruitment programme, I will see to what extent I can increase the numbers, bearing in mind that the same pressures apply in the Naval Service and the Defence Forces generally in satisfying number requirements.</P>
    <P>The problem will not be resolved by simply increasing numbers.  Significant changes must be made.  I am anxiously awaiting the report on that matter which will help to ensure that, following significant work on the part of the Air Corps involving sophisticated training, we do not become the training ground for a lucrative civil aviation business and are unable as a result to do essential work in sea and air rescue.  While I am concerned about this matter, it does not diminish my determination to find solutions to the problem. I will not be false to the House and say that the loss of 30 people in such a short time has not caused horrific problems for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for initiating training overseas.  Part of the training takes place in the US, France and Spain where off-aircraft systems have been developed which enable substantial training to be provided.  We use those facilities whenever possible.  We are talking not only about facilities but also the length of time it takes to become a skilled pilot.  When trained pilots may be attracted to another business.  I will explore every avenue to ensure we continue the kind of operation that took place in the past, but there is a body of activity in the civil aviation business which I cannot compete with in financial terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree his deliberate policy of allowing a run-down in the FCA and the Reserve is leading to a drop in recruitment? Will he agree a 33 per cent drop in the number of recruits in the FCA in the past three years is alarming?  The problems with recruitment to the PDF outlined by the Minister are mirrored in the FCA.</P>

      <P>On general recruitment to the Defence Forces, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the FCA, this year during difficult times when we had to deal with the question of hearing impairment claims, there was a significantly increased number of applications, about which I am delighted.

      <P>Many young people would welcome an opportunity to have a career in the Air Corps and we should provide that opportunity for them and for the country.  There is a serious problem with recruitment and an action plan must be implemented to deal with it.  Is that a priority for the Minister?  There is an extraordinarily serious problem and there are about seven or eight actions the Minister could take to address it &mdash; I outlined them in the House previously.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Wall, I addressed the question from an equally important but different angle.  We are awaiting the report on the review of the Air Corps and it would be impossible to talk about an action plan until we have an opportunity to deliberate on that report. It will be necessary to quickly reach conclusions, and the Deputy's suggestion is an option which will be seriously considered.  In answer to Deputy Fitzgerald, to implement an action before considering the report would be putting the cart before the horse.</P>

At the same time we should not ignore the reality of what is happening in the outside world, which puts enormous pressure on us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has left a proud mark on education in this country while in power, particularly since Donogh O'Malley's term of office in the mid-1960s. <Col N="1544" /> This farseeing and imaginative Bill, which underpins the authority of our school system while strengthening accountability, is to be welcomed. I congratulate the Minister on his excellent work in respect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating a substantial Education Bill.  Education is of major importance to the well-being of individuals and society.  It can make a huge difference to the life of an individual or the workings of a society to have a proper education system in place.  If a person does not benefit from education, it can have a major impact on their future life and determine whether they can play a useful role in society and live a fulfilled existence.  Similarly, if the education system works well for everyone, we can be assured that we will have a healthy society.</P>
      <P>Education is hugely important and it is necessary to set down in legislation how the system and its structures should work.  It is important that this Bill has been introduced.  However, we must inquire about its nature.  What should and will it do or achieve in the form in which it is presented? The Bill defines the nature of our education system, explains that system's existence and regulates it.  I compliment the Minister on that part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the education system has evolved and developed in the past without the need for a broad legislative basis.  At present, it is a huge edifice with many aspects, some of which are very good or excellent but some that are not so good.  What will the legislation do for the education system?  In what way will the Bill change or improve it?  I do not believe the legislation does enough to improve and develop the existing system.  It does not do enough to deal with the gaps, problems and inadequacies in the system.  It does not do enough for those whose rights must be safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I commented on the importance of education for an individual's development.  Many individuals do not obtain much from the education system and this Bill should address their needs.  The rights and entitlements of those individuals should be placed in clear focus in the Bill.  I do not doubt the Minister's commitment and I saw evidence of it last week when I witnessed an address he gave at Mary Immaculate Education College.  I am impressed by his commitment to education.  Having said that, however, I am disappointed by the Bill because it seeks to maintain the <i>status quo</i> rather than attempting to change it in any radical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be attempting to change the system in a number of radical ways because there are clear inadequacies.  When the various teachers' unions met during the past week, many of those inadequacies were pinpointed.  For example, it was highlighted that there are many groups of children who, for one reason or another, do not fit into the existing system.  The Bill should address that fact.  However, in the context of the <Col N="1545" /> inadequacies to which I referred, it is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not do much for those for whom the system has not delivered.  There are many groupings in this area including those caught in a cycle of disadvantage who drop out of school at an early age, either in the transition from primary to second level or at second level.  It is estimated that between 25 to 30 per cent of pupils drop out of education before completing second level. That is not good enough.  Many children are expelled from schools and the Bill does nothing to address how they are to be dealt with in the education system.</P>
    <P>The third grouping to which I intend to refer at length are children with special needs and those with disabilities who have been particularly let down by the Bill.  The original Bill introduced by former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach catered for the needs of children with disabilities in a broader way than the current legislation.  I hope the Minister will be willing to consider amending it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach to children with disabilities should involve investment as is the approach to other children.  The word &ldquo;investment&rdquo; is used frequently in respect of children in general within the system.  However, the emphasis in respect of children with disabilities seems to be placed on the cost involved rather than education as a right and an investment.  The rights of these children are limited in the legislation by terms such as &ldquo;availability of resources&rdquo;, &ldquo;practicability&rdquo; and &ldquo;ministerial discretion&rdquo;, to the extent that they are not real rights in their practical implementation.</P>
      <P>Children with disabilities are no longer included in the long Title to the Bill as they were in the original legislation.  This is not acceptable and I would like the Minister to ensure that reference to such children is put back into the long Title.  There must also be a definition of the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill.  As drafted, the legislation does not include such a definition.  More importantly, we need to determine what is appropriate. The Bill uses the term &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo; but there is no clear definition of what is appropriate.  Who decides what is appropriate? Many parents of children with particular special needs or disabilities have had to enter court proceedings to determine their rights to education. That should not be the case, particularly when this substantial legislation could define and determine those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal from the Federation of People with Disabilities which suggests that there should be an individual educational plan for children with special needs so that these needs are followed through within the education system. Section 42.3.4º of the Constitution states that the State shall provide for free primary education.  It does not state that primary education will be provided <Col N="1546" />&ldquo;as resources permit&rdquo;, &ldquo;as is practicable&rdquo; or &ldquo;at the discretion of the Minister&rdquo;, it is a clear definition of constitutional right and it should apply completely to children with special needs and those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that children do not learn in the same way or at the same pace.  I acknowledge that the system works extremely well for average or above average children but it does not work particularly well for those with special needs.  We must make statutory provision for the differing needs of these children.  There should be a plan to ensure that this is done.  Despite the fact that the proposal for education boards put forward by Niamh Bhreathnach was criticised in various areas, particularly on grounds of cost, if it had been introduced it would have provided a mechanism to put in place such a plan at regional level to ensure that the needs of all children are taken into account.  Provision should be made in the legislation for an appeals system so that parents who believe their children's needs are not being accounted or catered for can have their case heard without the need to enter court proceedings.</P>
    <P>There are other issues of concern to those who speak for children with special needs or disabilities such as the overlap between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. The parents of children with severe and profound mental handicap are particularly concerned that, by and large, their educational needs are considered to come within the ambit of the Department of Health and Children.  There is a need to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains definitions in relation to support services.  I would like the Minister to consider including speech, language and occupational therapy, as well as areas like transport and other technical aids, under the support services heading in the Bill.  In that way, these areas, which are of concern to parents of children with disabilities, can be fully dealt with in the legislation.  It is also important to know how appropriate education facilities for people with special needs are determined.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation schools are required to have their own plans, but each plan should include a strategy for dealing with children with disabilities.  That would require schools to consider the way they could include children with disabilities in their school campus.  In addition, the report that each school board is required to produce should also show the steps the school has taken to ensure children with disabilities can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Where practicable, these children should have the option to attend regular primary and second level schools, although obviously in some cases it is more appropriate that they attend special schools.  Many parents are of the view that with minimal adjustment, their children could attend regular primary and second level schools.  The Bill should contain a measure that would encourage schools to take steps to ensure that is possible. <Col N="1547" /> Teacher training colleges should have modules on disability awareness so that it is part and parcel of training teachers.</P>
    <P>We are sick and tired of talking about the Celtic tiger but at a time when there is relative affluence in our society we should be in a position to address the particular needs in the education system.  We should be willing to allocate additional funding to education from the national budget.  I do not believe taxpayers would object if they were asked to give extra funding at national level provided it was directed specifically at areas with specific problems.</P>
    <P>We would have fewer social problems if there was intervention at an early stage for children with special needs.  Many excellent studies on education have been carried out, and experts in this area have highlighted the importance of early intervention where there are specific problems. Insufficient action has been taken in this area.  We have had the Early Start scheme and the Breaking the Cycle initiative but they were not developed.  Those initiatives were introduced by the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, but they have not been given additional resources since they were set up.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to put extra resources into those areas and to identify specific problems such as ADD, ADHD and dyslexia.  If the needs of these children are not met at an early stage, they will become disruptive and fall behind in their education.  By the time their problems are properly dealt with, it is too late to make a difference.</P>
    <P>Parents of children with such problems have told me their only hope for intervention is if their children break the law and the prison system becomes involved.  That is a terrible indictment on our society which I do not lay at the door of the Minister.  We must find the funding to intervene in these areas at an early stage to make a real difference.  Support organisations for children with these problems have carried out a great deal of research in this area.  Many of those organisations have set up their own privately paid for institutions to deal with these problems.  In Limerick a dyslexia centre, for example, does excellent work and has outreach centres in other parts of Munster and beyond.  Those centres are poorly funded.  Most of the funding comes from private subscriptions, which is not acceptable.  We must address those areas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the support groups for ADD and ADHD have identified their needs and, in many cases, they are paying privately.  That should not be the case because it is the job of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure we provide appropriate facilities in the national system for these children.  Society would benefit greatly if that were done.  Many youngsters who cause problems for their fellow citizens would have followed a different life path if their problems had been addressed at an early stage in the education system.  The children who are described as being out of control have simply not fitted into the system. <Col N="1548" /> There are a number of special schools, but most of them have long waiting lists.  Resources must be directed in that area.</P>
    <P>Boards of management should be mandatory; this is not absolute in the legislation.  Obviously there is an aspiration to have boards of management in every school, but I understand some schools still do not have them.  Children will not have a safeguard if they attend a school which does not have a board of management.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not entirely relevant to the Bill, but I know the Minister has been asked to consider the question of more flexibility in the primary system in particular.  This matter was raised recently in relation to teachers who are trained in Northern Ireland and may not have the appropriate level of Irish.  I am talking about flexibility in general.  Those trained in the Montessori system and who have other types of educational expertise should be incorporated in the system.  It is almost monolithic at primary level and, therefore, we should seek to provide more flexibility under this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes difficult for parents to ensure their children have the full benefit of the education system.  I am talking about simple matters like the renting of school books.  Some schools operate this system, but many do not.  The renting of school books could be incorporated as a mandatory provision in the Bill so that the cost of books would not prevent children from taking part fully in the education system.</P>
    <P>Another old chestnut is the weight of school bags.  I am aware the Minister has established a group to examine this problem.  What progress has been made in that regard?  We talk about the development of the individual child, but the physical development of many children can be affected by the weight of school bags.  This is an important issue because we should be concerned about the physical development of children as well as their mental and spiritual education.</P>
    <P>My main concern is for children with special needs.  By and large the system caters well for the majority of children, but if we are to call ourselves a caring society we must prioritise those with special needs.  If we do not, we will be taking the easy way out.  We are doing well by the majority of young people.  In that regard I compliment the Minister on the work he has done in the area of information technology, but we are failing many children with very serious needs, whether in terms of social disadvantage or particular educational disabilities.  We need to focus on those children, many of whom get very little out of the education system.  Those who need it most very often get the least out of the system.  While that prevails, we should use whatever scope this legislation gives us to redress the balance.  He will also have received suggestions from the various organisations that represent these bodies.  It should be obligatory, not optional or just dependent on resources, practicability, discretion and so on to deliver to these people in the system.  These constitutional rights should be pinned down in <Col N="1549" /> this legislation.  I hope the Minister will take these points on board.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Sullivan on her election to the Dáil.  We served together in the Seanad.  I hope she will serve a long time in this Chamber, as I hope I myself will.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill although a number of things I say might sound contradictory.  I have wanted to make some general points on education for a long time, so I am taking this opportunity to make them.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a range of issues relating to rights and duties arising in respect of education, which we seem to have lost sight of over the years.  The purpose of education, which seems to have been lost sight of also, is to send young people out into the community with the ability to reach their full potential.  If one mentions education now, it is seen in terms of employment of teachers.  I welcome the opportunity to bring the focus of the debate to duties and rights in respect of education, and to the rights and entitlement of young people to the best education possible which will help them to reach their full potential.</P>
      <P>I note that it is the Minister's intention to achieve many objectives and that in trying to do so he will embark on consultations with a number of groups, including parents' groups, teachers, teachers' unions, etc.  I wish him well because probably the biggest stumbling block he will encounter will be the teachers' unions.  In the course of the teacher union conferences, delegates spoke negatively about aspects of the Bill which I deem to be very positive in terms of education as I perceive it.  No other issue stimulates or arouses passions and debate in any community as much as the issue of education.  If any of us were to be called to a meeting in our constituencies tonight on an issue of education, we could be quite sure that the meeting would be packed to capacity.</P>
      <P>I welcome a number of aspects of the Bill. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the phrase &ldquo;within available resources&rdquo;.  I understand the point she makes.  Referring to &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; seems to detract from the intent of the Bill.  However, it is my understanding that that is what was in the Bill published by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, and it has traditionally been included in all education Bills.  That is not to say any legislation would supersede the constitutional right of young people to have the education to which they are entitled.  However, I support the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 refers to promoting opportunities for adults to avail of education.  I welcome that very much.  Before I became involved in politics, I was involved with an adult education group and found that finding an area in which to park adult education was the biggest problem.  To be fair to the vocational education committees they were the only group who would take any interest in the area or facilitate us in providing various types of courses for adults.  Another big problem was finding <Col N="1550" /> premises.  It is ludicrous to suggest that there are no premises that could be made available, given the huge number of school buildings around the country.  However, the group in which I was involved went out of existence because the rooms we were using had to be given to other groups.  I do not accept that availability of premises is something that cannot be tackled.  We need to enlist the support of school principals and boards of management to ensure that rooms which are not being used by schools in the ordinary day-to-day business of providing education to young children can be made available for adult education.  The Minister should certainly push in that area.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also refers to promoting the right of parents to send their children to a school of their choice.  That is very important.  During the previous debate on education there was a feeling that schools with a Catholic ethos were being degraded and that all schools should be non-denominational. What we have to ensure is that there is a right to choose.  It is the parents' right to choose which should dictate the kind of education we provide.  Nor would I suggest that we should simply abolish a particular type of education because it is felt that it is not the way to go.  The right of parents to choose the type of education they want for their children should and will dictate the type of schooling we make available.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Group which examined the interdenominational schooling available in the North and the gaelscoileanna.  If we looked only at one system of education we would be sold on it.  We met the interdenominational people and they were convinced that interdenominational schooling was the way to go, that it was the only way to integration, the only way to peace.  However, the other providers of education argue very forcefully that they contribute in their own way to the right of parents to choose the type of education they want.  They have what is called EMU &mdash; education for mutual understanding &mdash; and various other things.  We should not come down on one side or the other in terms of education, and block off all other choices.  The type of schooling we provide should be determined by the right of parents to choose.</P>
    <P>At last week's debate at the teachers' conferences, and in the context of the British-Irish group, there was reference to bilingualism and the need for Irish.  There were conflicting views from the INTO which has representation in the North and in the Republic.  One view was that a teacher from Northern Ireland could not be employed in the South, despite being a qualified teacher.  I understand that the position is that a teacher has three years to complete the Irish language requirement for primary school and a year to reach the required standard for second level. Teachers would admit that it is not tremendously difficult to obtain the céardteastas.  I would not support the suggestion that there should be no requirement at primary level to have the Irish <Col N="1551" /> language.  Irish is one of the core subjects in primary school.  It is only right, therefore, that teachers wishing to teach at primary level should be qualified to teach Irish.  Even in the interests of partnership in the context of the debate we had this morning on the British-Irish Agreement, it is not sensible that teachers wishing to teach in the Republic would not be required to have an Irish language qualification.</P>
    <P>I support the reference in section 6 to extension of bilingualism in our society.  The situation whereby Irish was forced on pupils has long since changed and this is something we encountered on our visit to schools in the North.  There is a cultural awakening and an embracing of the Irish language.  People are coming to it of their own will.  The past arrangements whereby one could not pass the leaving certificate without Irish have changed.  We do not need to drop the Irish language requirement.  The providers in the North with whom we spoke made the point that they needed more teachers with Irish.  We should wait to see how matters develop.  I support the reference in section 6 to the extension of bilingualism.</P>
    <P>The school inspectorate was criticised at the teachers' conferences and I find that difficult to understand.  As a parent I would like to know what people find objectionable about establishing procedures to assess the efficiency of the operation of school management, including the quality of teaching and the academic standards of students.  I am not and have never been a teacher but I cannot understand why school managers or teachers would consider such a provision unacceptable.  The Minister has made it clear and it is obvious in the Bill that we are not talking about a points rating system which applies in the UK, whereby parents made choices between schools on the basis of a league table of performance. We are talking about ensuring schools are able to provide the best quality education to children. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to educational disadvantage and we must ensure that children are not disadvantaged, regardless of where their school may be.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this provision is objectionable to some.  I wish the Minister luck with the trade unions.  However, this is not an issue on which he should have to give ground to receive a positive response.  I advise him to hold his ground.  This is a basic premise of education &mdash; something to which children are entitled and which parents should demand.</P>
    <P>Admissions policy must also be addressed.  In areas of growth and where pupil populations are diminishing there are accusations of poaching and creaming off pupils with entrance exams.  Every school should set out its admissions policy.  Such policies should be based on the catchment area &mdash; for post primary schools that should be the primary schools in the various parishes &mdash; and additional places might be extended to others who apply.  There must be open and transparent admissions policies, as referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> The withdrawal of recognition for schools which do not satisfy requirements is included for the first time in legislation.  This refers to identifying schools where the education to which children are entitled is not being provided and taking action.  There has not really been any form of sanction for schools which do not perform. Schools should not be shut down but they should be supported and put back into shape, so to speak.  However, there has not really been an effective sanction available to the Minister.  Such arrangements coincide with the theme of rights and duties which runs through the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 refers to the determination of where additional funding is needed for students experiencing educational disadvantage.  Despite the application of additional resources, the early start programmes and other initiatives, further improvements are needed.  We need to focus on areas of disadvantage and if money were to be made available it should be spent on such areas. The early start programme has a great part to play.  It is the case, particularly in areas of disadvantage, that the earlier children are brought into school through early learning the better their chances.  However, early start programme ignored the providers who were there beforehand.  I have made the point in the Seanad that the programme was so organised because there was pressure from the teachers' unions.  Before the requirement of the programme for a qualified primary school teacher and an assistant was introduced how did all the children who came through community pre-schools manage to do so well?  If the Minister is considering expanding the early start programme, he should consider including the former providers and giving them an opportunity to obtain a qualification which would enable them to partake in the expanded programme.</P>
    <P>All Members are aware of cases in which children taking a subject with a particular teacher need to seek grinds.  It seemed that nothing could be done.  There must be a way of dealing with such circumstances in which most of the classes are fine but where there is a consistent exception. We should not seek to penalise teachers who are not performing up to par but we must ensure they get the in-service training or other supports they need to ensure they perform to their potential.</P>
    <P>I have been on three boards of management. At present I am a member of the board of management of Coolmine school in Blanchardstown, which is an excellent board of management.  It seems to have anticipated having to put in place all the measures required by law.  It seems to fit into the criteria as defined by the Minister.  It sends newsletters to the parents and the students and there are regular board meetings.</P>
    <P>I resigned from the board of management of another school because I believed the way in which problems were being dealt with was wrong. There have been instances of such problems, in particular the suspension and expulsion of pupils, in the newspapers recently.  That school was in a very disadvantaged area and it had a high number <Col N="1553" /> of pupils who might be considered troublesome. Suspensions and expulsions came before the board of management regularly.  We could say that it was our responsibility as legislators and the Minister's responsibility to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that suspending young children from school is the best way to deal with problems. It simply lets them out of school.  On a number of occasions I have suggested that they be kept in school, for example to clean the school if that was felt an appropriate punishment.  However, there should be a way to keep them in the school system.</P>
    <P>The response to my suggestion was that schools would be responsible for children kept after school and, therefore, a proposal other than suspension was not acceptable.  I am not talking about violent pupils who attack other pupils or teachers. I knew a young boy who was deemed not to be academically suitable to do his leaving certificate because he was not putting in the hours at school. Many of us in this House, myself included, would probably have been evicted from school if the same criteria applied in our day.  I urge the Minister not to allow a school suspend or expel a pupil simply because the principal believes he or she could not pass a leaving certificate examination because of lack of effort.  There must be other ways of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The young man to whom I referred had serious problems at home and was expelled from the school.  He then went to another school which was a long way from his home but did not fit in.  His mother later threw him out of the home.  I know that young boy did nothing wrong because he lived with us for some time.  He later died from a drugs overdose although, to my knowledge, he was not heavily involved in drugs.  Reported in the yesterday's newspapers was a case of a person in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The response from those who have had the benefit of a good education is not acceptable. When a person applying for a teaching post is asked how he or she would deal with such children, he or she quickly and efficiently outlines a number of ways they would deal with the matter, but in practice teachers cannot cope and the children suffer as a result.  If it means taking on the teacher unions, something must be done about this problem rather than allow young children, mainly boys, fall through society's net.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to adopt a number of measures under the legislation.  I welcome section 28 which deals with the right of appeal.  He must tackle the question of young children who are expelled from the school system at ten or 11 years of age because of a lack of school attendance officers.  That is the area that concerns me most and I urge the Minister to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with a most fundamental aspect of the State's organisational control and development of her children.  Education is the great social equaliser, releasing the power and potential for people to move within the social structure of the Irish community while equipping those who wish to travel or work in other countries. The skills they acquire ensure they do not end up in the low paid run of the mill jobs their forefathers were forced to accept, but that they are to the top of the appointments lists when the good jobs are given out.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  It has been a long time coming.  It deals with strong interest groups, who have their own views on how education delivery should be organised.  The Minister recognises the changing society which demands inclusion in decision making.  No longer is it acceptable to leave the control of this important social builder in the hands of a few.  It is important that we provide for openness, accountability and inclusiveness.  For too long educational management has been a closed shop, which denied itself the value of the wisdom of the other stakeholders.  I concur with the Minister's view in respect of regional education boards, they would be a considerable waste of public money.</P>
      <P>The concept of establishing a county education network is good as it could be workable.  It would involve developing a country-wide educational philosophy, ensuring services are complimentary and meet the community needs, without squandering public funds.  Many educational needs are met on the double rather than by developing courses.  We must ask if there are too many service providers?  Should non-primary and second level activity be controlled exclusively by the VEC education officers?  This would ensure value for money and a quality product leading through to a composite and recognisable certificate of award.  The issue of local control and accountability is important.  The work commenced by a former Minister, Richard Burke, in 1974 in establishing the board of management system in vocational education schools has stood the test of time.  It has played its part in the success of the development of community colleges and schools. I am aware County Dublin VEC has in some fashion developed his concept and in the interest of democracy has afforded empowerment to the parents through tenure and overlap of service.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased the Department accepts that projects, such as Youthreach deserve board of management status.  The Department, in conjunction with the County Dublin VEC, has put in place a model of those boards, drawing on the experience of the staff, the local business community and members of the committee.  Boards of management are important in that they give a say to sectors involved in the life of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider how students at second level may have their voices heard at the management table.  Some schools have been successful in involving their students in management projects and students have formed disciplinary committees <Col N="1555" /> to make recommendations on sanctions to the school managers.  Many schools invite students to contribute to the establishment of codes of conduct and decisions on uniforms or give them control of the management of the school shop.  Those schools are facing up to the reality that things are changing.  We must engage with young people and not be afraid of them. They have much to offer.  There are challenges for those who hold power.  We must learn to share while encouraging openness accountability and responsibility.  In drawing up guidelines for the boards, I ask the Minister to address this matter and push interaction between students and boards of management.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comments on the gaelscoilenna movement are welcome.  The revival of interest in the Irish language is great and we must do all in our power to promote it.  I am aware of the Department's support, in the establishment of new schools, for this revival, but more is needed. SchooIs must not be allowed compete for students on an unequal basis.  We must ensure the best buildings and facilities are made available. This would show practical support for a welcome development in education and reflect our confidence and pride as a nation.</P>
    <P>Education commences at birth and concludes at death.  We must meet the different needs which exist during a person's lifetime.  Action must be taken to provide what is termed pre-school education for all children of the nation.  This is not just an issue for families who because of work requirements wish to place their children in a créche. It is one of stimulating and servicing in a socially structured way, the natural eagerness of young people to learn.  Money put into early focused education is money well spent and it will save the State later.  It will pick up those with learning difficulties at a point where intervention is most effective.</P>
    <P>In the area of adult education, great opportunities exist for those who keep their skills up to date.  We must ensure that dynamic education services, meeting today's and tomorrow's needs, are delivered in a focused and cost effective way that reaches out to all.  We have a long way to go in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cosgrave for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and examine the educational provisions in the State.  We have evolved a diverse system of education that is the envy of many other countries around the world because of its quality.  We can be proud of the quality of education of our students who emerge from primary, secondary and higher education institutions. This is signified by our ability to attract many international companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system evolved in a piecemeal fashion and we should be grateful to our forerunners who did such a great job.  Tribute should be paid to the teaching profession.  It is a model of <Col N="1556" /> good workmanship comprised of people who go about their work in a dedicated fashion and produce results.  Teachers, like politicians often get a hard time on popular radio talk shows and are severely criticised, but when they are compared to their counterparts in other countries, they are found to be top class and this should be recognised.</P>
    <P>Within the profession, the role of the principal should also be recognised.  The Minister as a former teacher will acknowledge a huge burden of responsibility is placed on school principals.  They often take up the posts without any formal training on how they should manage schools or staff. They do a tremendous job and should be complimented for it.  The Minister should examine how middle management in schools can be made more efficient as there is a need to improve it.  Middle management should be rewarded for their efforts but additional rewards should be given for training and greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>The religious bodies have done a great deal for education over the years.  It is popular in the media to criticise the Christian Brothers and nuns for what they did but were it not for the dedication particularly of the Christian Brothers founded in Waterford, many towns and villages would not have received the quality education they did.  Various orders of priest, nuns and brothers put a great deal into education and they should be thanked.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the Bill following the election and he lived up to his promises in that he made the changes to the original Bill which he forecast.  When writing a script or formulating a response to a parliamentary question, once the initial draft is ready it is much easier to amend and improve it.  However, the Minister recognised the difficulties in the original draft and made amendments, some of which I wholeheartedly welcome.</P>
    <P>He moved sensibly in regard to regional education boards.  I had grave reservations about them and when I spoke on the original Bill, I expressed these.  I acknowledge the role intended for them.  They were to be a halfway house between the Department and schools but I was not sure there was a need for them.  Manchester has the same number of pupils as Ireland and has two education boards looking after the entire schoolgoing population.</P>
    <P>The other major difficulty with education boards was the cost implication, which the Minister homed in on when in Opposition.  A huge cost was involved and we could not reconcile setting up education boards and maintaining the VEC structure.  Perhaps it was political cowardice that we did not have the guts to say we would go with one or the other.  Dropping the boards is no harm and while the Minister has been criticised by various bodies, such as the National School Parent's Primary Board and the Conference of Religious Superiors who expressed reservations, he was correct.</P>
    <P>With regard to the imposition of boards of <Col N="1557" /> management on all schools if we were starting in a green field site we would say all schools should have a board of management but recognising how the education system evolved, we must be aware it cannot happen in certain schools as there are 25 privately owned secondary schools.  I know one fine individually owned school in Tipperary and the pupils demonstrate with their feet the fine establishment that it is.  How could we go to this individual who has bank borrowings, etc., and tell him he must hand his school over to a board of management to run?  It would have been constitutionally wrong and the Minister sensibly amended that.  I recognise what he has done in the second draft of the Bill and commend him for it.</P>
    <P>He reinforced the statutory recognition of parents' associations in the original Bill which is very worthwhile.  We cannot overemphasise the need to involve parents in the education of their children. For so long, they were not involved and it is important they are given various educational roles.  We must tread carefully on occasion as some parents lose touch on a merry-go-round of sub-committees and review groups.  I am reminded of one individual who is almost a full time junketeer on various committees and is associated with one parents group.  This must be avoided and areas of responsibility for parents should be spread among parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, was reprimanded in one of today's newspapers by a parents' group which quoted him as saying it could be a charter for busybodies.  I do not agree with him in that because parents bodies have been tremendously worthwhile.  At a time when resources are in scarce supply parents in most schools must row in to provide additional funds by running raffles, dog nights, etc.  They take on much of that responsibility but should not only be seen as fundraisers.  They have a role in setting out criteria and standards for schools and that should be respected.</P>
    <P>Another good aspect of the new Bill was dropping the concept of an annual report.  It was sensible because there would have been many difficulties for schools in producing them, including the cost factor and the competition that would have been generated between schools.  They would have gone all out to produce a glossy report so that they would be able to attract students in their areas but it might not have had anything to do with the quality of education in the school.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with some of the deficiencies. The description of the Bill reads: &ldquo;An Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the education of every child in the State&rdquo;.  That is a laudable aspiration.  I welcome it and it is important to insert a commitment to treat all children equally.  I regret the reality is that some children do not get a fair crack of the whip.  I refer particularly to the disadvantaged.  It saddens me that there are some children who do <Col N="1558" /> not get the opportunities they should get and are not treated equally.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today a representative from the Association of the Severely and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped said that currently only 460 to 480 of the estimated 3,000 severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children in the State actually receive free primary education.  If that is true, it is a huge indictment of our system that so many children, albeit with major problems, are not receiving the type of education they should receive.  Given their problems they should get extra help.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are difficulties.  A young man in my area, who has behavioural problems has not been able to attend school for the past three years because he needs a child care assistant who has not been sanctioned by the Department or by the Department of Health and Children.  It is a shame he should miss out on his education because that additional resource is not available to him.  I understand from the Department there are 250 such children throughout the country in need of child care assistants to help them at school.  These individuals cannot function properly at school without those assistants and it is a shame they cannot be appointed.  I urge the Minister to make that his priority.</P>
    <P>Children with hearing impairment also have difficulties.  A school in Ballymahon, not far from my area, caters for deaf children.  Recently following the tabling of parliamentary questions I discovered that class was discriminated against when compared with other schools throughout the country.  The pupil-teacher ratio for that school was out of kilter with that of other schools for the deaf.  I am pleased the Department has responded and it may be due to the parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>The other item I wish to raise is outside the remit of the Department but I ask the Minister to liaise with his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children on the provision of language therapy for deaf children.  The provision of such a service is hit and miss throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill did not refer to school transport.  School transport is important in rural areas where there are many problems, including overlapping of services and crazy situations where people in house A can get school transport to a school while people in house B which is next door cannot get transport to the same school because of the catchment area.  That type of problem should be resolved.  I encourage the Minister to address that issue.</P>
    <P>When summing up will the Minister consider the issue of health and safety in schools.  A friend who works as a health and safety officer informs me that if he and his colleagues were to do their work in schools as in factories and other places, schools would rank badly.  I do not want an Army deafness type scenario developing.  We cannot have two sets of standards, one for schools and another for everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and recognise it as one that will bring some order to education. It recognises the involvement of all the partners in education: parents, patrons, students, teachers and the State.  I welcome the various headings in the Bill which deal with the issues that have been outstanding for some time.  That State examinations will be reviewed and listed on an ongoing basis is essential because change will be necessary as we develop into an age of technology that is fast running ahead of each of us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision not to proceed with regional education boards.  The saving of £40 million will be better spent in mainstream education than in setting up a bureaucracy within the education system.  Boards of management are welcome.  The partnership outlined earlier stressed the importance of boards of management, many of which have been established in areas which had the foresight to appoint them. Local communities were first to recognise the need for boards of management and the participation of all those involved in day-to-day school management.  The role of boards of management is different from that of a number of people in a local community who are asked to raise funds. Their role goes far beyond that.  I am pleased the Minister has spelled it out clearly in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Irish language, its place in our communities and the development of gaelscoileanna are important to the development of the overall education system.  Given that we are moving into a new united Europe it is important that our culture and heritage is protected within the education infrastructure I welcome the various sanctions against students and others who make examination papers and other information available to the public or to a number of participants in any one examination. The introduction of fines for people who deliberately do so is welcome.  The imposition of a penalty against those who steal the information and put it on the market is welcome.</P>
      <P>The appeal procedure within the system for students or others in relation to the board of management is welcome.  Like previous speakers I pay tribute to the sisters, brothers and priests who participated in the education system in the State and helped to develop it.  In the past they were the only people who provided an education system and gave leadership on how education should be developed here.  I mention particularly the Christian Brothers and others who are often criticised in the media for one thing or another.  There is another side to that story.  A large number of pupils were turned out in an excellent fashion and play a full role in society today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recognition of the role of parents is important.  Parents of young people participating in the education system, have many responsibilities placed on them.  Parents who participate on school boards will have a responsibility and every parent carries the responsibility of educating his or her child to his full potential.  That is not an easy process.  Along with being involved in <Col N="1560" /> schools' boards of management and raising funds, parents must deal with the process of homework and ensuring the student is not left behind in the system.</P>

      <P>I hoped the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, would be here to deal with this Bill because the last time I spoke on the licensing laws, he told us there would be a seminar on 24 April.  He did not tell us that the fee for entry to that seminar would be £65.  My constituents in the west would not earn £65 in three weeks because of the effect of zero tolerance on the licensing laws.  Will the Minister scrap that £65 charge?  I also asked him to scrap zero tolerance in the west but he said he could not interfere with the daily running of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of Education to convey this message to him.  The senior Minister says he cannot interfere but the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, asked the Garda to cease the zero tolerance campaign.</P>

      <P>It is typical of Fianna Fáil to speak with two tongues.  I want to know what the position is.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, tell me if legislation will be introduced, as Deputy Fahey said, before the summer?  How successful was Deputy Fahey's request to the Garda to stop zero tolerance in the west?  I support that call.  It amazes me how the Minister cannot interfere with the daily operation of the Garda yet a Minister of State can ask them, on the airwaves, to stop the policy of zero tolerance.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not have implemented zero tolerance in the west.  Why was the west singled out?  If it was anything good or money was involved, the west would not be singled out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I go out a great deal in Dublin and zero tolerance here is not operated as it is in the west.  Zero tolerance has had a major effect on <Col N="1561" /> pubs in the west.  I met a delegation in Mayo recently who were upset at this and ask for legislation for 26, not five, counties.  I have no problem with the legislation being applied across the country. If zero tolerance was implemented in the 26 counties, some Fianna Fáil Deputies would have a great deal more to say.  The five western counties may not have the same clout as Dublin but I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey &mdash; because he seems to have more influence on the Garda than the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; to stop zero tolerance in the west.  I hope legislation to regulate pub licensing hours will be in place before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill. It is a decade since this House last moved to change the law regarding licensing hours.  In those ten years there has been a significant number of changes in the behaviour of the Irish drinking public, but the law has failed to take account of them.  This Bill is a timely and comprehensive response to the public demand for reform of our licensing laws.</P>
      <P>The law as it currently stands has fallen into disrepute.  It is important that this House and the legislature responds to changes in society.  The failure to change our licensing laws has had serious repercussions.  The ongoing déba cle in Galway city because of the opening of nightclubs demonstrates this point.  A large amount of Garda time is invested in enforcing laws which the vast majority of people, especially the young, see as irrelevant.  This is not only a scandalous waste of Garda resources but is also extremely damaging to their image in the city and serves no one's interest.</P>
      <P>In recent newspaper reports the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, expressed his concern at the ongoing situation in the City of the Tribes.  He expressed his wish that the law be changed before the summer.  However, in the recently published list of proposed legislation, there is no mention of updating our licensing laws.  It is obvious all members of the Government are not singing from the same hymn sheet.  If it chooses to vote down this Bill this evening, I fear the internal division will lead to further paralysis and nothing of substance will be produced.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Upton is comprehensive and well-researched.  It strikes an important balance between the rights of the consumer and the rights of staff working in the industry. Consumers have a right to choice in the marketplace and workers have a right to refuse to work longer hours if they wish.  The Bill takes account of these principles.</P>
      <P>The proposal to eliminate the distinction between winter and summer time opening hours is long overdue.  The reason for this distinction has always evaded me and it is time this absurdity was removed from the Statute Book.  I am in favour of the general extension of pub opening hours until 12.30 a.m. This proposal takes account of the changing face of Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> As a Kildare representative, I have seen the expansion of employment in that county in recent years.  Many of the companies which have recently located in Ireland are hi-tech industries which operate shift systems.  It is abundantly clear that the traditional nine-to-five working structure is no longer relevant to many of our workers, particularly young workers.  It is common for people to work shifts which finish at nine or ten o'clock in the evening.  The proposed change in the law will enable these people to have a drink with their colleagues when they finish work.  It will remove the necessity to rush out to a pub and stockpile drink as the clock ticks towards 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The proposed change will also serve the interests of our expanding tourism industry. Tourists, particularly those from the Continent whom Bord Fáilte have encouraged to visit our shores, are often bemused at our archaic licensing laws.  It is time we moved to bring our laws into line with the practice in continental Europe.  This Bill will achieve that.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides a new and important facility for local communities to petition the courts to restrict the opening hours of a public house.  This is important for residents whose peace and quiet is consistently interrupted by pub customers behaving in a loud and disruptive manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to abolish the Sunday closing requirement placed on some pubs.  This is another legislative anomaly which borders on the farcical.  In recent years there has been a huge expansion in the number of people who enjoy going to a pub on Sunday afternoon to watch sporting events.  That citizens are forced to watch these events behind locked doors, in fear of a visit from the local constabulary, is a farce and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>However, it is not only people who want to watch televised sporting events who suffer because of the law as it currently stands.  Many sports fans who attend Croke Park for a big match are amazed that pubs in the vicinity of the ground are legally obliged to close at 2 p.m. This is extremely inconvenient, particularly for people who may have travelled to the match without a ticket to sample the atmosphere.  They are left to roam the streets in search of a hotel bar which may allow them in to see the game.</P>
    <P>The Bill also protects bar staff from being obliged to work extra hours.  I support this important part of the Bill and I commend this Bill to the House.  It will not increase the incidence of alcoholism or the amount of drink consumed. There is hardly a family which has not been touched by the tragedy of alcoholism in some way.  If I or my party felt this Bill would exacerbate this huge problem we would not have introduced it.  However, we are concerned that the legislation enacted by this House reflects the needs and habits of our citizens.  Our licensing laws have been neglected for too long.  They have fallen into disrepute.  The Bill would remedy this <Col N="1563" /> and provide a sound and relevant basis for the licensed trade and the many thousands of jobs it creates and supports.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and commend my colleague, Deputy Upton, on introducing it.  I had the unspeakable pleasure in the last Dáil to serve on the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and on its subcommittee which dealt with this issue over a period of about one year.  It was, in a strange way, an unusual experience.</P>
      <P>This is one of those issues which transcends party boundaries.  To the best of my knowledge, apart from the Labour Party, there is no party which has a specific policy on the extension of closing times.  The members of the subcommittee, therefore, felt a certain liberty in expressing their views.  It is clear that there was no conformity between the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party members of the group.  In so far as there was a clear distinction between members it was between those who represented the bigger cities, Dublin and Cork and, to some extent, Galway and Limerick where generally the licensing laws are enforced relatively strictly, and those who represented areas of the country where the laws are treated in a slightly more liberal or lax fashion.  Many of the members who represented rural constituencies took the view that this was not particularly relevant to them since they or many of their constituents could doubtless find a public house somewhere in their town or village which was prepared to stay open and offer them a late night pint.  This was a source of frustration.</P>
      <P>Saving the interests of night club owners in Galway, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Garda Síochána for what they have decided to do in the west.  In enforcing the licensing laws in western counties they have brought to a head an issue which might otherwise have glided past us.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; we were told this explicitly at the time by officials of the Department; I commend them for their honesty and frankness &mdash; has much on its plate when it came to the criminal law as can be seen from the volume of legislation it has generated in the past two years.  Regulating pub opening hours will not happen unless the Government as a matter of priority decides to make it happen.</P>
      <P>In looking at the licensing laws it struck me that they are very detailed and arcane.  It is difficult to come to grips with them.  In framing the Bill we have selected the highlights, the laws of most concern to people.  I commend this approach to the Minister and the Department should they, as I hope they will, choose to look at this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about ten years since the then Minister, Gerry Collins, introduced some relatively modest changes to the licensing laws.  They were motivated by a recognition of the changes then occurring in society.  They were condemned by many as a fundamental change and something that would <Col N="1564" /> challenge family life, encourage drunkenness and so on but they did not.  No one was immune to the argument that in extending drinking hours by more than one hour one could conceivably encourage greater drunkenness or, more serious, alcoholism.</P>
    <P>During the course of the subcommittee's deliberations we received a report published by the Department of Health and Children on the abuse of alcohol in Ireland.  What was most striking about that report was that it established that there was a serious lack of literature on alcoholism here and on public houses and alcoholism. That may sound simplistic but it is not.</P>
    <P>Most of us engage in the activity of stacking up at closing time.  This is, to say the least, unhealthy. We have all been in a public house at 11 p.m. during the winter or 11.30 p.m. during the summer when people buy two or three pints, line them up in front of them and frequently drink them much more quickly than they should. Everybody then tumbles out half cut on to the streets at exactly the same time.  At that stage of the evening, apart from the nitelink buses, public transport in Dublin has to all extents and purposes ceased and there are queues for taxis with the attendant problems.  Everybody under the influence of drink arrives out on the streets at exactly the same time.  This causes a certain measure of civil disorder among people who are predisposed to be disorderly.  What merit can there be in doing it that way?</P>
    <P>There is a need for a careful study of alcoholism. All the studies clearly show that people do not become alcoholics by drinking lager, it is much more likely that they will do so if they abuse spirits.  Alcoholics will find a means and a place to consume alcohol.  Alcoholism is a state of mind, it is a disease.  It is not something that necessarily will be encouraged by an extra hour's drinking time in the evening.</P>
    <P>We need to look at this as a matter of consumer choice.  There is no doubt there is a considerable public demand and an unanswerable case for the extension of opening hours and standardisation of the laws as they apply to various types of licensed premises.  I will return to this later.  If I had my way, I would engage in much greater deregulation than that proposed in the Bill.  I suspect Deputy Upton might do the same.  I do not see why the State should impose a uniform closing time, even 12.30 a.m., throughout the State.  My preference would be to allow an authority, be it a licensing authority, the courts or a local authority, to decide whether a particular premises should be allowed to stay open until a particular time.  Different restrictions should be imposed on a public house in a residential area and in the city centre.  We should develop an authority which is capable of doing this.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws bear no relationship to what the consumer wants.  As we are all aware, tourists and people living here want to go out on Fridays and Saturdays and sometimes Thursdays and Sundays.  Frequently they go out late, particularly <Col N="1565" /> during the summer.  They are entitled to do so. People in our profession frequently attend meetings during the week which last until 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. Why should we be allowed 30 minutes or an hour's drinking time when we finish? People who work late at night, even later than we do, are just as entitled to enjoy a social drink or two after they finish work as anybody else.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws are entirely anachronistic. They date back to Victorian times.  Our then colonial masters formed the view that the Irish could not be trusted to drink sensibly and that the only solution was to cap the number of licences and impose a range of restrictions on when and where we could drink.  Clearly, the demands of Victorian times were quite different to the demands of Ireland of the 1990s.  We also know that, in so far as they were attempting to prevent alcoholism and drunkenness among the Irish, the Victorians were less than successful.  The evidence in countries such as Scotland and New Zealand where they have liberalised the licensing laws and moved in the opposite direction is that it has not led to increased drunkenness or increased alcoholism, rather it has had the effect of promoting a more mature and civilised approach to alcohol consumption.</P>
    <P>To leave the licensing laws unchanged in essence would be a contempt for those of us who like to have a late night drink in a mature and responsible way.  It was said at the annual conference of the Irish Vintners' Association last week that people visiting public houses should no longer be treated like children, that &ldquo;they must be treated like the responsible adults that they are&rdquo;.  During the deliberations of the subcommittee I remember receiving a letter from a licensed premises in Galway in which it was stated that it was very difficult to explain to customers, grown adults, that they were required to go home at a point in the evening when their teenage children were going out to discos.  That says it all in a concise and clear way.</P>
    <P>As they currently stand, the licensing laws pose serious problems for publicans.  Publicans often find themselves attempting, on the one hand, to satisfy the needs and demands of their customers and, on the other, to act within the law.  The Bill adequately addresses publicans' concerns by extending opening hours.  It is difficult for the Garda Síochána to enforce the law.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Wall, that it is, quite frankly, a waste of Garda time.  The law is in disrepute. It is impossible to continue to enforce it when most people do not regard it as a serious law in the first place.  Most people do not accept they are committing a criminal offence by having a drink at 11.30 in the evening, and why on earth should they?</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to standardise winter and summer licensing hours.  I am at a complete loss to understand why the distinction was ever made. We should rectify that anomaly.</P>
    <P>The provisions that currently exist in the licensing code for granting special exemptions clearly <Col N="1566" /> undermine any principled objection to the extension of the present licensing laws.  The fact that there are over 60,000 applications for exemptions and bar extensions every year makes a mockery of the current law and provides us with yet another convincing argument in favour of extending licensing hours.  We would be hard pressed to find another law which requires so many exemptions.</P>
    <P>The position on Saturday night is particularly anomalous.  Many people who frequent night clubs would be bemused to find out what the law actually states.  It requires pubs or night clubs to close and stop serving drink at midnight on Saturday because it is not possible to obtain an extension into Sunday &mdash; the Lord's Day, the Sabbath. Likewise, on Sunday evening it is not possible to get an extension between 11 and 12 o'clock. Extensions on Sunday can only start at midnight. This is farcical and we all know that in most cases it is not observed, except currently in Galway, unfortunately for them.</P>
    <P>The need for change is obvious given our improving tourism industry and that is nowhere more evident than in Dublin where tourists are frequently bemused to find they are being thrown out of pubs at a relatively early stage of a night out.  I had the good fortune to be on a private holiday in New York for a few days around St. Patrick's Day.  I would have been astonished, as I am sure anyone else would, had I been asked at 11 o'clock at night to vacate the premises and return to my hotel.  When one goes on holidays, to a city in particular, for a short break &mdash; and many people are coming to Dublin for short city breaks at the moment &mdash; one expects to be able to get a bit of night life and have a few pints late in the evening.</P>
    <P>The whole issue is bedevilled by vested interests.  Many of those vested interests are seeking to maintain a differential between themselves and other providers of drink.  Publicans have different interests to night club owners and hoteliers.</P>
    <P>I was struck by one argument that we could not possibly allow pubs to open late because it would reduce business in local hotels.  I told the Deputy who made the suggestion that &mdash; assuming there was an hotel where I was drinking, which there is not &mdash; I did not see why someone like me, who just wanted a quiet pint at midnight, should be forced to court the company of teenagers pushing and shoving their way through a disco and pay over the odds for a pint in a plastic cup.  The point did not appear to be taken, but the fact is that many of us just want a pint late at night in our local pub.  We do not want the benefit of music or singing, nor do we want to be pushed and shoved around by young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses the issue of the holy hour on Sunday when licensed premises close from 2 to 4 o'clock.  I confess I forgot to pay my Sky sports subscription last month and I have not yet been reconnected.  The point is not entirely frivolous because many people go into pubs to <Col N="1567" /> watch matches &mdash; frequently British soccer, but also domestic games &mdash; on Sunday afternoons.  It is only right and proper that they should be allowed to enjoy themselves and have a pint while doing so.  What possible good can be served by the licensing code preventing people from doing that?  What good can be served, for example, by stopping people going out for lunch in the local pub on a Sunday and staying on for a pint or two afterwards?  What good can be served by preventing tourists from doing the same?</P>
    <P>The existence of the holy hour is clearly an anomaly and has to go.  The same also applies to Good Friday.  In this party, as elsewhere, we are conscious that Good Friday is a special day for many people.  They want to observe it religiously as they have done in the past.  They are absolutely entitled to do so, but there is no longer any reason, in the 1990s, why we require the licensing code or statute law to enforce religious observance. If people do not want to have a pint or go shopping on that day then they are at liberty to refrain from doing so.  There is no good reason why, however, on a major bank holiday weekend when many tourists are about, we should oblige those who do not want to observe in that way to do so.</P>
    <P>We could spend the rest of the evening debating the issue of restaurant licences because the greatest abuse and difficulty has been in that area.  The restaurant licence is too expensive for genuine restaurants and we should reduce the price.  I am conscious that defining a genuine restaurant is not easy and the Garda Síochána has had some difficulty in enforcing this aspect of the licensing laws.  However, in so far as we can define it we should seek to reduce the price and should allow most if not all restaurants that want to do so to serve drink beyond 12.30 a.m., which is the current limit.</P>
    <P>We must, however, confront the farce that if one serves some sort of food during the day in a pub, one will in some cases be entitled to stay open longer at night.  The truth is that this matter is almost entirely at the discretion of the local Garda superintendent, who have taken differing views on the issue depending on which parts of the city they work in.  The lack of consistency is farcical and has brought the law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The availability of licences is another big issue. Providing a licence was always intended simply to give someone permission to serve alcoholic drink. In the same way as taxi licences, it was never intended to convey or sell something that would have an intrinsic value in itself, yet that has clearly happened.  We are left in the absurd situation where in very small villages one will find a dozen or more licences, whereas in some huge suburbs of Dublin one finds only one or two licences.  It is almost impossible to increase the number of licences, which leaves us in the obscene situation where one ends up with huge boozeramas which nobody would choose to frequent <Col N="1568" /> if there were any alternative.  In many cases, however, there is none.</P>
    <P>This is a major area of the law and I have touched on just some of the issues that arise.  The Bill deals with only the most important issues which will impact immediately on the maximum number of people.  I commend that approach to the Department if it is minded to do something in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this Bill introduced by Deputy Upton, although I do not want to give the impression that I am against change. The main provisions in the Bill would be to extend opening hours to 12.30 a.m. and to abolish Sunday closing between 2 and 4 p.m. The existing Sunday opening hours would be replaced with weekday opening times as well as permitting public houses and clubs to open on Good Friday.  Any revision of the existing legislation needs to take on board the views of all interested groups, including MANDATE, the union that represents workers in the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>I met the secretary of that union, Mr. Jim Moloney, who represents these workers.  A previous speaker said the matter had been well researched but Mr. Moloney informed me that no consultation took place with his union and no research was carried out.  His union membership is opposed to the proposed changes.  He also pointed out, and I agree with him, that there is a need to give serious consideration to the social and economic implications of extended opening hours.  He says, for example, that it would cause hardship for the workforce and break up the fabric of family life.  The standard of professionalism in the trade would be reduced due to casualisation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell said that tourists are demanding longer opening hours like those in other countries.  The business currently trades for 13 hours which is more than adequate.  In addition, customers have only so much disposable income to spend.  Research has also established that there is no demand from tourists for extended hours and this can be confirmed by Bord Fáilte.  It is also a fact that workers are leaving the trade due to unsocial hours as they have become strangers in their homes.</P>
      <P>A sizeable number of publicans are not enamoured of these proposals.  They believe that opening on a Good Friday would create mayhem as it is a day respected by all Christians throughout Europe.  Spain and Germany are the only countries which have more trading hours than Ireland, while Northern Ireland and Britain have fewer trading hours.  The union believes it would also contribute to the black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> There are provisions in the Bill to protect the rights of workers.  The union pointed out that Deputy Upton proposed that workers who work overtime should get time and a half.  I remind him that five years ago the union successfully negotiated to give the workers double time.  I do not have much regard for his research given that he does not know what conditions the workers already have.  The provisions in this Bill would worsen their conditions.  I am surprised the Labour Party, which purports to be the conscience of the workers, introduced such a Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is jumping the gun.  He must be aware that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security was engaged in a broad review of the licensing laws when the 27th Dáil was dissolved. That work is continuing under the sub-committee of the new Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.  It is premature, therefore, to introduce legislation in advance of that review and without considering the recommendations of the select committee which is engaged in consultations with interested parties.  That is the appropriate way forward.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputy to consider if this is the appropriate time to introduce the Bill.  I would like to have the recommendations of the committee to hand before attempting to amend existing legislation. We should also consult interested parties, such as the workers and the unions which represent them to find out their views and how they believe it would affect their members.  I am against anything which worsens their conditions.</P>
    <P>There would be a need for consultation even after considering the select committee's recommendations. We made this mistake before when we introduced regulations for the taxi industry without consulting the associations which represented taxi and hackney owners.  We created chaos in that industry as a result of not consulting people who knew the business.  I ask Deputy Upton to wait until the report of the select committee is available.  Everyone would then be able to have an input, particularly MANDATE and Mr. Jim Moloney.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton said he consulted widely. However, Mr. Jim Moloney told me that no one consulted his union or the publicans.</P>

      <P>I have known the man a long time and I must believe what he tells me.  He also believes it will increase antisocial behaviour. Many public houses, particularly in the suburbs of Dublin, are located in residential areas.  I receive a huge number of complaints from residents in my constituency about noise at 12.30 a.m. and 1 a.m. If a pub was open to 12.30 a.m., people would not leave it until 1.15 a.m. and residents would not be able to get up for work the next day.  At present, the workforce does not get home until 1.30 a.m. The union points out that if this <Col N="1570" /> legislation is passed, workers will probably not get home until 2.30 a.m. I ask Deputy Upton to reconsider his proposal.</P>

      <P>Any debate on the licensing laws will provoke a wide-ranging debate.  While it was not wise of Deputy Upton to introduce this Bill, I compliment him for affording us the opportunity to have a national debate on the issue. However, it is a pity the Deputy did not wait for the outcome of the wide-ranging review by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.  One wonders what importance the parties in this House attach to such committees.</P>
      <P>I did some research on this issue and I found a variety of conflicting opinions.  At the vintners' conference in Tralee last weekend, it was suggested that customers should be treated with more respect.  However, where is the respect in shouting &ldquo;time please&rdquo; only an hour after people have come out for the evening?  On the one hand, proprietors of licensed premises advocate wide-ranging flexibility and review of the laws, while, on the other hand, MANDATE urges caution.  I agree with MANDATE's advice.</P>
      <P>Those of us who represent constituencies where many licensed premises are in built up areas have experienced high levels of antisocial behaviour and rowdy activity outside public houses at night.  As someone from a teaching background, I have salutary experience of seeing children coming into school extremely tired because in some cases their parents have been allowed to stay in a pub in a quiet neighbourhood area until the early hours of the morning.  That is a flagrant breach of the laws.  I have also seen older students with hangovers coming into school to sit State examinations.  Anyone involved with youth and community work should caution against such activity.</P>
      <P>I concur with MANDATE'S comments that longer opening hours would have a devastating effect on working conditions in the licensed trade and a huge negative impact on a wide range of social issues.  I do not like suggesting that anyone would introduce a Bill as a public relations exercise. Unfortunately Deputy Upton's Bill smacks of that.  Any extension of licensing hours must be carefully considered.  I have an open mind on some flexibility in the Dublin area.  Many licensed premises do not close between 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Sundays because they serve food.  That makes a laugh of the legislation which provides that they should be closed and this area needs to be reviewed.  There is an annual call for licensed premises to open on Good Friday.  I also have an open mind on that, but I am not persuaded of the need for them to open on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> Longer opening hours will have an impact on the employment of bar staff and licensed premises staff.  It is becoming more difficult to attract young people into bar apprenticeships and there is evidence of increased casualisation in the licensed trade, which is regrettable.  The bar apprentice trade was one to which young people aspired and could derive considerable income. Recently MANDATE stated that many bar staff are voting with their feet.  Because they are required to work such long hours it is not worth their while taking such employment.  I expressed reservations in this House about allowing betting shops to remain open late.  The dangers incurred by many bar staff in our troubled society is worrying and I do not want to place members of any profession or trade at undue risk.</P>
    <P>The seminar organised jointly by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Dublin Institute of Technology which is due to take place in the Gresham Hotel on Friday will contribute greatly to this debate.  I am impressed by the range of views it is seeking.  The views of the Competition Authority, the licensed trade and the tourism industry are being sought and that is valuable.  Other jurisdictions have broadened their approach to the licensing laws in recent years.  I note that one of the speakers is from the liquor licensing commission in Victoria, Australia.  It is important that there will be a spread of expertise at the seminar.  For example, Ken Barry, Director of the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research at the University of Paisley in Scotland, is due to attend and he will give his opinion on this matter.</P>
    <P>Some of us are concerned because there is an inclination to glorify the notion of alcohol consumption when it contributes to a great deal of pain, hurt and trouble in our society.  There was a spate of fatal road traffic accidents in the past year and the number in the most recent months has been extremely worrying.  Research evidence suggests there is a fairly direct link between the high rate of road accidents and high alcohol consumption. Many of the accidents occur in the early hours of the morning.  Putting two and two together is often a dangerous exercise, but if nightclubs and late drinking pubs close at 1.30 a.m. or 2 a.m. and accidents occur on lonely roads or motorways at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., one inevitably comes to the conclusion that there must be some link between people drinking late and people driving fast.  That is a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>I am also extremely concerned about the exploitation of young people and I voiced my opinion on this elsewhere.  We have great difficulty in enforcing the laws governing the employment of young people as part-time workers whether in supermarkets or the licensed trade.  I worry about the impact on young people and their families if, as inevitably will happen, many of them are forced to work later and later hours. They will not be able to attend school next morning or if they are able to turn up they will be <Col N="1572" /> incapable of putting in a good day's work and that will have a major impact on their performance in State examinations.  I do not want to be too pessimistic about this, but the impact that the attraction of opportunities to drink late at night will have on young people attending primary schools also worries me.  It is for that reason I caution against rushing through this Bill.  We should have a well thought out debate on this matter because it is not straightforward.  Issues such as the price of non-alcoholic drinks and the abuse of bar extensions by football and sporting clubs need to be explored in such a debate and other issues also need to be ventilated.  While I compliment Deputy Upton on producing this Bill which has presented a valuable opportunity to debate this issue, I cannot support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill.  Like other speakers I do not disagree with it on the basis of its content, but on the basis of the methodology used in its production.  Debate took place over a good many years on the best method of ensuring the most productive and beneficial use of the time available to Members of the House and the use of the general facilities and during the lifetime of the 27th Dáil and this Dáil a new system was put in place.  The system is based on the existence of a series of working committees related as far as possible to each ministerial portfolio.  Each has secretarial support and wide-ranging rights regarding the collection of information and views of different interest groups and so on.  They are becoming more effective as people begin to realise the benefits of the system.  The potential for the production by these all-party committees of well researched and well debated reports and recommendations is enormous, but they can be time consuming for Deputies who wish to give them their full commitment.  Members here are aware of the amount of time issues under discussion can absorb at those committees, but I believe they are worth the effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main argument put forward against these committees when they were first mooted was that a member might leak major stories from them while issues were under consideration or, as I believe we are witnessing here, a member might make a solo run on whatever issue was the topic of debate before the committee.  I strongly believe and am concerned that if that were to happen a few times it would greatly undermine the credibility of the system.  Deputies and others would legitimately question why they should spend hours week after week at committees discussing some issue or carrying out research on them to find that some other member has made a pre-emptive strike on the issue.  I have debated this issue at local Government level and in the Dáil. I may have spent too long on this matter, but it is one about which I am genuinely concerned.  A committee of the House is doing work on this matter at present.  An enormous amount of work has been and is being done on this issue.  It is wrong that somebody should make a pre-emptive <Col N="1573" /> strike, irrespective of the justification put forward.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a need for changes in the licensing laws.  We will almost certainly make changes when the committee involved reports back to the House.  I am not a member of that committee or a party to its findings to date.</P>
    <P>However, we also need to recognise that the greatest drug abuse involves alcohol and that has been the case for many years.  We need to recognise the number of people who have ended up in psychiatric institutions because of alcohol abuse. We need to accept the influence of drink in many road accidents, as Deputy Pat Carey mentioned. We need to recognise the part that alcohol abuse plays in domestic violence and hardship.</P>
    <P>The only way we can take proper account of all of those issues and still allow for the normal and legitimate enjoyment which the vast majority of us take from the consumption of alcohol is by working in a reasoned fashion with all of the aspects, the difficulties and the issues before us. We should not just pick out one item in isolation.</P>
    <P>Our style of social living for generations has centred around gathering in houses and people having a drink, a game of cards or a chat.  That has now moved into the local hostelry and so be it.  That is the choice of people and I have no problem with it.  We need to reflect the needs of tourism, but I do not believe that sector is clamouring for extended hours.</P>
    <P>I, as somebody who at a function or otherwise is often around at closing time, am extremely worried about the stampede to the bar at 10.55 p.m. or 11.25 p.m., as the case may be at different times of the year.  The fact that people are buying drinks and consuming them quickly in the last half hour is the cause of much drunkenness.  It is an issue which must be looked at and dealt with, as I said, in a reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>If we extend the hours &mdash; it is quite likely the committee will recommend that in time &mdash; one must look at the availability of some kind of public transport at night.  One cannot just leave it as it is.  We have heard about the situation in Dublin after clubs close.  People tell us there are no taxis and they cannot get home.  At Christmas publicans organise transport home for people, but if pubs remain open until 1 a.m., I cannot see them co-operating in the same way.</P>
    <P>I see the farcical situation that at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. what are classed as the responsible adults in society are sent home &mdash; they have had enough to drink &mdash; yet the young people move into the nearest disco or nightclub and stay until 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried by the reaction of MANDATE but I recognise where it is coming from.  It has had problems with the exploitation of young people and it has voiced this consistently over the years.  There is a fear that if the hours are extended, young people will be used to gather the glasses or to do the lesser jobs for which they are given a few pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The average bartender works a long day.  It is not a well paid job and that needs to be address. People will say to me that is another issue which must be dealt with separately, but if we are introducing legislation we need to look at the effects across the board.  I know Deputy Upton has attempted to address the question of hours, etc., but it would not appear that what he has put forward is widely accepted.  It needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am totally against the Bill.  I must confess it would not matter to what the Bill related.  People talk about PR and speaking in public, but as a person who does a good deal of work in committees, both here and at local level, I disagree totally with somebody taking out of committee an issue which is under debate.</P>
    <P>Although I am against this Bill, I believe we need to look at the issue.  It is topical.  It relates to so many aspects of society that we need to examine it.  It is approximately ten years since the last review.  At that stage, unfortunately, many of the clubs which were social centres, GAA clubs, etc., suffered from the advertising changes which were introduced.  Many of them closed down.</P>
    <P>It is time for change.  When the committee tables its recommendations, I hope Deputy Upton will support them and merge his recommendations with them.  In the meantime, I am against this Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill because it attempts to remove outdated and paternalistic controls on adult behaviour which are very worthy in their intent but which have actually worked against achieving their original purpose.  I presume that limited opening hours set out to limit the consumption of alcohol, but early closing has actually increased the pace of consumption as drinkers, myself and all of us included, seek to maximise the intake in the last hour before closing. We are forced by rules, which do not seem to have any relevance anymore, to become obsessive, frantic, irrational imbibers just as the witching hour of closing approaches.  Removing these ridiculous constraints would lead to a far more relaxed approach to drink and a far more responsible attitude.</P>
      <P>There is a valid view, or at least a view which I would take on board, that more relaxed drinking laws would have an impact on families where there is an alcoholic member.  It is a view with which I would have sympathy.  However, one cannot legislate for obsessive behaviour. Shorter opening hours for pubs will not cure alcoholics, but a more relaxed approach by the majority of drinkers generally could help prevent alcoholism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputies earlier about the need to facilitate shift-workers are valid.  They are entitled to have their enjoyment the same as the <Col N="1575" /> rest of us, and to relax over a drink.  The point made about the need to facilitate tourists, who are truly astonished by our drinking laws, is also valid.  After all, tourism is now our biggest industry. It is a growing industry and we cannot ignore it.</P>
    <P>Listening to Government Deputies it is worth reminding people yet again that when one introduces legislation which makes regulation more flexible, it is a system which is not mandatory. Pubs are not obliged to stay open all of these hours.  It is about introducing flexibility and giving people the choice to stay and have a relaxing drink in the local pub if one wants to drink late at night rather than, as Deputy McDowell stated, being forced into much overpriced clubs.</P>
    <P>I know bar workers have fears about this, but that is a red herring.  If bar workers must work longer hours or unsocial hours, of course they must be remunerated for it.  There are laws which limit the number of hours which a person, particularly a young person, may work.  If they are not being enforced, they should be.</P>
    <P>There is another related aspect to this topic which I also want to raise, the problem of underage drinking, and this Bill may have a role to play in solving it.  As a society, we show a totally unacceptable ambivalence to it.  It is completely and utterly unacceptable to have young children drinking alcohol.  Certainly, it is unacceptable to have them doing so without the supervision of adults.  Recent figures published only last week show that three-quarters of teenagers between 12 and 18 &mdash; there are 400,000 of them &mdash; are drinking alcohol regularly.  An alcohol counsellor working with alcohol abusers maintains that the average age of those he is treating has fallen in the past ten years from 35 to 17 years.  That is a frightening figure.  I am not suggesting that all young people who drink alcohol underage become addicted, but a healthy adolescence and alcohol consumption are not compatible and should not be tolerated.  We owe it to our young people to ensure we as a society do everything to prevent alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>In urban Ireland, particularly Dublin, teenage drinking takes place on an unbelievable scale in open spaces, laneways and parks.  It is an increasing phenomenon, the new urban youth culture, and it is frightening in its extent.</P>
    <P>Public representatives will be aware of complaints relating to this practice, about local nuisance to residents, litter and petty vandalism, but for the teenagers involved the effects are much more deleterious.  It is in those places that young people learn about drugs and many teenage pregnancies start.  There is a general disconnection and disaffection among our young people with society in general.  Alcohol abuse is bad for children and society and we should do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting this problem can be solved by legislation.  Parents have a huge role to play, but many of them do not play a responsible role. <Col N="1576" /> The provision of funding for recreational and sporting facilities is important.  There are many underlying causes of underage drinking.  Social disadvantage is often quoted as one cause, but it is not the whole story.  In my constituency most of the young people who are drinking and taking drugs are not disadvantaged children.  They know better, they have money and alternatives, but yet they choose this as a way of life.  The real problem relates to attitude and culture, and young people follow our attitudes and culture.  Legislation changes attitudes, as we have seen with the drink-driving laws, as a result of which that practice is no longer acceptable.  That is one Bill that has worked and perhaps this one will work too.</P>
    <P>There is legislation to prohibit underage drinking, but it is unenforceable at sales outlets and where the drinking takes place.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised last October to bring in a voluntary system of national identity cards, but I have heard nothing about it since.  I ask the Minister to pass on my request to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reconsider a mandatory system of national identity cards.  Nothing else will work because society is too complex and sophisticated. A voluntary system would not work because our young people are too smart.  The position has deteriorated to the point where the nettle must be grasped in terms of a national identity card system.  Laws that cannot be enforced are not only useless but damaging because they encourage the behaviour they are designed to prevent.  I am not a prude or a killjoy, but if we do not take this problem seriously we will allow this generation to destroy themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill will result in a more relaxed and sensible approach to drinking habits, which will improve society not only for ourselves, tourists, shift workers and so on, but particularly for our children who, I hope, will adopt a different attitude to drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I like and respect Deputy Upton, but I stare in amazement at this Bill and I do not intend to support it.  I have very strong views on the tragedy of drink.  I view with cynicism the complete neglect by all Governments, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, of the damage the drink industry is doing to the country.  Comparisons with European countries are invidious.  Our problem is that we have a problem with drink. Whatever is in our genes, it affects us severely. There is not a family that has not suffered from the ravages of drink.  The saddest aspect is the damage done to the youth and women who sat on bar room stools about 30 years ago.  The fastest rising statistic in psychiatric terms is the number of women who seek admission to psychiatric units as a result of drink abuse.  We pontificate with regularity about the horrors of the cigarette industry.  I do not advocate that anybody should smoke but we turn a blind eye to the ravages imposed on society by the drink industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday last a girl of 22 years attended my <Col N="1577" /> clinic.  She has four children by four different fathers and the four contacts were made in a pub. Some young men spend their wages getting girls into a position where they destroy their lives and then walk away.  Society must face up to the problem of drink.  There is no room for ambivalence. We feign outrage about the drugs industry and the amount of damage it does to society, but the drug that causes the greatest problem is alcohol. A man who smokes himself to death does not starve his family by denying them money.  The damage done to families by drink is incalculable. Yet, Governments ignore this problem because of the power of the vintners' industry, the most lucrative business in Ireland where millions of pounds change hands.  At their delegate conference in Wexford yesterday a client requested State aid to refurbish his premises.  Those people want grants and subsidies, yet 88 per cent of vintners spent £200 million, money taken from the backs of unfortunate wrecks in society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about adult drinkers. Adult drinkers have a long road to go from the first day they are targeted by the drink industry. Young people are fed on a diet of television advertisements every ten minutes about Harp or Carlsberg, seductive bullshit advertisements showing a good looking woman or man in the pub.  Sex is used to sell drink to gullible young people at a vulnerable stage of their lives.  About 90 per cent of social problems are directly attributable to drink.  There has been an appalling increase in the break up of families and single parents, and that is attributable to the drink industry.  If a cash supplement was provided, the number would not increase as quickly.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the chief executive of the National Safety Council attributed the number of deaths on the roads to speed and drink, and he is right. In February of this year 730 people were injured and 30 killed on the roads.  In January, 739 were injured.  Therefore, almost 1,500 people were injured and 65 were killed in two months.  During the past fortnight, 24 people have been laid to rest.  How can a person who cannot walk a straight line be expected to drive a car?  Despite the best efforts of the police, thousands of people are continuing to drink and drive.  When the drink is in the wit is out.  Alcohol gives people false confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell advanced what I would, with respect, term a fanciful notion that if hours of opening are extended people would become relaxed because the their fear of the prospect of being denied alcohol would evaporate.  My colleague is a nice lady but her notion is too fanciful.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill for the sake of young people. I have consistently expressed my views on alcohol, particularly in contrast to the way in which we deal with the tobacco industry.  I want to illustrate the hypocrisy of successive Governments in homing in on the tobacco industry and turning a blind eye to the country's greatest problem, namely, the glorification and glamorisation of alcohol.  There is an increasing need to open <Col N="1578" /> additional psychiatric hospitals because of the excesses of alcohol.  I am not advocating prohibition but we have a definite weakness in respect of alcohol.  We do not savour or sip alcohol in the same way as people in England or on the Continent, we drink it like tea and the social consequences are appalling.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems faced by elderly people is the disco scene.  These establishments are unbelievable hellholes where rows often ensue.  Local newspapers carry continual reports of fights at discos which sometimes lead to fatalities. Young people drinking alcohol are like Indians who are given whiskey, they cannot handle it and they go bananas.  Rows and fights ensue in the darkness of the disco, accompanied by a thudding beat.  That is a world away from the days when the Minister of State and I attended dances.</P>
    <P>Most crime occurs in the early hours of the morning.  Vandalism is uncontrollable and occurs when these people, having imbibed hooch, are travelling home.  Some young people do not want the night to end.  A number of years ago there was a case of a judge who did not want the night to end and he drove in the direction of the Shelbourne Hotel desperately seeking a final gulp of alcohol.  If judges are doing this, the ordinary Joe Soap is also doing it.</P>
    <P>We should be less ambivalent in our attitude to alcohol and recognise it for what it is, namely, a serious drug.  Alcohol kills more people than heroin and it is peddled successfully by the vintners and the brewing industry.  Occasionally, these interests send money to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the relief of those unfortunate people who have fallen by the wayside.  I would like to see a more honest approach to the problems Irish people have with alcohol.  To advocate an extension of the hours of opening is madness and represents a recipe for increased disaster.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Olivia Mitchell and McGahon for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I acknowledge the work of Deputy Upton in bringing forward this Private Members' Bill.  It is important to debate this matter now, despite the fact that some Members believe Deputy Upton has &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; or is being &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo;. However, since we have the opportunity to debate this issue we should be serious about the way we intend to tackle it.  If Members oppose the Bill, they should do so because they do not agree with its contents rather than opposing it for political reasons.  This important Bill must be dealt with on a serious basis rather than Members opposing it merely for the sake of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a long and unproductive debate on this issue for the past ten years.  No one has grasped the nettle to settle this matter once and for all.  The opening hours that will emerge from the legislation to be drafted in due course must represent the final word in this area.  At present, a chaotic situation obtains in respect of licensing laws and opening hours.  We could use the excuse <Col N="1579" /> that tourists have demanded that opening hours here should be brought into line with those on the Continent.  However, we must not use any other group or state as a pawn when discussing difficulties in this country.</P>
    <P>It is unreal to expect the Garda Síochána to police the licensing laws because of the chaos that exists in respect of the variation in opening hours. The press and the media have highlighted the ludicrous situation which obtains in County Galway at present.  I do not know who took the initiative &mdash; perhaps it was a Garda superintendent or otherwise &mdash; but it was decided that the opening hours would be rigidly implemented and adhered to in County Galway.  I have no difficulty with gardaí carrying out such work if they are directed to do so.  However, it is laughable to suggest that they can rigidly implement opening hours in County Galway or Galway city when licensed premises in Portumna in County Tipperary can remain open as late as they wish because they are situated far away from a central Garda area such as Nenagh.  The situation is similar on the border between counties Limerick and Clare because the latter county has also been targeted in this regard.  I endeavoured to discover why County Galway was targeted but I could not do so.  I do not disagree with such action but it is disturbing that the opening hours are only implemented rigidly in certain areas.  For example, I could go out drinking until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. in Dublin if I knew the right place to be and no one would ask me to leave.  That is the reality of the situation.  The laws relating to opening hours must be regularised across the board.</P>
    <P>Last year, 65,000 exemptions were granted for a wide variety of reasons.  Sporting clubs, residents associations, political parties and other organisations all benefit in some way from extended opening hours in hotels, restaurants and social clubs.  We expect too much from the Garda Síochána in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to the problem of drinking and driving.  I hold a similar view.  We are requesting extended opening hours at a time when we will soon be asked to reduce the alcohol limits for driving.  There was absolute outrage expressed last week when Commissioner Kinnock, who has responsibility for this area under the Presidency of the EU, suggested that all EU countries incorporate an equal blood alcohol limit of 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  If this House followed that advice there would be uproar.  The lobby groups would put a great deal of pressure on us and we would be unable to resist that pressure, yet every one of us abhors the slaughter on our roads.</P>
    <P>Opening hours, with which this Bill deals, is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of this whole area.  We must introduce all-embracing legislation that will include the issue of licences and once and for all eliminate the scandal of exemptions. Why should a proprietor of one premises get an exemption and not another?  That problem has <Col N="1580" /> given rise to the concept of pub crawling.  The young people go from one licensed premises to another, depending on which pub has the extension.</P>
    <P>In regard to a case in Galway, did the Garda Síochána send trainee gardaí into discos in Galway city to get evidence to bring before the courts that the licensing laws were being broken and, consequently, deny the proprietors of those premises a licence?  The proprietors of those clubs cheated &mdash; as was expressed in the courts &mdash; by using a system which alerted them when the gardaí were about to raid their premises.  Everything would be in order when the gardaí arrived, but within five minutes of them leaving, the proprietors would reopen the shutters and sell drink late into the night.  The Garda must have had ample evidence on those nightclubs.  It was wrong to use trainee gardaí in that fashion.  It is similar to when the health boards sent children into shops to buy cigarettes to obtain a conviction against those shops in court.  It is beyond belief that young trainee gardaí were sent to discos to get evidence to bring to court.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed that counties Galway, Clare and Mayo have been targeted in terms of opening hours.  At whose behest is that operation being carried out?  Is that what zero tolerance means?  I shudder to think of the consequences if that is the way it is introduced in other areas.</P>
    <P>The obligations on a person who gets a licence must be seriously considered.  It should be stated in legislation that a person's licence will be revoked and the premises closed for a certain length of time if opening hours are violated or other unacceptable practices take place.  We need to regularise opening hours across the board so that premises on the same street do not have different opening hours.  That leads to chaos which cannot be controlled.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Upton on introducing a Private Members' Bill.  It is an achievement for any member of the Opposition to introduce such a Bill, regardless of whether the House agrees with its content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the lobby is coming from for this legislation.  While there has been a great deal of publicity in recent weeks about the problems being experienced in certain parts of the country in regard to opening hours, the only lobby of which I am aware is that from the vintners. In the run up to the general election I was not asked to change the pub closing hours.  Why is this issue getting so much attention?  Deputy McGahon rightly stated that the vintners are a strong and powerful lobby group.  Not for the first time I agree with a number of the comments he made sincerely and passionately.  Unlike him, however, I enjoy a drink and do not believe there <Col N="1581" /> is ever an appropriate time for a pub to close when one is out for a few drinks.  Deputy McGahon is a non-drinker and many of his comments were very valid.</P>
    <P>We are ambivalent about drinking.  We do not perceive the abuse of alcohol as substance abuse. When we refer to substance abuse we tend to refer to drugs, even though half of the audience at public meetings on drug abuse usually smoke cigarettes.  The amount of damage done by over-indulgence in alcohol is evident.  The Minister and Deputy McGahon mentioned that the incidence of violence against women and increases in violent crime as a result of excessive drinking have been noted in report after report.  The excuse of having had too much to drink is often used by people as a defence in court.  I am pleased that in the majority of cases judges have not accepted it.  However, there was a time when credence was given to the fact that someone behaved out of character or in an inappropriate fashion because they had had too much to drink, and that probably contributed to or was the result of our ambivalence to excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the question of changing pub opening hours.  We have seen, graphically and horrifically, the increase in deaths on our roads which has been attributed to excessive speed and to alcohol.  I would be concerned that any changes we make in the licensing laws to extend pub opening hours would lead to an increase in drink-driving offences.  The lack of public transport is a huge issue in terms of going for a drink.  If it is an issue in Dublin, it must be a much bigger issue outside Dublin.  The Taxi Drivers' Federation are looking for a huge fare increase.  They specifically mentioned Skerries.  Young people in Skerries, if they go out for a night, have to add £30 for a taxi to the cost of their night out, and taxi drivers were looking for an increase in levies imposed on persons going a certain distance outside the city.  Our public transport cannot cope with the ordinary demands on it at the moment.  As things stand, it certainly would not be able to respond to later pub closing times.</P>
    <P>The legislation relating to how late and how many hours young people can work has had an effect on young people working in pubs, but it is still an area in which students get part-time work to earn a few bob.  It would not be desirable for young people in second or third level education to find themselves cleaning up a pub at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. as distinct from 12.30 a.m. as they do at present.  It is an area of employment opportunity for young people, but an extension in pub opening hours would mean that they could not avail of it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of neighbourhood pubs.  There has been much comment about the situation in rural Ireland where the Garda Síochána are closing pubs early.  As a member of Dublin South County Council, Deputy Upton knows that the concept of neighbourhood pubs is one that the planners decided upon.  They decided <Col N="1582" /> that in a parish there would be the church, the school and a neighbourhood pub.  That has caused great difficulties for communities.  In builtup local authority and private housing estates, the neighbourhood pub was a focus of social life with people coming out of pubs in those areas late at night and causing major problems &mdash; Deputy McGahon referred to this in the context of night-clubs, etc.  If we have a planning concept in our local authorities that ensures that more and more neighbourhood pubs will be provided in growing parishes, late night drinking will cause more problems for communities in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with changing the licensing laws to allow pubs to stay open on Sundays because it is ludicrous that pubs should have to close from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. If that is still happening, and I am not sure it is, I support a change. Good Friday is one of two days on which pubs are not open, and I do not see the need to change that.</P>
    <P>Other contributors to the debate mentioned that visitors to our country see our licensing laws as archaic.  Visitors come to our country for the ceoil and the craic, but I do not know that they come to drink until all hours.  The way we drink is totally different from the way our European counterparts drink.  We seem to drink at a lunatic rate, and I would include myself in that, whereas continentals sit over one glass of beer or one coffee for an entire night.  I do not know if that would be a good reason to change the licensing hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he wants to look at this in a holistic way, to look at the pros and the cons.  I am not sure that we should change the legislation, but if we are to change it, we have to take account of both sides of the argument.  My gut instinct is that, even having received the report, we should tread warily on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGennis, Upton and Brady for sharing their time with me. I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to Deputy Upton's Bill.  While I agree that there is a need to change the licensing laws, Deputy Upton seems to have called &ldquo;time&rdquo; prematurely on this issue.  As the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights has been given the task of investigating all aspects of the current law, surely it should have been afforded the courtesy of being able to conclude its work, submit its recommendations and allowed time for those recommendations to be debated.  I understand that the Deputy put much work into the Bill, and I do not want to appear to be playing for time, but there is a report on its way which is only a month away.  Proper consultation with all concerned is vital.  I include in that not only those directly involved, the people who own and work in licensed premises, but also the statutory and voluntary groups, the general public and the Garda Síochána who will enforce the <Col N="1583" /> legislation, although they will not be the sole enforcers.</P>
      <P>The current laws include about 50 Acts dating from 1833 to 1997.  There is obviously a complex licensing code and complex body of legislation under which those with licensed premises operate. I doubt that the law is being fully implemented because the current legislation needs updating.  In his contribution the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, made a commitment to take the current review very seriously and said he was willing to deal with amending legislation.  His Department's involvement in a seminar on liquor licensing law reform to be held this Friday, 24 April is an example of the positive action in which he is currently engaged.</P>
      <P>Positive and informed action is needed.  Publicans and consumers alike are unhappy with the rules as they stand.  There are many anomalies in the laws and they are often difficult to enforce. The Garda Síochána are caught in the middle when they are expected to ensure that the law is enforced, while the mind set of consumers has moved on substantially to the stage where they, as consumers, feel it is unfair to be hounded out of a premises before midnight.  Ideally the compromise resolution of the current review will lead to a more workable legislative framework. Within the context of newly amended legislation it would be important, however, that the owner of the premises would take responsibility in the enforcing of the law.</P>
      <P>Within the setting of this Bill, I am not convinced that there is a great demand in rural areas for extended opening hours on weekdays.  Policing of many rural premises or the surrounding environment is not an issue owing to the generally quiet nature of the business from Monday to Thursday.  Perhaps the report from the committee will suggest varied recommendations for city versus countryside.  I would be happy to leave that to the experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking at the concept of opening on Good Friday, there could be substantial objections, if not hostility, to this from many perspectives. Within the context of this debate I would also be concerned that the fringe elements associated with alcohol should be looked at.  There is no doubt that the country has a public that enjoys alcohol consumption.  I include myself in this.  We are renowned for many of our alcohol products, many of which I would endorse.  However, there are also serious alcohol related difficulties in homes.  Thankfully, I do not have to include myself in that.  It could be argued that these problems will not necessarily be alleviated or made substantially worse by alterations to opening hours, but they are in need of attention as much as the current laws.  One such issue which has been addressed previously is underage drinking. A recent newspaper article indicated that three-quarters of teenagers between 12 and 18 years drink.  Another startling statistic is that the average <Col N="1584" /> age of people being treated for alcohol addiction had dropped from 35 to 17 years since the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the Garda among secondary school pupils and alcohol and drugs in Inishowen made striking reading.  I compliment those who were involved in the initiative which brought about the study.  I do not say that Donegal people are worse than others.  The issue of drugs is often highlighted but a similar level of concern is not expressed about the use of alcohol which is an equally addictive and potentially dangerous substance.</P>
    <P>The study asked children when they took their first full alcoholic drink: 35 per cent had it at 15 years of age, 4 per cent had it at 12 years old, 11 per cent at 13 years, 22 per cent at 14 years and only 8 per cent at 17 years.  When asked with whom they normally drink, 67 per cent responded that they drank with friends and very few drank at home with their parents.  When asked how often they drank in the past year 29.5 per cent replied between two and three times a month.  Let us remember we are talking about secondary school children who are not of legal age to drink.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question about the number of drinks taken at a time, 15 per cent said they would have six or more drinks when they were out, 18 per cent would have three and very few would take only one or two.  When asked in the survey where they got the drink 55 per cent said they got it in the disco, 32 per cent in a pub, 18 per cent from friends and 20 per cent from the off licence.  When asked where they drink currently, 55.5 per cent replied they drank in the disco, 26 per cent in the pubs and 13 per cent in a friend's home.</P>
    <P>Measures need to be taken to combat underage drinking and I am glad the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has been involved in bringing a focus to bear on this issue with the launch of the national alcohol awareness campaign. In the past strong advertising has had a positive impact on drink driving and the Minister's campaign message, &ldquo;Control your drinking before it controls you&rdquo;, should give food for thought.  The reasons young people are drinking and the manner in which they gain access to drink need to be pursued.</P>
    <P>In the local survey I mentioned the places where drink was accessed and the reasons the respondents gave for drinking were explored.  A main factor was boredom.  I hope the level of funding for sporting and arts projects will continue to increase because they are constructive ways for young people to overcome that problem. There need to be alternative places for young people to go because the focus of social life in Ireland is the pub.  If young people get involved in sport the sense of self-pride they develop will ensure they do not abuse alcohol because they will want to be fit to play the next match.</P>
    <P>The reform of the licensing laws is complex and there are many issues to be addressed.  I look forward to the report of the select committee and <Col N="1585" /> the implementation of its recommendations.  The mindset of the consumers has changed.  We go out later and stay out later.  I have experience as a consumer and as an employee in a licensed premises. Wage levels should also be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to give the impression that I am against extending the hours of opening.  Unlike Deputy McGennis I was asked by a constituent to seek to have pubs open all night.  Other countries may have late opening but they may also have siestas.  There are different attitudes to alcohol consumption in other countries.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell who said that pubs do not have to open until later.  A pub which is closed when the others are open will lose business.  Deputy McGahon was right in much that he said but I would not tar everyone with the same brush.  Bars sell soft drinks and the prices should be examined.  The pub and drinking culture is an important aspect of Irish social life and it deserves priority in the legislative programme. I cannot agree with this Bill but I look forward to the report of the select committee.</P>

      <P>I have a long standing interest in the licensing laws.  From a young age I worked clearing tables and when the occasional octagonal threepence was put my way I was delighted.  At one stage while in college I was a member of MANDATE.  I note that union is opposed to the Bill which indicates that more consultation is needed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton's tongue is so firmly in his cheek that he would have difficulty in lowering a pint. This is an opportunistic Bill which is taking up Private Members' time.  The sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is near to concluding its deliberations on the licensing laws.  As Deputy Upton realises, the previous Select Committee on Legislation and Security had done a lot of work on the issue and received many representations from outside bodies.  It was the advent of a general election and a summer recess which held up its work.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an embarrassment to the Opposition. I understand Fine Gael is reluctant to support it but it understands that the Government side will vote it down.  The Fine Gael and the Labour Party members of the select committee which is considering the licensing laws know that changes which have been fully thought out and discussed by consumers and members of the trade will be brought forward soon by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> There are normally three hours per week for Private Members' time and this premature Bill is taking up two weeks of that time.  If it were not common knowledge in the House and throughout the industry that new legislation on the licensing laws was in gestation the initiation of this Bill would be welcome.  However, that is not the case. There are other more important matters, such as refugees, human rights, the drug problem, and to waste valuable Private Members' time on an issue which is being dealt with already demonstrates a thought vacuum on the Labour Party benches. Perhaps the Labour Party badly needs the cerebral members of Democratic Left to come up with legislation that might rock the foundations of the State.</P>
    <P>There is widespread distaste at the idea of opening pubs on Good Friday.  Those of religion and of none respect the wish of a predominantly Christian country to have Good Friday as a day on which the pubs do not open.  In the pluralist society to which we aspire on the basis of the Good Friday Agreement, in which each wishes to respect the traditions and culture of all others on the island, if there is a desire for pub opening on Good Friday it is a matter that could be examined. I am not aware of a religious or cultural group which feels strongly about pub opening on Good Friday.  We should not interfere with the existing arrangements for Good Friday.</P>
    <P>The idea of later opening hours has widespread support throughout the community.  It would be archaic if on Friday, 31 December 1999, as we approach the year 2000, people were not legally entitled to raise their glasses among friends and neighbours to toast the beginning of the third millennium. Changing lifestyles demand greater latitude for people to decide when they can have a social drink.  It is wrong that tourists and holidaymakers during the summer, particularly at the August weekend when there is a feel-good atmosphere throughout the country, cannot get a drink after 11.30 p.m. While changes are needed, it is unacceptable for Deputy Upton to cherrypick in a pre-emptive strike manner, the key points of the consultants' report without dealing with all of the details and consequences.  In the meantime I am sure there is no pub in Dublin South-Central that would not serve Deputy Upton until 12.30 a.m. any night, except Good Friday and Christmas Day.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's position on the Bill.  This area must be examined, and we are examining it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> There is an argument for extending opening hours.  The development of this industry and European law highlights the need for new licensing laws.  Bar extensions and the preparation of food must be considered in the European context and in the light of consumers' requirements.  The majority of consumers want longer opening hours, but they also want the grey area of bar extensions and food preparation dealt with in legislation.</P>
    <P>The abolition of Sunday closing form 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. is reasonable, but opening pubs and clubs on Good Friday would be unacceptable.  Pubs are asked to close on only Christmas Day and Good Friday each year.  There is a tradition that people's attitudes change, perhaps through spiritual intervention, when it comes to Good Friday. We should allow the day to remain special by keeping pubs closed.</P>
    <P>A critical part of this and any future legislation in this area relates to off-licences.  Major stores have off licensing facilities and they should be governed by proper laws.  Off-licences are a cause of concern to parents because much under age drinking starts with younger people getting older friends to purchase drink for consumption elsewhere. A similar problem pertains in respect of big supermarkets.  I have no difficulty with the family run off-licences in my town.  Many of the submissions on this subject will have to be taken into consideration.  Off-licences should be actively monitored and curtailed.</P>
    <P>The concept of an identity card should also be addressed.  Education on drink is not dealt with under the Bill.  That must form part of an overall package to confront the social problems caused by drink.  Parents and various organisations demand such a package and we must respond.</P>
    <P>Some publicans claim extended opening hours would result in a more civilised pattern of drinking, with fewer problems at closing time.  There is no evidence to support that argument.  Many years ago a similar argument was put forward in favour of extending the opening hours.  When the hours were extended, however, there was little change in the pattern of drinking, apart from the fact that consumption of alcohol continued to increase.  It would not make sense for pubs to stay open later unless they could sell a substantial additional amount of drink because their overheads, such as overtime payment for staff and the additional cost of heating, lighting and so on would be significant.</P>
    <P>Additional consumption of drink could add to the problems currently associated with the abuse of alcohol, such as road accidents, domestic violence, child neglect and public disorder.  Extending opening hours would be of particular concern to the owners of hotels, discos and restaurants who fear encroachment by publicans on their important night trade.  On a more positive note, a liberalisation of the licensing laws could be seen to reflect the current reality of the licensed opening hours resulting from extensions and special <Col N="1588" /> food licences.  Extension of trading hours would also benefit the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister and hope we do not have to wait too long for detailed legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Upton on introducing the Bill.  As one who introduced a few Private Members' Bills in the past, I realise the amount of work, with very little back-up, that goes into their drafting.  The Deputy also deserves credit for initiating this debate.  I am assured Deputy Ardagh did not mean what he said in his final comments.  His original comments reflected his views on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Even if the Deputy is pre-empting the work of the review committee, I am sure its members will read with interest the contributions made on the Second Stage of the Bill and perhaps include some of the suggestions in its final report. Because the problem of alcohol abuse is so prevalent in our history, a thorough debate on the issue is welcome.  It is a coincidence that the Irish Vintners' Federation is holding its national conference in Tralee this evening.  We are getting some feedback from it on the current laws and on the question of introducing a national ID system which it now supports.  Its thinking in this area is also evolving.</P>
      <P>We must address the issues of alcohol abuse and opening hours.  Deputy Upton's Bill addresses only the question of opening hours. The question of over indulgence is in some form related to opening hours.  I am sure most Members have visited countries where there is almost no prohibition on opening times.  In the United States, for example, pubs remain open quite late, but there is not a high incidence of alcoholism or public disorder on the streets as a result.  Opening times are restricted here and, as Deputy McGennis said, that can lead to binge drinking for which we were famous in the past for all the wrong reasons.</P>
      <P>The culture of drinking in Ireland is changing. There are not as many people drunk on our streets and in the pubs.  I do not see any evidence in the pubs I frequent of people getting drunk to the same extent as in the past.  We are becoming more educated in terms of alcohol consumption and people control their drinking more than in the past.  However, I accept there is a major problem with under-age drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with an extension of opening hours to 1 a.m. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that it is up to the publican to decide the time he or she wishes to close.  I am sure publicans in rural areas will not keep their premises open until 1 a.m. if they have no customers.  However, they can set acceptable times with their customers. <Col N="1589" /> There is a problem in tourist areas, such as Kerry, where it is difficult to get tourists out who are on holiday and enjoy the pub culture.  They may not drink much but, nevertheless, their holidays are disrupted and their enjoyment spoiled if they are forced to leave a pub before midnight.  We must look seriously at changing the law from a tourism point of view.  It is inevitable that will happen as the Minister and the committee will come up with proposals for the extension of opening hours.</P>
    <P>The holy hour on Sundays serves little purpose and I cannot see anybody opposing opening all day on Sundays.  I have a problem with pubs opening on Good Friday.  The licensing law in this regard should not be tampered with as it is important Good Friday is seen as a different day in the lives of the people and I am very much opposed to opening on Good Friday.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to health education and complimented the Minister on his recent initiative where he launched a new programme. In the past there were several health education programmes which concentrated on the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse and other issues. However, they were based on an <i>ad hoc</i> principle where a scheme was launched and then forgotten. There was no reinforcement or continuity where one scheme could be put forward in isolation. The health education bureau has not been replaced since it was scrapped and serious consideration should be given towards restoring it or setting up a similar body.  As a former physical education teacher, I participated in an ongoing health education programme in my school and could see its value.  Nationally, there is no communication between the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  They operate within departmental straitjackets with regard to health education and issues such as alcohol abuse.  I hope the Minister refers to that in her reply.</P>
    <P>I refer to the question of a national identity card system.  I am one of many in the House who promoted this concept over the years.  We had an opportunity in Government and did not introduce it, but serious consideration should be given towards the introduction of such a system.  I was heartened by the support given to it by the outgoing president of the Vintner's Federation of Ireland yesterday in Tralee.  A mandatory national scheme is needed and the Government should introduce the necessary legislation, as a result of which publicans would have something to go on.  They cannot control teenage drinking in the current climate.  Many locally based identity schemes have been effective while others have not because they were not monitored properly.</P>
    <P>The Vintner's Federation of Ireland referred to the inadequacies in current licensing laws, which are indefensible.  I agree with it and the ongoing review of the joint committee needs to produce new proposals quickly.  If they demand legislation, it should be introduced.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and compliment Deputy Upton for introducing it even though many colleagues feel a great deal of the work had been done by the joint committee.  It is a simplistic Bill in that it deals particularly with licensing laws but not with other difficult issues associated with licensed premises.  I have no difficulty with opening time remaining at 10.30 a.m. However, I disagree with the proposed change in closing time from 11.30 p.m. in the summer and 11 p.m. in the winter to 12.30 a.m. Closing time is 11.30 p.m. during the summer but there are 30 minutes drinking up time.  It is the greatest difficulty for rural publicans, and I am one, to contend with because locals figure closing time is not until midnight so they will come in at 11.55 p.m. thinking they still have 30 minutes to drink up.  It is difficult for the Garda to police this in rural areas where they know most of the people on licensed premises. Local gardaí in the area I represent have been pragmatic in their policing of opening hours.  The only way to deal with that would be to have closing time at 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m. during the summer. If closing time is 1.30 a.m. there would be no half hour drinking-up time and if the publican had customers on his premises after that time he would be aware he and his customers could be hauled before the courts for breach of the licensing laws.  Closing times of 1 a.m. during the summer and 12.30 a.m. in winter would be sufficient.</P>
      <P>I agree that Sunday opening hours from 12.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. should be replaced with normal opening hours.  I agree also with opening hours on St. Patrick's day but not with opening on Good Friday.  This probably results from my conservative upbringing.  Deputy Ellis is a former publican in my constituency.  In the past a few pubs attempted to open on Good Friday but most of them remained closed.  If we cannot survive without drink for two days it is too bad.</P>
      <P>The late opening discos are supposed to provide food.  We have all heard horror stories about discos, drugs and all types of shenanigans.  I was reared mid-way through the disco era and attempted to do much of my socialising at discos. There are many good discos and well run establishments. Those which are badly run get the publicity while those which are run perfectly well are taken for granted.</P>
      <P>If the pub licensing laws were amended to extend opening hours to 1 a.m. it would be very difficult for many people who have invested heavily to survive if the hours for discos extended only to 1.30 a.m. If the licensing hours for public houses are extended, in fairness to most of the disco proprietors and hoteliers the disco licence should be extended to 2.30 a.m. or 3.  a.m. Apart from that, the way it is proposed to be dealt with it through the courts would be unfair because judges will make different decisions in different areas.  This aspect which is not dealt with in the Bill should be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support fully my colleague Deputy Deenihan and others who have proposed a national identity <Col N="1591" /> card scheme.  Such a scheme would have to be introduced on a mandatory basis.  We would only fool ourselves if we believed otherwise.  I know of two 15 year old girls who have identity cards saying they are 20 years old.  This happens in every area.  The publicans know they have a problem and in consultation with the local garda they try to introduce a scheme.  We have to take into consideration also that there are many publicans who know they are serving drink to under age persons. Given the legislation it is difficult for any member of the Garda Síochána to accuse a publican of serving drink to under age persons.</P>
    <P>I lived and worked in New York for a number years.  An identity card scheme was rigidly operated in that state and in New Jersey.  Nobody could get a drink unless he was over 18 years of age.  There is no good reason a national identity card scheme should not be introduced.  In both rural and urban areas children of 13 and 14 years of age are drinking.  By the time they reach the age of 18 the buzz has gone out of alcohol and they turn to drugs.  We have a serious drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The national identity card scheme would play a major part in trying to control the problem and I hope the Government will introduce one.  It would go a long way in helping to regulate deficiencies and solve problems affecting society in general.  It will not solve all our problems but it would be the basis and foundation for solving some of them.  It is time we considered our licensing laws.  We are a progressive mature society.  We base much of our progress on attracting tourists, many of whom cannot understand the reason pubs close at 11.30 p.m. during the summer.  This debate is worthwhile.  The Government should take the matter on board and have legislation enacted as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome not only the discussion here but the debate which has been taking place in the committee for the past two years.  The cross-party committee examined the matter in depth, consulted widely and is working towards a deadline for completion of its report.  This is a comprehensive and responsible way of presenting what is difficult legislation.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with Deputy Upton's Bill is that it considers only the parameters of hours of admittance, ejection and enforcement, without considering many other areas which, if we are to introduce reformed legislation in this area, would have to deal with.</P>
      <P>This debate and committee's report will raise issues other than the times and hours of drinking. It has to do with our behaviour, our perception of ourselves and our experience of how we view drink.  I was struck by Deputy Cecilia Keaveney who referred to a survey carried out in her area. She pointed out, as many Deputies have done, the real concern about under age drinking where young people are unable to control themselves and the resultant bad effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> Deputy Keaveney mentioned that in that survey many young people did not drink at home with their parents or in a social capacity such as with meals or on Sunday afternoons.  Our concentration on drinking has not been as social and as moderate as it should be.  We have focused on and done much of our drinking in the pub.  That does not take away from the importance of what we have to do regarding the conditions, standards and opening and closing times of pubs.  Countries which drink in a moderate and highly enjoyable way do so without guilt and little binging attached to it.  This is because it is looked on as positive in moderation and enjoyable, particularly as an accompaniment with meals.  We only have to look at Mediterranean countries, where people imbibe and enjoy wine.  European tables show a high level of consumption of wine and alcohol. However, the people there have a long and enjoyable lifestyle.  They live longer than in countries where people do not treat alcohol in the same way.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the report of the committee is important.  The more prohibitively and disparately we treat licensing hours and drinking the worse it will get.  We should look at the experience of prohibition in the United States which resulted in a sense of guilt, illegal drinking and activities beyond that.  This demonstrates how counter-productive that type of enforcement can be.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee will hopefully give the Government the option to introduce a wider and more considerable Bill.  If we extend drinking hours, we must also take the conditions and standards of work for bar staff into consideration. These are part of the legislation.  Successful publicans cannot claim, from the profits they are making, that they cannot afford to look after their staff properly.</P>
    <P>While there is a problem with underage drinking on one side of the counter, the employment of underage staff must also be questioned.  They are not only exploited by low pay and bad conditions but are also exposed to an atmosphere which is not conducive to their development.</P>
    <P>I deplore the high tariff on non-alcoholic drinks &mdash; it is almost as if one is penalised for drinking them.  It is outrageous, particularly when we are trying to implement a safe drink driving programme. It is not only mineral water which is priced exorbitantly, but also non-alcoholic beer and wine.  We have to look into this.  If we are to encourage people not to drink alcohol solidly throughout an evening or to allow one or two people to abstain from alcohol for safe driving, they must not be made pay through the nose for drinking a non-alcoholic drink when everyone else is drinking merrily.</P>
    <P>We must integrate a programme in the school system to encourage drinking for enjoyment, as part of a civilised way of life.  Different age groups should be encouraged to drink together at different venues.  We all appreciate, as do many people outside this country, the craic engendered in the <Col N="1593" /> pub.  If we do not drink immoderately and treat alcohol consumption as normal and enjoyable, that will continue.  We need an education programme which protects our young people and allows them to learn how to drink in a proper and enjoyable way.</P>
    <P>We all deplore binge drinking for the sake of getting drunk rather than drinking for taste and convivial purposes.  It is important that enjoyment is not taken away by people drinking to get drunk and the terrible effects of that.  I hope the Second Stage of this Bill is passed.  The depth and breadth of the committee's work should be utilised to provide the legislation which both sides of the House welcome and know is urgently needed.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill by Deputy Upton has given us a chance to focus on what has been a major issue for a number of years.  It is about 20 years since opening hours were reviewed and opening hours on Sunday were increased by an hour, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., which was changed again subsequently.</P>
      <P>Social changes have taken place as regards drinking.  I agree with many of the speakers that there is a greater need than ever before for education about drinking.  None of us want to see young people binge drinking.  It is sad that this mentality has developed.  Parents have a duty to educate their children about drinking.  No parent should be afraid of allowing his or her children to drink with them.  This is better than being antialcohol, which often leads to bigger problems. When young people drink a glass of wine or beer in the company of their parents, they are better able to cope with it at a later stage than those who drink behind their parents' back.</P>
      <P>We can all remember funny incidents about drinking in our early days.  There was a funny side to it afterwards, but not at the time.  The lashing out of many parents at their teenagers' drinking led to greater problems in the home at a later stage.  There is a need for education in our school system about the dangers of drink.  I agree with Deputy Gerry Reynolds that when the buzz from drink goes, there is a danger that young people will move to drugs.  If they are properly educated about drink, it can make life a great deal easier and they do not suffer peer pressure as regards drugs and other harmful substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree with later closing in the summer. However, in the winter, except at weekends, there is no need for 12.30 a.m. closing plus half an hour drinking up time.  On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 11.30 p.m. closing is sufficient. Perhaps weekend closing hours should be different because people socialise.  Longer opening <Col N="1594" /> hours are not in the best interests of publicans or those who drink.</P>
    <P>I am against opening pubs on Christmas Day and Good Friday.  I was reared in a pub and those were the only two days one could close the door and have a day off.  Everyone involved in the drinks trade accepts that pubs should remain closed on these days.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with the disco scene, which is much broader than any of us can deal with.  There are problems with age, identity and the fact that discos are frequented by people much younger than those who went to discos ten or 15 years ago.  We now hear 14 year olds saying that they do not want to go to discos run by social clubs and others.  It is the old story, the buzz has gone out of the teenage hops, as we knew them, for 14 year olds who want to move to the bigger scene.  This is not in their best interests but there is little parents can do about it.  The only hope is that they have an older brother, sister or friend who will mind them on their initial visits.</P>
    <P>We need to look long and hard at the hours discos remain open.  If publicans are allowed to remain open longer, discos will have to be allowed to do the same.  We will have to find a happy medium.  We will have to determine a time at which it will be socially acceptable for discos to close.  No one wants them to remain open until 4 a.m. at which time people who have to work the following day will fall out of them.  That is not realistic.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of publicans should be reviewed.  Publicans have a responsibility to their customers.  They should cease serving people under the influence of drink.  This is in their own interest, although they may not appreciate it at the time.  They will come to realise the following day that the publican had done them a favour. This will happen mainly where publicans are familiar with the people with whom they are dealing but in cities barmen possess less knowledge about their clientele and it may be much harder for them to deal with somebody who has had too much to drink.  We have all heard about the people who have fallen, having had too much to drink, and suffered horrific injuries, even death. There should be a reference, therefore, in the new licensing laws to the responsibilities of publicans to ensure the safety and well-being of their clients.  We have all heard the horror stories about people who have fallen in pubs and were later found on the pavement.  This is not acceptable. Many questions have to be asked and answered.</P>
    <P>We could all talk for a long time about binge drinking, underage drinking and those involved in the licensed trade.  Those who work in public houses do not have an easy job and work long hours.  Their working day does not finish when they close the door on the last customer, they have to clean up and get everything ready for the next day.  We have to look at the social consequences of liberalising the licensing laws too much because those who work in public houses <Col N="1595" /> have wives and families at home who wonder if their loved ones are still working and how they will get home.</P>
    <P>We should allow the committee to make its report before implementing any changes.  The matter should be teased out.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that it should be referred back to the committee which should look long and hard at all aspects of the licensing laws.  It is not a question of increasing the number of hours but of making it a more social business.</P>

      <P>In the short time I have been a Member no legislation has generated as much debate among the public as this Bill.  In recent weeks I have spoken to many people about it.  It deals with a contentious issue on which everybody has an opinion.  Many families have been touched by drink and drink related illness.</P>
      <P>Some people are of the opinion that the licensing laws should not be touched.  It is not the function of the licensing laws, however, to ensure a husband or a wife stays at home with their family but sin scéal eile.  It would be a major decision to extend opening hours.  It would affect nearly everybody in the country.  There is a saying in north Cork that there is one thing worse than being too late and that is bringing in something too early.  The matter should be given much thought.</P>
      <P>In seeking an extension of opening hours, some sections of the tourism industry have argued that we should not expect tourists to leave a public house or licensed premises at 12 midnight, that they should be allowed to enjoy the company they are in for a further few hours.  Surely it is not being said that the only thing Ireland has to offer the tourist is drink?  This afternoon I spoke to a former hotel manager whom I know well and asked her for her opinions on the matter.  She indicated that in her experience the extension of opening hours was never considered contentious by tourists.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes that the issue should be referred back to the committee.  It ought to be the subject of a full and rigorous debate.  Every section of the community should be consulted.  I am aware that the trade unions which represent those who work in public houses are very much against the extension of opening hours.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ellis said, 13 and 14 year olds no longer want to go to discos organised by youth clubs or GAA clubs, rather they want to go to ones where alcohol is on sale.  We should educate young people on the proper use of drink.  As said by numerous people, the next step from alcohol abuse is drug abuse.  Children should be educated at an early age about the pitfalls.  It is not good enough to provide a one hour or one and a half hour course once a year in second level schools. A range of services should be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, outlined the reasons for the Government decision in opposing the Bill proposed by Deputy Upton.  The subject of intoxicating liquor legislation commands great interest inside and outside the House.  There is a developing consensus that the way forward in relation to improving our liquor licensing laws is to await the recommendations of the subcommittee which has devoted much energy to a review of the licensing code.</P>
      <P>The Minister has undertaken that any recommendations arising from that review will be given serious consideration with a view to any amending legislation that may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Members of the House have stressed that it is important to get any such legislation in this area correct.  That goes without saying, but in order to get it right there needs to be full consultation.  We have heard over and over again during the debate that everybody has a view on the liquor laws.  As Deputy McDowell and other speakers have said, everybody has an opinion on this matter.  Perhaps the fact that the debate continued over Easter was of interest because everywhere I went people had an opinion on this issue.  It is important that all those views should be considered in the wider debate.  Undoubtedly, many more views will be expressed.</P>
      <P>An important fact raised in the debate is that the principal union involved in the licensing trade, MANDATE, is still reported as being opposed to longer opening hours.  This must be taken into consideration.  A sensible approach to the possible updating of the law in this area would be one in a context where the many views, opinions, and reservations of interested parties are properly articulated, reflected upon, and measured so as to ascertain as balanced a view as possible of the law.</P>
      <P>We have heard suggestions that our licensing laws are archaic, outmoded or out of synch with modern day living.  The difficulty is that for every view that is put forward in this area there is a contrary view.  Public debate on the issues is not only complex but extremely sensitive.  It is that very complexity and sensitivity which does not permit simple or piecemeal solutions.</P>
      <P>Great store is being placed on the provisions in this Bill which would allow the courts to vary the hours of opening which would operate in different parts of the country or between public houses in the same locality.  We need to examine this point.  The argument is that in a tourist area the courts would be able to modify opening hours to suit special needs.  The question this raises is whether such a provision would disadvantage owners of public houses and other licensed establishments in adjacent counties or towns, who for one reason or another are not regarded as meeting the criteria of particular licensing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken about the effects of the Garda Síochána's initiative in certain parts <Col N="1597" /> of the country and have argued that the only effect it has had is to curb the trade in the affected areas and encourage people to travel to where it would be possible to get a late drink without the next knock on the door being that of a member of the Garda Síochána.  Would this Bill achieve a similar result?  For example, if town A has later opening hours under this Bill than town B, say ten miles away, is there not a danger that there will be an imbalance which will encourage people to travel to get a later drink?  Will not the publicans in town A complain that they are losing trade to town B?  I mention this to illustrate how apparently sensible provisions may operate negatively or create even further anomalies in the licensing code.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of our legislation has been to create uniform opening and closing hours as central to the licensing code.  The thrust of this Bill would be to do away with that and to create almost ghetto-like pockets of late night drinking. There are many who would not be convinced that this would be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputies may query the uniformity which exists at present among pubs in as far as opening and closing hours are concerned.  The figure of some 65,000 special exemptions dealt with by the courts in the year August 1996 to July 1997 might tend to indicate a lack of uniformity about opening and closing hours rather than uniformity. However, on examination of that figure of 65,000 exemptions one finds that it includes all special exemptions sought by the holders of on-licences for premises which are hotels or restaurants, exemptions which are not open to the holders of publicans' licences only.  Additionally, premises which operate as night-clubs regularly apply for such special exemptions and are included in the figure.</P>
    <P>There are many who are genuinely fearful that later opening hours for pubs and clubs will lead to a worsening situation in relation to the abuse of alcohol.  On the one hand, there are those who argue that those who abuse alcohol will do so anyway and that longer opening hours would, therefore, have no major effect on the situation. There are also those who would argue that were opening hours to be extended persons would start to drink later in the evening, particularly in the summer months, and would not necessarily drink more as a result.</P>
    <P>Of major concern is whether later opening hours will solve or create problems.  There are, for example, the public order difficulties, which were referred to during the debate, associated with persons spilling on to the streets at closing time.  The question which arises, however, is whether closing times of midnight or 1 a.m. would lessen or add to such difficulties.  We need to listen closely to all interests on the matter and this is one of the benefits of awaiting the full report of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has this week launched the National <Col N="1598" /> Alcohol Awareness Campaign.  The importance of that campaign lies in the recognition that alcohol, both in its use and misuse, plays a huge role in society.  The campaign seeks to create an awareness of the potential for damage which exists in alcohol abuse, while recognising that, used sensibly, alcohol has many positive aspects.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the most appropriate way forward in relation to the complex and important issues raised by this Bill is to proceed with careful deliberation, taking into account the various public debates and interests as well as the consultative procedures of the kind currently engaged in by Members of the House on the sub-committee. The Government regards this Bill as premature and not the way to proceed at this time.  It does not propose to accept the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Between 30 and 40 Deputies contributed in all.  I thank my colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party for allowing me the opportunity to present the Bill on behalf of the party.  I also thank those who helped me to prepare the Bill, in particular Mr. Richard Humphries and Mr. Kevin Baneham.</P>
      <P>I have been heartened by the public response and support I have received since the publication of the Bill.  There is a clear consumer demand to modify the licensing laws to suit modern lifestyles. There is an urgent need to immediately reform the drinking regulations as they apply to opening hours.</P>
      <P>This Bill has sparked an important public debate on the issue.  I have been heartened by the comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in support of modernising the licensing laws.  He has publicly stated his support in the media for the immediate modernisation of the licensing laws by this summer.  I welcome his comments.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister of State is in close touch with his constituents and he is prepared to listen to them.  It is a pity that many of his colleagues on the Government benches seem determined to ignore the clear wishes of the vast majority of the general public, especially the younger element of the population.</P>
      <P>The intervention of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, follows from the full implementation of the law by the Garda in four western counties &mdash; Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Clare.  The public disquiet in these areas illustrates clearly that people wish to stay in public houses longer than for the period now legislated for.  It is also clear from the public response that the law is being flouted to a large degree.</P>
      <P>The gardaí cannot be blamed or faulted for implementing the law.  Their job is to implement the laws passed by the Oireachtas.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us as public representatives to modernise the law as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has not taken the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  He feels that opening hours <Col N="1599" /> must be extended as provided for in this Bill.  I find the attitude adopted by the Minister of State hard to understand in the context of the legislative programme published by the Government earlier this week.  The Government has failed to include such a Bill in its legislative programme.  I fail to see how the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will provide for extended opening hours before the end of this summer, as seems to be his wish.  The only way this can be done is by voting for this Bill.  In terms of the practical realities of politics that is what it comes down to.  Anyone who pretends otherwise is just fooling themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, now has two choices.  He can support the Bill or he can meekly follow the Government Whip.  From his public statements he should support the Bill and if he does not do so, he has no choice but to accept that his credibility will be gravely damaged.</P>
    <P>I am greatly disappointed by the response given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the Bill. The Minister has given no commitment to modernise the licensing laws as they apply to opening hours.  He has mentioned consideration, reviews, ongoing scenarios and meaningful exchanges but no hard promises &mdash; no beef, in other words.  The Minister has shown scant understanding of the need for reform.  He has failed to grasp that the laws are out of date.  He does not comprehend that the law is tolerable only if the Garda Síochána chooses to allow pubs to break it.  To continue to allow the present disregard for the law to prevail is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister refuses to recognise both the strong public desire for reform and the outdated nature of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not jump the gun and is not opportunistic, it is a response to legislative paralysis. The Government does not seem to be committed to changing that.  It moves the debate forward and it wrestles the issue of opening hours from the quagmire of detail and inaction.  Committees of the Oireachtas have been discussing this fairly basic matter for more than two years. During the last Dáil the relevant committee received detailed submissions from all interested parties.  Opening hours have been widely discussed and analysed for that period and longer.  I spoke on this issue in the early 1990s and in 1995 I took the opportunity to highlight it again when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, introduced minor changes to the licensing laws on off-licence sales on Christmas Eve.</P>
    <P>A welcome discussion by the House on the need to alter the licensing laws was triggered by the work of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  However, that work seems to have stagnated.  The Government has failed to act on one of the most important issues requiring immediate attention.  The committee process has become bogged down in detail and minor issues <Col N="1600" /> and has not addressed this question as a matter of urgency.  The opening hours of public houses is a crucial issue for many people and is in need of urgent attention.  The Bill has sparked a public debate and brought attention to the issue.  It has broken the paralysis which has gripped the committee and the House in tackling the question of opening hours.  I hope it will break the legislative stagnation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy McDowell, and other Members of the relevant Dáil committees. I recognise the work done by Deputy Flanagan and I compliment him on his efforts to secure comprehensive change.  However, that work is not an excuse for inaction.  We cannot forego reform of an urgent issue such as the licensing laws because of ongoing analysis by committees of this House.  I reject the suggestion that when this comprehensive report is published, it will be possible to take action in the immediate short-term.  Is anyone suggesting that if changes are proposed in the way licences are issued it will not stir up a hornet's nest and lead to greater paralysis than we have already seen?</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to do what can be done while we have the opportunity and in accordance with the wishes of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey.  I accept this Bill is limited in what it tries to achieve.  That is not because of ignorance of the broader questions involved but because it is based on a pragmatic approach to achieve a realistic target and on the concept of legislating for what is now the practice.  I am sure if one visited public houses tonight between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. there would be plenty of customers and no shortage of drink.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the doomsday scenarios painted by some Members during this debate, such as the evils of alcoholism and the fact that young people drink too much.  I accept that many of the points were valid.  However, no one gave evidence that what is proposed would make the situation worse.  There was an obligation on those people to do that.  We want to introduce legislation to ensure that the law which is now being flouted will be adhered to.  Deputy Jim Higgins said that publicans who now adhere to the law &mdash; they are probably a small minority &mdash; are at an economic disadvantage because other publicans stay open half the night and customers will move accordingly.  That is an unfair economic sanction on people who adhere to the law.  The Minister should address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies said they are opposed to the proposal to allow pubs to open for business on Good Friday.  I do not accept that these objections are valid.  There is sufficient demand to justify pubs opening on Good Friday.  There is no obligation on anyone who owns a public house to open on Good Friday or on anyone who wishes to stay away from pubs to visit one.  We want to ensure that a choice is available to that section of the community which wants to avail of it.  I fully <Col N="1601" /> respect people who want to adhere to religious practice and stay away from pubs on Good Friday. However, I do not accept that the legislation should impose those religious concepts on an element of the population which wishes to obtain drink on Good Friday.</P>
    <P>A number of comments were made about the position taken by people who work in public houses.  We went out of our way to cater for those concerns when drafting this Bill.  We have built into the Bill a series of provisions to ensure that the rights of people who work in public houses are fully protected and that they should be allowed to opt out if that is what they wish.  There <Col N="1602" /> are also provisions to ensure they are well compensated if they decide to work the extra hours.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily designed to increase the level of choice for consumers.  We are trying to modernise the licensing laws and to bring our practice into line with what is happening in most other European countries.  We do not know when the committee will publish its report or what action, if any, will be taken, but we know it will be long, detailed and complex.  It will give rise to a new debate, but the <i>status quo</i> will prevail.  The <i>status quo</i> is unacceptable so we should act now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past couple of weeks two key reports were published by the Government. About a fortnight ago the report of the Commission on the National Minimum Wage was published and last weekend the National Employment Plan was published.</P>
      <P>Both these reports were &ldquo;launched&rdquo;, if that is the correct word, in an extraordinary way.  First, the report of the Commission on the National Minimum Wage, which was three or four months late, was effectively released by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney to the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme where a few key details were mentioned, including the £4.40 per hour rate.</P>
      <P>For the following 24 hours or so, I and other Opposition spokespersons were continually queried by the media about the contents of the report and of course we did not have a copy of it.  I had to mention it to the Taoiseach the following day, Monday, when, finally, it became available at about midday.</P>
      <P>At that stage it turned out that there were fewer than 100 copies of the report available.  We have become used to glossy reports from Government and semi-State bodies, but both of the reports in question look like something which would have been produced in about 1950, and I wonder why.</P>
      <P>With regard to the report of the Commission on the National Minimum Wage, we were given very little information, very late.  Then last weekend it was the same story with regard to the action plan on employment.  It was selectively leaked to Independent Newspapers.  Copies were not made available to other newspapers and the political spokespersons, mainly Deputy Owen, Deputy Rabbitte and me, until late on Monday.  I was also told by my party's research department that we received only one copy when it finally appeared.  I still do not have a copy of it, which is a disgrace.  Three and a half days after Minister Harney supposedly launched this document there is no sign of it, a few, well-thumbed copies are circulating in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome these reports.  The report of the Commission on the National Minimum Wage is courageous and timely.  The National Employment Plan of course is something which the Government is required to do by the EU.  The latter report, the employment action plan, offers little which is new.  It seems to be largely a conjuring trick by the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>The basic point in both instances is that the treatment of the Opposition in this House by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has been disgraceful. At least, we might have expected a weekday press conference on both these important documents, followed immediately by publication.  At best, we might have expected that they would have been launched in this House at the start of a significant debate on both key policies.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Harney sat on this side of the House she would have been merciless with any Minister who refused to be open, transparent and accountable to this House.</P>
      <P>She is now behaving in a disgraceful way in her treatment of the Opposition.  She has done so for two reasons.  First, she has been trying to garner the kudos from the National Minimum Wage Commission and in regard to the second document she has been trying to avoid me and other Deputies who wish to ask her detailed and searching questions on the employment plan.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Harney, or her representative here tonight to apologise to the House for playing politics with two very important national policy documents and to initiate a full debate in the House.  I would welcome the opportunity, as I think would the other Opposition spokesperson, to be briefed by senior officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome both reports and look forward to spending a number of days discussing them.  The method of their publication was disgraceful.  Yesterday we witnessed the launch of the Freedom of Information Act and in this case senior spokespersons representing major interest groups have been treated in a most cavalier way by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I would ask that that will not happen again so that we will not be forced to put down a confidence motion or pursue more stringent remedies of redress.  I would appreciate if the Ceann Comhairle would ensure the Opposition is treated fairly in the publication of key policy documents.  Many of the interest groups involved still have not received a copy of the National Employment Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to reply to this debate on behalf of my ministerial colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.  The Tánaiste published the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission on Sunday, 5 April 1998.  Copies were placed in the Oireachtas Library on the following day, Monday, 6 April 1998.  The Tánaiste published the National Employment Plan on Monday, 20 April 1998.  Copies had been in the Oireachtas Library since Thursday, 16 April 1998, four days ahead of publication.</P>
      <P>The method of publishing and publicising reports of this nature are matters entirely within the discretion of individual Ministers and members of the Government.  I do not believe, and there is no evidence available to me or to this House to suggest, that the practices being adopted by the Government are any different from those adopted by our predecessors.  In terms of transparency, openness and accountability, there is much more transparency nowadays than when the people who created this wonderful system were in office.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat extraordinary to hear the Deputy complaining about &ldquo;the method&rdquo; of these reports' publication.  They were published in the time honoured way.  I can only surmise that the Deputy's relatively short tenure in this House may be putting him at some disadvantage, or perhaps his discomfiture with the Opposition benches is beginning to show.</P>
      <P>As the Tánaiste stated on 5 April, publication of the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission represents a major step in the process towards implementing a national minimum hourly wage in Ireland.  While I do not want to make an overtly political point of it, it is noteworthy that the Deputy's party, although in Government for a number of years, made no moves in the direction of introducing a minimum wage.  Their support for the commitment in this Government's Action Programme for the Millennium is, nevertheless, to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>As regards the Action Plan on Employment, for the first time the Government has committed itself to a firm target in its drive to reduce unemployment. The action plan's key objective is to reduce unemployment to 7 per cent by the end of the year 2000.  The Government believes this will be done through sustained and enhanced macro-economic policies and by adopting a preventative approach to unemployment.  This latter approach involves interacting with all persons aged under 25 years who are six months on the live register with a view to offering them a job or employment support.  This preventative measure will be extended on a phased basis to everyone over 25 years who has been 12 months on the register.  I hope the Labour Party can see its way to supporting this imaginative new approach to reducing unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that adequate time will be <Col N="1606" /> made available by the Government to have these two very important reports debated in this House in due course.  We look forward to the active positive participation of Deputy Broughan and all Members of the House in debating and analysing the optimism and practical proposals in these two reports.  I hope there will be a collective effort, with positive political leadership and co-ordination, to ensure we create opportunities for those who did not have them in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Last year 500 people died on the roads.  When I first raised the issue of road deaths in the Dáil several weeks ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirmed that the figure for 1998 could reach a record of 600 deaths.  Unfortunately, in the meantime the ongoing escalating slaughter on the roads, particularly the now seemingly inevitable weekend carnage, indicates that even that figure could be surpassed. Last weekend eight people died in road traffic accidents, the previous weekend there were eight deaths and the weekend before that, 14 people died in road traffic accidents.  Many of those deaths could have been avoided.  They were caused by carelessness, recklessness and speed.</P>
      <P>In spite of the excellent clampdown by the Garda, initiatives such as Operation Lifesaver and the detection of 37,000 speeding offences in a three month period, the message is not getting through.  The message is that speed kills, but the slaughter continues unabated.  This weekend possibly a dozen families will be devastated by the consequences of further road tragedies. Unfortunately, we have not arrived at a stage where a speedster is despised as are drivers caught drunk driving.  District judges tell people who are caught driving at more than 100 miles per hour to put a cheque in the poor box and &ldquo;we will call it quits&rdquo;.  There is no need for suspension of a licence, a jail sentence or to tell the insurance company a person has been detected driving dangerously and recklessly at more than 100 miles per hour.  Such trivial treatment of the law by some judges undermines the work of the Garda.</P>
      <P>There is need to call such wanton killing what it is.  It is a misnomer to call injuries or deaths arising from driving negligence mere accidents. They are not accidents.  They are offences, breaches of the law, crimes, and they should be treated as such.  Reckless driving which causes serious injury should not be labelled as dangerous driving.  It should be categorised as criminal negligence causing serious injury.  To describe road deaths involving reckless driving as dangerous driving offences is to completely understate their gravity.  The appropriate charge in this case should be manslaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To charge a person who steals a car and embarks on a joyriding safari as guilty of theft and dangerous driving is to trivialise the offence. To charge a person with dangerous driving who <Col N="1607" /> knowingly leaves the scene of an accident, leaving a body lying on the side of the road, is to completely underestimate a serious crime.  There should be no hesitation in entering a manslaughter charge and obtaining a manslaughter conviction in such cases.  I realise there is the existing charge of involuntary manslaughter in certain cases, but all the Minister has to do is examine the court records to see the handful of occasions on which such a charge has been brought.</P>
    <P>Unless we impose meaningful penalties such as confiscation of vehicles, long-term suspension from driving and jail sentences, all the best intentioned initiatives in the world will not have the desired impact and death on the roads on the present scale will continue and increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Higgins for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strong commitment to respond to the unacceptable level of death and injury on our roads.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of March this year, almost 90 people lost their lives on Irish roads.  This compares to over 100 deaths in the same period last year.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Higgins pointed out, despite relatively positive statistics for the first three months of the year, there was a down-turn during the Easter period when there was an increase in fatal accidents over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that society should be unwilling to pay such a high price for the use of its roads.  We must strive to reduce the risk factor for road users and I welcome the opportunity to outline the Government's intentions in this vital area.  In response to the public and political concern which the deterioration in road safety has evoked, the Taoiseach, toward the end of last year, convened a high level meeting of those mandated with responsibilities in this area.  The Taoiseach's message was that the situation was unacceptable.  He identified road safety as an urgent public health issue and one which the Government is determined to address, if necessary with improved legal instruments and increased resources.  At that meeting, the High Level Group on Road Safety was mandated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to prepare a national strategy on road safety under the direction of the Minister of State with responsibility for road safety, Deputy Molloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This vitally important initiative represents the first time that a structured and systematic approach has been taken to road safety policy in Ireland and it mirrors the similar strategic approach followed by countries with the best road safety records, such as Sweden and the Netherlands.  The preparation and development of this important strategy, under the capable <Col N="1608" /> direction of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, will set the scene for road safety policy for the new millennium and address the challenge presented to us by exceptional economic growth and the resulting increase in traffic volume.</P>
    <P>As far as the Garda authorities are concerned, the enforcement of the road traffic legislation is given a high priority with a view to reducing the numbers of deaths and injuries on roads.  The Garda have taken the following measures to develop a more focused enforcement strategy in dealing with road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>In July 1997, the Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau was established, based at Garda headquarters under the direction of a chief superintendent. Its mission is to co-ordinate and review Garda enforcement on a national basis.  On 14 July 1997, the Garda launched Operation Lifesaver in the Louth-Meath division which is designed to deal with four key offences, namely, speeding, non-wearing of seat belts, drink driving and dangerous driving.  The campaign was extended nationwide last autumn and it is continuing in 1998.  Operation Lifesaver involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks.  The initial results of this campaign, in the period 1 August 1997 to 31 December 1997, reveal that there were 34,202 speeding prosecutions and 42,562 cases were dealt with by on-the-spot fines, 44,357 seat belt offences, 3,312 dangerous driving offences and 2,803 drink driving offences.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been assured by the Garda authorities that Operation Lifesaver will not only continue for the rest of this year but that its effectiveness is being constantly reviewed and improvements to enhance enforcement will be made as necessary.  I wish to further assure the Deputy that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue to ensure that the Garda Síochána have the necessary resources in terms of manpower and equipment to help them monitor and detect breaches of the road traffic laws.</P>
    <P>With regard to manpower, it has been suggested that there should be a separate traffic corps.  However, there is within each Garda Síochána division a special traffic corps with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. In addition, uniformed gardaí throughout the country are involved in road traffic enforcement activity as required.  The Minister is satisfied that the current arrangements whereby traffic corps members deal with other policing issues in addition to traffic related matters is more beneficial generally to the wider community.  This view is also shared by the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>On the issue of equipment, the Garda have the most up to date offence detection equipment. This includes radar guns, tripod mounted lasers and in-car cameras.  In addition, they have the GATSO unit &mdash; a system built into an unmarked vehicle which can monitor large numbers of <Col N="1609" /> vehicles at any one time and provide rapid computerised readouts of those exceeding the speed limit.  It can be deployed at different Garda divisions as required.  As I outlined earlier, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will ensure that the Garda have the latest offence detection technology.  In this regard, he approved an additional GATSO unit in late 1997.  Consideration is currently being given to the provision of additional GATSO units and automated speed detection cameras.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reducing the numbers of deaths and injuries on the roads.  The interagency High Level Group on Road Safety is considering various options as part of the National Strategy on Road Safety which will help to make our roads safer for those who use them. At the same time, the Minister would like to emphasise that enforcement alone cannot succeed unless the motoring public make a serious effort to obey the law.  We know from research into accidents and deaths on our roads that drink driving, for example, is a major contributor.  The first requirement in any attempt to reduce road accidents and death on our roads is a public recognition of the unacceptability of driving having taken drink.  There is too much public tolerance of it.  The Garda Síochána are putting a huge effort into enforcing the law but they can only be partially successful if public attitudes do not change.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to be more active in the area of road safety.  I have outlined the Government's commitment, and the measures the Garda are taking to enforce the law.  Mindful of the acute human tragedy involved in road accidents, we are determined that progress will be made in this critical area.  I again thank Deputy Higgins for raising this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I propose to share time with Deputies McManus, Timmins and Fox.  The fact that so many Members representing County Wicklow intend to speak on this matter indicates that it is not a party political issue but is rather one of great concern. I am glad the Minister for Education and Science is present to take this debate.</P>
      <P>The delay in making a decision on the Kilcoole school is incomprehensible, unforgivable and extremely costly.  It is incomprehensible because this matter has been allowed to dither on since 1985; it is unforgivable because children in Kilcoole, Newcastle, Newtownmountkennedy and surrounding areas are being educationally disadvantaged because of the failure of successive Governments to provide a second level school; and it is costly from the taxpayer's point of view because the value of the site has risen from £50,000 in 1986 to £1.3 million and the price continues to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1985-6 it was decided that Kilcoole should be the site for a new second level <Col N="1610" /> school.  At that time, because of the initiative taken by county councillors, a land bank was purchased in Kilcoole and ten acres were set aside for this school project.  Wicklow County Council offered the VEC and the Department of Education a direct sale of this site but the Department did what it does best &mdash; it dithered, stonewalled and ultimately demurred from taking a decision.</P>
    <P>As already stated, this delay has resulted in the cost of the site rising from £50,000 to £1.3 million. Moreover, in recent years Wicklow County Council has chopped pieces off the site which has declined from ten acres to 7.1 acres.  This makes no sense.  In 1985 the population of Kilcoole and surrounding areas was sufficient to encourage the provision of a school.  That population has virtually doubled in the past 15 years and it will increase by a further 50 per cent under the current county development plan.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that his officials complete their interminable studies, reviews and examinations and make a decision, something they do not do very often?  I am pleased the Minister is present because I want to make it clear that I intend to haunt his office, regardless of who is in power, until this school is built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Roche for sharing time.  I support his views on this matter, the genesis of which dates back many years.  It involves an initiative taken by members of Wicklow County Council who built up a strong case which is recognised as being justified.  These people prepared the ground by ensuring that there was a land bank in place.</P>
      <P>That has been campaigned for vigorously to the point where, when the negotiations to form this Government were taking place, it became a central issue.  In that regard I refer to the Official Report of 26 June 1997 when Deputy Fox indicated her support for this Government and put at the top of her list of items she agreed with it the construction of a secondary school to cope with the rapidly growing population of north east Wicklow, a site for which is available in Kilcoole. She stated: &ldquo;I have received an undertaking that the planning process will be initiated immediately and its building commenced not later than next year&rdquo;.  We are now in this mess and I ask the Minister to respond in the same spirit as we have asked him to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Roche for affording me time to speak on this subject.  I will be brief.  People in the greater Kilcoole area have waited almost 15 years for a promised secondary school.  As Deputy Roche pointed out, the population has doubled in the past 13 or 14 years.  This represents almost three generations of pupils who had to leave the greater area for second level education.  I am sure the Minister will use his good offices to speed up the project.</P>

      <Col N="1611" /> Minister because I believe he has made more progress in the past ten months than has been made in the previous ten years.  I am sure he will appreciate, however, that this matter is a major concern of all the TDs in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the closer one gets to the finishing line, the further away it can seem.  I am sure the Minister will understand the reason we are again putting pressure on him.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions which give me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the provision of a new second level school in Kilcoole, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the background to the case. As the Deputies said, in January 1985 the then Minister for Education approved a new second level school for Kilcoole-Newtownmountkennedy in view of the then anticipated population growth in the area.  The school would be co-educational and would operate under the aegis of County Wicklow vocational education committee.  The level of accommodation to be provided was 500 pupil places.  Department sanction was conveyed to the VEC to enter into negotiations for the purchase of a particular site.  Subsequently, the school was not proceeded with due to a belief that existing schools were in a position to cater for all pupils seeking places and sanction for the acquisition of a site was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The position up to the time of the general election was that this project was not being proceeded with.  That must be made clear.</P>
      <P>Following my appointment, I reviewed the question of the provision of a school in the Kilcoole area.  Deputy McManus raised the contribution of Deputy Mildred Fox to this process.  It is clear that Deputy Fox had a key influence on the decision to proceed with the provision of a second level school in Kilcoole.  She has been relentless, as have Deputies Roche, McManus and Timmins, in terms of the pursuit of this project. It is unfair to suggest that commitments are not being fulfilled.  I want to give a particular undertaking that this school will be built in line with commitments given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population in the area has and will continue to expand.  Currently, officials in my Department are evaluating the number of pupil places, etc., as well as the accommodation schedule in the new school.  It is unfair to say they have dithered in regard to this matter.  It is very easy to blame officials but I reject the criticism made of officials in this regard.  When intermediate bodies such as vocational education committees are involved, Department officials do not and cannot impose their will.  My officials know that a decision has been taken to proceed with a second level school in Kilcoole and that all the stops are to be pulled out in terms of that provision.  We all know that site acquisition and various issues can <Col N="1612" /> cause problems but I do not accept that the blame lies at the door of the Department or the officials.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow vocational education committee is currently in negotiations with Wicklow County Council in relation to the acquisition of a site for the new school.  As the House will appreciate, it would be inappropriate to discuss the details of such financial negotiations before the matter is finalised.</P>
    <P>The Deputies can be assured that, since my appointment, this project has proceeded without undue delay and this will continue to be the case.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Teacher Appointment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and I also thank the Minister for coming into the House to hear my views.</P>
      <P>I urgently request the Minister to appoint a shared remedial teacher for Gaelscoil O Doghair, Monagea and Ahalin national Schools in County Limerick.  These three combined co-educational schools have 402 children on the roll.  As a result of various tests it has been determined that an average of 14 per cent of pupils in each school are in need of remedial teaching.  The numbers involved are 31 pupils in the gaelscoil, 13 in Monagea and 11 in Ahalin, making an overall total of 55 pupils.</P>
      <P>The three schools are situated in close proximity to each other.  The gaelscoil is currently situated in the grounds of the community centre in Newcastle West, while Monagea school is three miles away and Ahalin is approximately five miles from the town centre.  Because of the proximity it is envisaged that the remedial teacher would be in a position to function effectively and efficiently with the minimum amount of time being lost in travelling between schools.  Also, this proximity would allow the principals to develop an effective strategy, in consultation with the teacher, to cater for the specific needs of the pupils requiring remedial attention in their schools.</P>
      <P>There is already close co-operation between the different schools which will be further strengthened by the appointment of a permanent remedial teacher.  These three schools have been making a combined application since 1995. Indeed two of the schools, Monagea and Ahalin, have been requesting a remedial teacher for the past ten years.</P>
      <P>It is now imperative that a remedial teacher is provided for these schools and I ask the Minister to deal with the current unfair situation which prevails where these schools are concerned.  I trust the Minister will appoint a remedial teacher to these schools in the near future.  The children who need remedial teaching deserve to have the facility of a remedial teacher, otherwise they will go on to second level education at a considerable disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I agree that remedial teaching is a key <Col N="1613" /> component part of our education system.  There is an absolute need to improve remedial services in national schools throughout the country.  I have said on a number of occasions that I am concerned to ensure that all schools should have access to a remedial resource.  This is a major challenge and will take time to achieve.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year.  A total of 54 remedial teachers were allocated for the 1997-8 year bringing the number of remedial teachers in place to 1,242.  Of the 3,227 ordinary national schools throughout the country, 2,459 schools now have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or on a shared basis. This means that approximately 74 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Limerick currently have access to a remedial service.  I acknowledge that in the shared cases some schools may only have access to a remedial teacher for a number of hours, but that is the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> It is estimated that 90 per cent of the total number of primary school pupils have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher but we need to do much more to extend that service.</P>
    <P>I am currently engaged in discussions concerning staffing issues for national schools for the next school year.  As part of this, I am reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the provision of remedial services.  As Minister for Education and Science I obviously have to consider demands for improved services across a wide range of special needs.  Unfortunately I am not always in a position to meet all these demands.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of Gaelscoil O Doghair, Monagea national school and Ahalin national school will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be made in respect of the staffing schedules for next September.  I have taken on board the Deputy's comments in relation to the collective needs of the schools.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 April 1998. <Col N="1615" /></P>

      <P>The reorganisation of the Defence Forces, as provided for in the Defence Forces review implementation plan, is still ongoing.  While considerable progress has been made in the reorganisation of the Army, the reorganisation of the Naval Service and the Air Corps is awaiting the outcome of the special studies envisaged in the implementation plan. However, I can confirm in relation to the Army it is envisaged that a total of seven personnel of various ranks will be involved on a full-time basis on health and safety matters.  It is further envisaged that, in addition, a number of Army personnel will also be involved on a part-time basis.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate the number of Naval Service and Air Corps personnel in their new organisations who will be involved in health and safety matters.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the emphasis placed by the military authorities on health and safety matters within the Defence Forces whose members have put a great deal of work into implementing the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, thereby demonstrating a high level of commitment to the health and safety of all Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee on health and safety, comprising both civilian and military personnel, has been engaged in directing and monitoring a comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>The 1994 report of the Defence Forces advisory committee to the Health and Safety Authority acknowledged the excellent work undertaken by the Defence Forces in what is acknowledged to be a constantly evolving process. The report also acknowledged the excellent work done by the Defence Forces in the area of education and training and recommended a policy of continued education and training throughout the Defence Forces.  In this regard education and training in health and safety is continuous and each command organises courses in manual handling, fire and first aid in addition to courses for safety officers and safety representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 to 131 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service.  The arrangements necessary for the provision of the service are, therefore, a matter for that Department.</P>
      <P>Search and rescue coverage on the east coast is provided by the Air Corps from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and on the north west coast from Finner, County Donegal, in addition to the civilian operated search and rescue service being provided at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> As part of an ongoing programme of development of search and rescue services, a civilian operated medium-load carrying search and rescue helicopter is to be provided on the east coast with effect from 1 July 1998.  The service will operate on a temporary basis from Dublin Airport but will be located at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, when certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase have been resolved.  My Department is pursuing this aspect with the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the commencement of this service on the east coast, the search and rescue service currently provided by the Air Corps at Baldonnel will be relocated to the south east coast. This service, which will initially be restricted to daylight hours, utilising an Alouette helicopter, will be based in Waterford.  It is intended to upgrade this service to a 24 one using a Dauphin helicopter at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years has meant that the Air Corps is currently not in a position to provide pilots for the east coast service, as was origionally intended.  Provision is, however, being made in the contract for the provision of the service for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots introduced by my Department last year with the ongoing training of pilots and the yearly recruitment of Air Corps cadets is intended to ensure a continuing supply of well trained pilots for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the protection of our fisheries, I presume the reference is to the recent allegations of harassment of Irish fishing vessels off the south-west coast.  In this regard my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, and I recently discussed the putting in place of new arrangements to ensure a swift response to such incidents.  I will also be dealing with this matter in my reply to Questions Nos. 70, 73 and 97 tabled by Deputies Perry, Mitchell and Gilmore.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances, including allowances payable to members serving overseas, come within the scope of representation of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  It is open to the associations at any time to present a claim for a review of allowances which may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The rates of daily overseas allowance payable to personnel serving with peacekeeping, peace enforcing or military observer missions overseas attract increases in line with general round increases in pay and allowances.  In this regard the overseas allowance has attracted increases under the terms of the PCW.  The local bargaining element of the Partnership 2000 agreement will afford an opportunity for an overall review of the allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The award of damages for personal injury is a matter for the courts and is based on the evidence presented before them.  The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, provides for a time limit of three years within which to initiate proceedings from the date of knowledge of fact, significance and cause of the injury.  This legislation has operated very much in favour of Army hearing loss litigants.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  However, the possibility of disposing of these claims in a context outside <Col N="1621" /> the courts is under active consideration.  My overriding concern is that any such alternative method of compensation would be fair to both the individual claimant and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The potential maximum exposure is impossible to predict with great precision.  I cannot predict the number of people who will ultimately claim. If 50,000 of the potential 150,000 former service personnel made a claim and were compensated on the basis of the current quantum, the total cost could reach £1.5 billion.  However the cost of settling the claims actually on hands is estimated at around £210 million plus £105 million in costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 65, 67, 115, 117 and 121 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  Benefits under this scheme are additional to the survivor's contributory pension <Col N="1624" /> under the social welfare Acts for which soldiers are insured by virtue of their PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>In 1985 a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted when all soldiers &mdash; as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers &mdash; who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme. Unfortunately, not all availed of this option.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that currently there are about 200 Army widows who are not eligible for pensions under the contributory scheme because their late husbands were not members of the scheme.</P>
    <P>At this stage, all soldiers who were serving when the original scheme was introduced in 1978 have had two opportunities to join the scheme. The question of again reopening membership options has been considered on a number of occasions over the past few years but I regret that it has not been found possible to make any concession. In this regard, I should say that there would be implications for many other public sector areas if membership options were reopened in respect of the Defence Forces' scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances come within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and may be processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations. The question of the payment of technician pay to non-commissioned personnel of the Air Corps engaged on search and rescue duties has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential and you will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>
      <P>A study into the Air Corps carried out by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants is at present under consideration.

      <P>The sum of £23.1 million has been provided in this year's estimates in respect of voluntary early retirement (VER) for members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  This sum will enable up to 350 PDF personnel to avail of VER in 1998, in addition to meeting carry-over pension costs of £9.5 million arising from the 1996 and 1997 VER schemes.  A total of 1,235 PDF personnel were granted VER under the 1996 and 1997 schemes and during these two years, an amount in excess of £45 million was expended on these schemes.</P>
      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces. It is estimated that, commencing in 1999, net pay savings of the order of £15 million a year will arise from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force.  From 1999 onwards, 50 per cent of these pay savings will be made available for the procurement of additional equipment and other infrastructural programmes for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>On the 9 December 1997, at Kilworth Firing Range, an accident occurred during firing practices with a 60mm light mortar.  During the exercise, which was being conducted by Defence Forces personnel of the Southern Command, an explosion occurred in the vicinity of the gun position resulting in injuries to five personnel.  A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following the accident and its deliberations are still ongoing.  The court of inquiry will encompass the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry.  As part of the technical board of inquiry, a metallurgical analysis will be carried out.</P>
      <P>Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar is continuing but live firing for training purposes has, however, ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations.  Safety procedures for military exercises are constantly reviewed and the current regulations were in place during this exercise.</P>
      <P>These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills.</P>
      <P>Should the findings of the court of inquiry indicate that any changes are called for in the interests of safety, these will be implemented.</P>

      <P>A daily overseas allowance, the current rates of which range from £16.95 to £23.29 per day depending upon rank, is payable to officers and non-commissioned personnel of the Permanent Defence Force serving with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).  The same rate is payable to all personnel irrespective of <Col N="1628" /> marital status or whether the individual is accompanied or unaccompanied.  An accompanied allowance is not payable to Permanent Defence Force personnel serving with the mission.</P>
      <P>Defence Force personnel serve with two distinct groups of the UNFICYP mission in Cyprus, namely (i) Headquarters Staff, members of which may be accommodated locally, and (ii) Camp Command Component, an armed unit whose members are required by the United Nations to live on base and are provided with both accommodation and food.  Headquarters Staff personnel may be accompanied by their families and may receive travel, educational and rent allowances, as appropriate, if accompanied by their families to the mission area.  In such instances 75 per cent of vouched cost of accommodation may be reimbursed to officers and non-commissioned officers who are married and accompanied by their families on the mission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 77, 87 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The current number of members in Civil Defence is approximately 10,000.  The activities undertaken by Civil Defence are based on the objectives set out in the Towards 2000 programme which is focused on community help and support.  In this regard, Civil Defence has evolved over the years into a skilled community support organisation which provides essential assistance to a wide range of primary emergency services, which include the Garda Síochana, fire, ambulance and search and rescue services as well as the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> Essential activities undertaken by Civil Defence include response to natural and environmental emergencies such as flooding or blizzards; search and rescue; river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; forest fire fighting; responding to radiological emergencies; stewarding at local and national events; responding in the event of requests for overseas assistance;</P>
    <P>The Towards 2000 programme contains provisions for the involvement of the organisation in major emergencies and a considerable part of training is geared towards this role.</P>
    <P>The major emergency plan is the combined co-ordinated plans of the local authority, health board and gardaí in the area where the emergency occurs.  There is provision in the major emergency plan for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces both at local and national level.</P>
    <P>I recently had the opportunity to witness at first hand the level of commitment and training which is undertaken by Civil Defence members throughout the country when I visited the locations of Meitheal '98, the Civil Defence national exercise day.  These exercises took place in Counties Laois, Wexford and Cavan/Monaghan on Saturday, 4 April last and I take the opportunity to place on record my personal appreciation and respect, and that of the Government, for the level of commitment and expertise which the members of Civil Defence, who all act in a voluntary capacity, provide to the community in times of essential need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces which was submitted to the Efficiency Audit Group in 1993. Arising from this report, the Efficiency Audit Group made certain recommendations to the Government which were accepted in July 1995. Following this, an implementation group was set up to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for the first three year phase of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  In February 1996 the Government accepted the Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98.  It is this plan, rather than the Price Waterhouse report, that is setting the agenda for the ongoing Defence Forces reorganisation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated on many occasions, both by me and by previous Ministers for Defence, that no barrack closures will take place during the first phase of the plan, and this remains the situation. <Col N="1630" /> The implementation plan provides for a study of military accommodation to be undertaken at the end of phase one.  It is acknowledged that this question is sensitive and will need careful study from a number of perspectives.  In particular, full account must be taken of the economic and social implications of any proposal.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996.  These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place, that is, in May of this year.</P>

This figure includes 660 personnel who are serving with the United Nations; 51 personnel with the UN authorised Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFOR; 12 personnel with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE; and ten personnel with the European Community Monitor Mission, ECMM, to the former Yugoslavia.  There is, in addition, one officer attached to each of the following: the Irish Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, the Irish Permanent Representation to the OSCE in Vienna and Ireland's Observer Delegation to the Western European Union, Western European Union, in Brussels.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of contributing additional Defence Forces troops to overseas missions the position is that the level of participation on overseas missions is kept under continual review in order to ensure that security needs at home can be met at all times and that the cost to the Defence Vote does not become excessive. There are no requests at present to contribute to any new missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton has asked me to report <Col N="1634" /> on my recent visits to Lebanon and Bosnia.  I have already reported to the House on my recent visit to Irish troops serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in my reply to Priority Question No. 19 today and I would refer the Deputy to that report.</P>
    <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the Stabilisation Force, SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 15 to 17 April 1998.  While in the region, I also met with members of the Defence Forces serving with the European Community Monitor Mission to the Former Yugoslavia, ECMM, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE, and members of the Garda Síochána serving with the UN International Police Task Force.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.  I was extremely impressed by the professionalism of the Irish personnel serving abroad as well as the effectiveness of the various missions.  During my trip to Bosnia I also had meetings with General Shinseki, Commander of SFOR, Ambassador Streams, Head of Mission ECMM, Ambassador Barry, Head of Mission OSCE and Mr. Carlos Westendorp, High Representative.</P>
    <P>The SFOR mandate will expire in June 1998. It is expected that the UN Security Council will shortly approve a follow on force similar in size and mandate to the existing SFOR.  Subject to the terms of the relevant UN Security Council Resolution in this regard, Ireland will shortly consider the question of continuing participation in this mission after June this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 72, 73, 75, 88, 97, 110 and 118.  together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from recent allegations of harassment of Irish fishing vessels off the south west coast, I had a meeting on 8 April 1998 with my colleague the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  At that meeting measures were agreed which are aimed at ensuring an effective <Col N="1637" /> and rapid response to any incidents involving harassment or endangerment of fishing vessels.  To this end, it was decided that the Irish Marine Emergency Service IMES, will be the first point of contact for fishermen when an incident occurs. IMES will immediately contact the Naval Service and Air Corps and the appropriate resources will then be deployed to effect a response so that a deterrent presence is on the scene as quickly as possible.  I understand that a marine notice on these arrangements is being prepared.</P>
    <P>It was agreed also that officials will review, as a matter of urgency, with the Office of the Attorney General, the adequacy of the existing powers of the State under fisheries, maritime safety and international legal codes in respect of incidents of this nature, which usually occur outside Irish territorial waters.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is also seeking the active co-operation of other member states in ensuring the highest standards of behaviour on fishing grounds and in promoting the avoidance of conflict between fishermen operating on the same fishing grounds with different types of gear.  The aim will be the putting in place of codes of practice between the fishermen of the member states concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of manning levels for the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  It is intended that there will be an intake of 50 recruits to the service this year.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At present six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel, FPPV, which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 100 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure it was found necessary to curtail annual training for members of the Reserve Defence Force having regard to the provisions in the Defence Vote for the training of the reserve.</P>
      <P>There is no plan to increase the provision in the Defence Vote in 1999 to cater for two weeks annual training for the reserve.  The provision in the Defence Vote 1997 provided for 63,000 man days to be used in seven day periods of annual training, 14 day courses of instruction and casual security duties.  There is no change in the position for 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the total number of man days used in 1997 was 61,242 of which 1,095 days were used in the performance of casual security duties by members of the FCA. I am further advised that the shortfall in usage of man days arises from the fact that members are not always in a position to attend for annual training or courses of instruction.  Recruitment to <Col N="1639" /> the FCA and An Slua Muirí is continuous and is permitted to the extent necessary to replace wastage.</P>
    <P>A study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the First Line Reserve, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, is taking place at present.  The study will be wide-ranging and will include an examination of reserve training needs.  Pending the completion of the study I do not intend to take any action that could be regarded in any way as pre-empting the findings and recommendations of the steering group that I set up to oversee the study.</P>
    <P>Membership of the FCA and Slua Muirí is voluntary and the members devote a considerable amount of their spare time to the community through the medium of part-time military service. Their dedication and enthusiasm is recognised and valued in local communities throughout the country and at national level by the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99, 111, 135 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the questions, the survey in question was carried out on behalf of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and as such the results which were obtained are essentially a matter for the association. RACO has, however, done me the courtesy of drawing the survey results to my attention.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are going through an enormous reform process, the need for which is accepted by all.  The current restructuring programme cuts across all areas of military life and there will inevitably be major changes as the new organisation takes place.  While I believe that the implementation plan is essentially sound, a degree of change such as this naturally engenders a certain degree of anxiety while the organisation is in transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of RACO occupy the senior and middle management ranks of the Defence Forces <Col N="1642" /> and they have a right and duty to be concerned about the morale and image of their organisation. I am concerned that comments in the media regarding claims for hearing damage should not take away from the well deserved reputation of members of the Defence Forces who have served the State so well over the years.</P>
    <P>I might add that I have recently returned from a visit to Irish troops serving in the former Yugoslavia and that I had an excellent trip to the UNIFIL area of operations last month.  Everywhere, the military personnel to whom I spoke were highly motivated and in excellent spirits. The troops are doing a wonderful job and the atmosphere in the mission areas is very positive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 139 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal <Col N="1644" /> importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.  In 1996 the Naval Service carried out five major drugs operations and these were co-ordinated with the joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service.  My Department does not have information in relation to the numbers that resulted in court appearances as the prosecution of personnel involved in such activities is a matter for the Garda.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving the prevention of illegal drug importation. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the joint task force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  It is intended that there will be an intake of 50 recruits to the service this year.</P>
    <P>As part of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 a special study of the Naval Service was undertaken by consultants engaged by the efficiency audit group &mdash; EAG. The consultants completed their review earlier this year and recently submitted their final report to the EAG.  The report is currently being considered by the steering group overseeing the review, following which it will be submitted to Government.</P>

      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At any one time there would generally <Col N="1645" /> be three or four vessels on patrol.  The question of resources in terms of the personnel and equipment required by the Naval Service to enable it to fulfil its role is kept under continual review.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel (FPPV) which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
      <P>A competition to recruit ten watchkeeping officers to the executive branch of the Naval Service was advertised last March in the national press and in a number of relevant publications in Britain.  The advertising of these vacancies in publications outside the State is not unusual given the nature of the posts being filled and the qualifications required.  It is likely that a number of professionally qualified candidates who would be interested in these positions may be resident and employed outside Ireland and it is therefore desirable to make such potential candidates aware of the vacancies in question.</P>

      <P>The grading of keenness of hearing within the Defence Forces medical classification system is designed primarily for the purpose of diagnosing and classifying any hearing impairment to facilitate the implementation of an appropriate care of hearing programme.  Screening audiometry is conducted in accordance with the methods and parameters prescribed in the Health and Safety Authority's &ldquo;Guidelines on Hearing Checks and Audiometry&rdquo; issued pursuant to the (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations 1990 (S.  I. No. 157 of 1990) and requires unaided air conduction audiometry.  The use of hearing aids would defeat its stated purpose and in any case the minimum standard of keenness of hearing required for retention in the Defence Forces is related to hearing loss in the lower tones which are related to the ability to hear verbal sounds. The provision of high tone or microchip tone-specific aids, still in their early stage of development, would be of no value.  Under the Defence Force regulations, no one suffering from high tone loss alone would be discharged from the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

A number of very constructive meetings with the association have already been held and another meeting will be arranged shortly.  In the course of the review which is now under way, the official side will be as anxious as PDFORRA to reach a conclusion which is acceptable to all sides, and many of the concerns of the association can be addressed in a constructive manner.  These discussions are taking place under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  As agreed with the associations, the scheme provides that discussions taking place under it are confidential to the parties involved.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate, therefore, for me to comment in detail on the issues under discussion.</P>

      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and in providing new and up-graded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces.  Some of the more important developments in relation to the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are: a new fishery patrol vessel due for delivery in 1999; the supply of new turrets and fire directing systems for fitting, during 1998 and 1999, to existing armoured cars; the purchase of refurbished 105mm.  light artillery guns, for delivery in 1998, to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete; delivery of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of nearly £10 million; expenditure of approximately £3 million on new troop carrying vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of procuring armoured personnel carriers is under consideration in my Department at present.  A project team was established in 1997 comprising civilian and military personnel and was tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs <Col N="1647" /> involved.  The procurement process will be undertaken in two stages by way of a competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.  In stage one a general request for proposals &mdash; RFP &mdash; will issue to interested companies, based on a broad-parameter specification.  This will establish product availability in the market place as well as an indication of the costs involved.  I expect that documentation relating to this stage will issue in the next few days.  In the second stage a request for tenders &mdash; RFT &mdash; based on a more precisely defined specification, will issue to a restricted list of companies &mdash; those deemed successful in the first stage.  The project team, already in place, will manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Requests for participation by the Defence Forces in international peacekeeping missions are considered on their merits by the Government on a case by case basis.  Where a decision is taken to respond to any such request the military unit concerned will be provided with the equipment necessary for the carrying out of its mission.  The Defence Forces are currently participating in a number of overseas missions involving a total of 750 personnel and troops serving on such missions are provided with adequate resources to carry out their tasks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> In October 1997, the Chief of Staff established a military review board to conduct a special study of the Reserve Defence Force. This board is required to consult with a consultative group made up of members of the Reserve Defence Force.  The members of this consultative group comprise commissioned and non-commissioned officers from the four Commands and from the Slua Muirí.  Normally, this board meets once weekly, and to date it has held over 22 meetings.</P>
    <P>The joint military-civilian steering group which I set up recently to oversee the study of the Reserve Defence Force has held four meetings to date.  The membership of the group comprises an independent chairman, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants from my Department and a serving FCA officer.  I am satisfied with the composition of the steering group and can see no requirement for the addition of a second FCA officer.  The military board is required to consult with a consultative group made up of commissioned and non-commissioned reserve officers from the four Commands and from the Slua Muirí.  The views of the members of the Reserve on its future organisation and structure have been sought and submissions from them have been invited.</P>
    <P>The steering group has invited the three Defence Force representative associations &mdash; RACO, PDFORRA and RDFRA &mdash; to make presentations to it, and I understand that these will take place over the next couple of months. Consequently, I am satisfied that members of the Reserve Defence Force, and their representative association are being consulted adequately during the review process.  The study of the reserve will be wide-ranging and will examine such matters as the appropriate strengths of the various elements, equipment, training, etc.  Pending the completion of the study I do not intend to take any action in the meantime that would in any way pre-empt the recommendations of the steering group. Although I have not specified any deadlines in the steering group's terms of reference for the submission of an interim or final report I am confident that the group will conduct the study as quickly as possible and submit its recommendations at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, RACO and PDFORRA operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is accepted that such systems have traditionally been adversarial in nature and did not lend themselves easily to the management of change.  The Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness advocates building more open, co-operative processes on existing arrangements. In the context of both the process of re-organisation of the Defence Forces and the Partnership 2000 I have asked the Secretary General of the Department to develop proposals on providing a forum in which to develop joint ownership of change.  Such structures would complement the existing conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of engaging outside specialist assistance in this area is being considered in conjunction with the representative associations. Consideration is also being given to partnership structures for RACO and PDFORRA and I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of those processes. In general however employment relationships can be very much improved by an acceptance by both sides that substantial support of each other is necessary to make progress.  Both sides must also accept that each has a legitimate role and interest in the organisation.  Such steps should lead to higher levels of mutual respect for and trust in each others positions.  This approach has already been warmly welcomed by PDFORRA representatives who regard it as a major breakthrough.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring in this instance to needs of women in the home in so far as they are seeking to re-enter the labour market.  The Government in its Programme, and Action Programme for the Millennium, is committed to ensuring that opportunities will be made available to women in the home to undertake training in order to return to work.  In this regard it should be clearly understood that all training courses run by FÁS &mdash; the training and employment authority &mdash; are open to every person who is unemployed and seeking employment regardless of gender, though preference is given to people on the live register.</P>
      <P>FÁS has been endeavouring through its Action Programme for Women to increase the level of female participation on all FÁS programmes.  The focus of the agency's strategy has been to promote womens participation in the full range of specific skills training courses, the largest programme run by FÁS, by targeting places in non-traditional and new technology courses in which there has been little or no previous representation by women.  A number of innovative and flexible approaches to training have been undertaken, including flexibility of hours of attendance and multi-media delivery of training.  Both the latter innovations are particularly suitable to the training needs of women in the home.  In 1997, 5,171 women completed specific skills training courses with FÁS.  This represented 44 per cent of the total number of people completing such training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS also provides courses such as Return to Work and Enterprise Training which has a high proportion of women participants, particularly home-makers.  In addition to the standard return to work course FÁS has developed and implemented a pilot project which delivers return to work training and guidance services in a more flexible manner.  In 1997, 536 women of the 1,694 who participated in the return to work programme participated in this pilot project. <Col N="1653" /> FÁS is also very conscious of the need for child care facilities for women returning to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community-based child care provision by way of support for community employment projects. Approximately 130 community employment projects have such a child care dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community-based child care for women undertaking training or education.</P>
    <P>Through its action programme, FÁS has continually sought more and better ways of meeting women's training and employment needs and the fact that the number of women participating on FÁS training programmes as a percentage of total participation is increasing at 43.4 per cent shows that its efforts are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>Finally, a working group chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is now looking at the issue of womens access to labour market opportunities and should report to the Government in mid-1998.  The working group includes social partner representation, including the National Womens Council of Ireland.  The groups recommendations should help the Government plan its strategy for the integration of women into all forms of training and employment.</P>

      <P>Some £3 million was expended under the Department's Vote in 1997 on the capital development of fishery harbours, the bulk of this expenditure related to capital works at the five fishery harbour centres and other major fishery harbours around the country.  The remainder of the expenditure was incurred on minor harbours and aquaculture landing places.  Of this, £29,643 was made available to Mayo County Council for the improvement and upgrading of harbours and landing facilities.</P>

      <P>I met the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland and other angling representatives from the west together with the Deputy and other interested colleagues on 1 April last to discuss the Western Lakes project.  As I explained at the meeting, the application for a further tranche of funding for the Western Lakes Project under the tourism angling measure was being evaluated together with all project applications on hand by the TAM management committee in the context of a general review of the efficiency, effectiveness and value for money of expenditure under the tourism angling measure as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the TAM management committee have now completed their review.  I will announce today a further round of investment approvals for tourism angling projects right around the country, including the final phase of the Western Lakes project which will receive a further £800,000, bringing to £2 million the total EU and State investment in this important project to date.  I am satisfied that this funding will enable the Western Regional Fisheries Board to complete all the key components of its development programme.</P>

      <P>Part XIV of Defence Force regulations R.5 &mdash; An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil &mdash; prescribes the procedures for completing annual confidential reports which are completed by unit commanders in respect of officers serving in their units.  The reporting officer is determined by virtue of his appointment rather than his rank.  The award to an officer of an unsatisfactory annual confidential report does not adversely affect his seniority in his current rank.  Defence Force regulations R.5 also prescribe that the qualifications normally required for the promotion of officers shall be as laid down in training instructions issued by the general staff. Accordingly, the Adjutant-General's training instruction 33/74 sets out the eligibility criteria for promotion of FCA officers.  Different criteria apply in respect of promotion from one rank to the next higher rank.  The promotion of an officer is also subject to the existence of a vacancy in the next higher rank in the unit in which he is to be promoted.</P>

      <P>The ewe premium is designed to compensate producers for the difference between the EU basic price and the average EU market price for sheepmeat.  In view of this, it is inevitable that the rate of the ewe premium will be lower in a year, such as 1997, when average market prices are high, than in a year such as 1995, when prices were at relatively low levels.  In effect, the position is that when the ewe premium and average market prices are taken together, overall returns to sheep producers in 1997 were over 1 per cent greater than in 1995.</P>

      <P>An organic farming unit was set up in my Department in 1990 to help to develop organic farming.  Since then my Department has supported <Col N="1660" /> a number of initiatives to support the organic sector.  At present funding for organic farming is available through the REP scheme, where £1.88 million has been paid to farmers in REPS who participate in a measure to undertake organic farming; a scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99.  This scheme provides financial assistance in respect of approved investments as follows: aid to farmers, groups, companies or co-operatives for the provision of grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce.  Grant aid is at the rate of 5 per cent subject to a maximum investment of £70,000; aid to recognised bodies for the marketing and promotion of organic farming.  Grant aid is at the rate of 70 per cent subject to a maximum investment of £30,000 per year.  To date under this scheme funding totalling £183,000 has been provided to 27 applicants.</P>
      <P>Funding has also been provided on an annual basis since 1993, to the three private organic inspection bodies &mdash; Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association Ltd., Organic Trust Ltd., and Demeter Standards Ltd &mdash; towards inspections carried out by them under the EEC regulation on organic farming of crop products.  The measures, implemented by my Department, have encouraged more farmers to convert to organic farming practices and assisted the marketing of organic produce.  It is likely that the demand for organically produced food will continue to grow in the future and I am confident that with the supports available from my Department this demand will be met by our own producers.</P>

      <P>According to Land Commission records the undivided moiety referred to in the question formed part of a large re-arrangement scheme operated by the Land Commission in 1961.  The moiety was vested by the Land Commission on 20 May 1969 in the name of the individual's predecessor in title and was subsequently registered on the folio now held in the name of the individual. It is assumed, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to registration of the remaining undivided moiety which does not seem to have involved the Land Commission.  Registration of this moiety would appear to be a private matter and is one in which the individual should consider consulting his solicitor.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The REPS appeal arrangements were put in place after consultation with the Attorney General's office, in relation to the imposition of penalties as a result of compliance inspections.</P>
      <P>The committee currently comprises Mr. Matt Sinnott, senior inspector, general agriculture policy and evaluation group, Mr. Liam Brady, regional inspector, rural development and environment group and Mr. Seamus Fogarty, assistant principal, agricultural structures II.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sinnott was appointed as chairman to the committee following his promotion to senior inspector in December 1997.  He had previously been responsible for area aid in the integrated control group.  Mr. Brady is regional inspector for the east midlands region since August 1996.  Mr. Fogarty has worked in structures division II dealing with REPS matters over the last three years.</P>
      <P>The committee operates independently of other Department officials involved with the operation of REPS at local level.  The current REPS review system involves an on-farm inspection by the local regional inspector or an inspector with a professional qualification in agriculture on behalf of the regional inspector.  The inspector' s report is submitted to the REPS appeals committee along with all other relevant papers for a review of the decision taken at local level. I am satisfied that the committee operates in an independent manner and I intend to continue with the operation of the committee in its present format.  Under the charter of rights an appeals procedure has been established to deal with premia and headage schemes which include the right of an oral hearing.  The current REPS appeals committee was set up later to provide a separate independent appeals mechanism for farmers.</P>
      <P>There have been no oral hearings by the REPS appeals committee to date.</P>

      <P>The granting of a herd number is based <Col N="1664" /> solely on the interests of disease control and is an administrative arrangement for the purpose of testing cattle.  Among the criteria for granting a herd number are that the applicant must have separate facilities, the herd must be managed at all times as a separate unit, that is separate farm equipment, housing, fodder, management and without intermixing with animals from other herds.  In particular circumstances relevant documentation is sought from a prospective herdowner in evaluating any application for a herd number.</P>
      <P>The disease control regulations which are in the interests of our animal health status are applied without discrimination in the interests of all herdowners.  I am satisfied that the arrangements for granting of herd numbers is in accordance with equality and other legislation.</P>

      <P>The concept of equal opportunities for men and women is one which I favour very much and in relation to which, both myself and my Department have a very good track record.  That said it is a concept which does not always lend itself to practical application.  In this particular case the nature of the task to be undertaken by the Food Industry Development Group dictated that its membership comprise senior management personnel from a representative number of food companies, relevant State agencies and industry and consumer organisations.</P>

      <P>The person named is not the applicant for grants.  The herd number in question was transferred from the person named on 20 November 1997.  The new registered owner of the herd number has received his full entitlement under the 1997 sheep headage scheme, ewe premium scheme, cattle headage scheme and EU suckler cow premium scheme.  The registered herd owner applied on five cows under the 1997 cattle headage and EU suckler cow premium schemes.  At an inspection carried out on 7 August 1997 four cows were presented and one cow was absent.  In accordance with clause 28 of the terms and conditions of the cattle headage scheme, and clause 27 of the terms and conditions of the EU suckler cow premium scheme, a shortfall penalty of 20 per cent was applied to the headage and premium grants payable on the eligible animals.  The applicant was informed by my Department on 6 January 1998 that he would be receiving reduced payments under both schemes. He was also advised that if he wished to appeal this decision he should write to my Department setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case.  No such appeal however was received by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Irish Seed Savers' Association is a member of the Irish Genetic Resources Conservation Trust which is represented on the Advisory Committee on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.  This committee was established in 1996 to advise on agricultural genetic resources conservation and on measures to preserve such resources where their survival is being threatened or endangered.</P>
      <P>I have provided £70,000 in my Department's Vote for 1998 to support projects from bodies, including non-governmental organisations, in the identification and collection of native agricultural genetic resources as part of collaborative programmes to save these resources for posterity. Funding has already been provided to the association in 1996 and 1997 for its activities in the identification and collection of old Irish apple cultivars for the Lamb Clarke Apple collection at UCD and for identification and acquisition of indigenous varieties of cereals and their propagation with a view to utilisation and storage in gene-banks.  My Department is presently considering applications received from the Irish Genetic Resources Conservation Trust on behalf of the association to continue its work on the acquisition and propagation of cereal varieties and on brassicas.</P>
      <P>EU Directives on the marketing of seeds require that seeds must be of a certain quality standard and be of varieties represented on either the national or common catalogues of varieties. Proposals to amend these Directives are currently being considered and will support provisions for conservation of genetic resources.  I am following these proposals carefully and I will support arrangements which ensure the availability of seed for growing for the purpose of conservation of our indigenous genetic resources.</P>

      <Quest>the situation regarding the maximum amount of mortgage relief which can be claimed by a separated person who has acquired a new family home and new legal mortgage in her own name rather than the original mortgage which was in joint names; if a separated person should be treated as a widow or widower or at least allowed 100 per cent relief for the first year of the new mortgage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 244 Taxes Consolidated Act, 1997 provides for the granting of interest relief on certain home loans.  A separated person who previously held a mortgage or a joint mortgage, and who subsequently obtains a new mortgage in his or her own name, to purchase a family home which is his or her principal place of residence, will qualify for interest relief subject to the limits, reductions and deductions applicable to that of a single person.</P>
      <P>As regards the first five years of claiming mortgage relief a separated or single person is entitled to relief of 100 per cent of mortgage interest subject to a limit of £2,500 per annum.  In all other cases a single or separated person is entitled to relief of 80 per cent of mortgage interest, subject to a limit of £2,500, less a <i>de minimus</i> of £100. This means that for such a separated or single person the maximum amount of mortgage interest relief allowable is £1,900.</P>
      <P>Where individuals separate and acquire a new residence, and the first time buyers' relief five year span has not expired, the remaining unutilised years can be used for the purposes of determining the appropriate limits.  This means that separated persons can benefit from the 100 per cent relief for the first year of the new mortgage, provided the separation takes place within five years of first claiming mortgage interest relief.  I do not envisage making any changes to the method of calculating mortgage interest relief which will impact on the situation to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance, and double rate bands, is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an (unmarried) cohabiting couple. This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>The full year cost of extending the free travel scheme, as requested by the Deputy, is estimated at £1.4 million.  Any additional expenditure along these lines could only be examined in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks of each year.  An additional £3 per week smokeless fuel <Col N="1674" /> allowance is payable during the heating season to fuel recipients in Dublin and Cork.  This extra allowance is to assist recipients in meeting the increased costs of buying smokeless fuel in urban areas where there is a ban on the sale of bituminous coal for environmental reasons.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>During the fuel season which has just ended, temperatures were above average in each month from October to March, significantly so in February and March.  Temperatures did drop in April but have now risen again.  The estimated cost of extending the fuel season to the end of April would be £5.4 million.  This could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national fuel scheme there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under that scheme a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
      <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP.  The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died in September 1984, first applied for a widow's contributory pension in May 1995.  She was awarded a pension with effect from 11 November 1994, the maximum late claim <Col N="1675" /> backdating period permissible under the legislation then in force.</P>
      <P>Payment outside the statutory time limit could only be made at that time in very specific and exceptional circumstances, such as in cases of exceptional hardship, departmental error or where persons were so incapacitated that they were unable to make a claim within the specified maximum time period.</P>
      <P>In the light of information subsequently supplied, it was decided in October 1996 to backdate the date of award of widow's contributory pension to 14 September 1984, to the first pension payment date following the date of death of her husband.  This decision was taken on the basis that, on the balance of probability, the person concerned received information from the Department at the time of her husband's death that resulted in her not claiming at that time.</P>
      <P>Arrears for the period from 14 September 1984 to 24 October 1996 inclusive, totalling £44,464.70, were issued by the Department to the person concerned in November 1996.  An additional payment of £7,357.76 was issued to her that month, in compensation to her for the loss of purchasing power over the period for which the pension arrears payment was applicable.  No court action was involved in settling this matter.</P>
      <P>In August 1997 the person concerned wrote to the Department requesting payment of legal fees in the amount of £1,997.50. She was advised in October 1997 that any legal fees arising were a matter between herself and her solicitor in respect of professional services provided to her at her request and she was also informed that the Department had discharged its full liabilities to her.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which his Department will deliver on the constitutional guarantee to a primary education for all severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children if access to education is dependent on boards of management of primary schools making application to his Department on behalf of such children and where there is no obligation on boards of management to make such an application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 214, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The most recent data available to my Department indicates that there are 1,289 children with a severe or profound mental handicap between the ages of four and 19 years.  This data is taken from the intellectual disability database maintained by the health authorities.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the parents of each individual child to decide whether they wish to avail of the formal education service offered by my Department. In some instances parents choose for clinical or other reasons not to avail of a formal education service.  My Department is prepared to respond positively to any request for the provision of an education service for children with severe-profound mental handicap.  My Department is also in close contact with the service providers in relation to these cases.</P>
      <P>There are 78 special classes for children with severe-profound mental handicap.  These classes provide an education service to approximately 460 pupils.  A number of applications for the establishment of additional classes for such children are being pursued by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are two High Court cases pending against the State in relation to educational provision for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.  I am not in a position at this stage to indicate the likely costs of these cases. Both are at a preliminary stage and have not come before a full hearing of the court.  Nor would it be a useful exercise to speculate as to the potential, generally, for claims for damages against the State on behalf of children with severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science I am committed to ensuring that the constitutional rights to education of all children, including children with a severe-profound handicap, are given practical effect.  I am also obliged to have regard to the constitutional rights of parents as the primary educators and carers of their children and to the physical capacities and, sometimes, the medical needs of the children concerned.  The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, as published contains <Col N="1682" /> statutory safeguards for the rights of children with disabilities.  In particular, on the enactment of the Bill, boards of management will have a statutory duty to ensure that the educational needs of children with special needs are provided for; they will be required to have, and make publicly available, their admissions policies and there will be structures for appeal by parents.  Following publication of the Bill, I and officials of my Department have had consultations with a wide range of interests in education, including parents of severely and profoundly handicapped children. I am considering proposals for amendment of the Bill in Committee to clarify areas of concern to such parents, to address, as far as practicable, their concerns and to further strengthen the rights of their children.</P>

      <Quest>the special training, if any, available to student teachers or serving teachers at primary level who wish to pursue a career in special education; if so, where this training is available; the number of places available in 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The colleges of education provide training modules for student teachers in the area of special education in varying ways.  The modules provided are general in nature and are not intended as a specific preparation for a career in special education.  It has been the policy up to now that, as a rule, teachers who opt for special education should do so subsequent to their basic training and only after experience in the mainstream classroom.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently, I intend to appoint a representative group in the near future to conduct a major review of pre-service education.  The terms of reference for that group will include the consideration of course content.  I will be asking the group to report within six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Training in the special education area is provided for serving teachers in a number of ways, viz. a diploma course in special education is provided in St. Patrick's College of Education.  There are 25 teachers on this course in the academic year 1997-98.  It is expected that there will be a similar number of participants in 1998-99.  The course is open to teachers who have satisfactorily completed their probationary period and have at least three years' teaching service, of which at least one year must have been in the area of special education.  An induction course for teachers new to the area of severe and profound disabilities will be held in the autumn.  Expected attendance is 35.  Funding will be provided for summer courses this year for teachers of children with autism and for teachers of children with severe <Col N="1683" /> and profound disabilities.  Expected attendance is 80.  Various other courses are provided through education centres in response to identified local needs.  A range of courses on specific areas are approved and funded on the basis of proposals from teachers, schools and other interested parties.  Funding is provided for various other initiatives, including distance education postgraduate courses for teachers of partially sighted and blind children University of Birmingham; and for a course for principals of schools where units for children with severe and profound disabilities are located.</P>
    <P>The staffing in the Special Education Department in St. Patrick's College of Education has recently been increased.  This will further enhance the provision by the college of in-career development courses for teachers in Special Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Information relating to the number of places on training courses is indicated above in each case where the information is available.</P>
