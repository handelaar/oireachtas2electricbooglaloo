      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Sargent.  I now call on Deputy Sargent to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to the terms of Standing Order 31, I request leave to move a motion to adjourn the House to allow the Government to respond to reports that the Tribunal of Inquiry into Planning Irregularities may be stymied by legal challenges and to give a commitment that it will bring forward the necessary legislation to prevent the tribunal being hampered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. c5, Supplementary Estimates [Votes 19, 20 and 21] and No. 2 the Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. c5 [Votes 19, 20 and 21] shall be moved together and shall be decided without debate by one question and that any division demanded on No. c5 shall be taken forthwith; and any division demanded on No. 2 shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday 10 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. c5 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Whip agreed yesterday to take that item without debate. However, since then we have looked at the matter in greater detail.  I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told the select <Col N="246" /> committee in June that a Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary.  I can give the precise reference to the Taoiseach if necessary, it was in response to a question from Deputy McManus. The Minister said a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda pay award would not be necessary whereas now we have been told it is necessary. The Minister does not seem to have a complete grip on the financial implications of the decision. I would be grateful if before we take this item without debate the Taoiseach tells us why the Minister said a Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume at that time the Department felt it had adequate resources under that Vote subhead.  Obviously during the year the demands on the Garda overtime bill increased, particularly during August and September.  A number of units which were taken off Border patrol were redeployed on 15 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the pay award is £23 million which is not small change which might be lost in the calculation of overtime.  It is a substantial sum.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave the impression in June that it could be taken from a contingency fund in the Department of Finance. We need to know what is happening to this fund if it is not available for this purpose as the Minister anticipated.  This information is essential to the Opposition in assessing the budget.  What is the explanation for this?  I appreciate the Taoiseach was given little or no notice of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>None, this is the first we have heard of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my wish to put him in a position where he has to answer questions which he cannot answer.  It may be better if the Supplementary Estimate is taken next week so our questions can be fully answered before it is dealt with.  I will not press for a debate if we can get satisfactory answers as to why the Minister has changed his position on this substantial sum and on where it will come from.  It is not small change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only decision to be made is to pass the Estimate which then goes to the committee.  If the Deputy allows this all the information on it will be given then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this matter has been debated in committee.  The Minister was not able to give answers there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to debate it, I am trying to get information.  The Minister was not able to answer the question as to where the <Col N="247" /> £53 million is now.  It did not require a Supplementary Estimate in June yet now it does.  He did not answer that question in committee and this is the last chance the House will have to debate the matter or get an answer.  It would be inappropriate to take this item without debate as proposed unless the answer is forthcoming, which it clearly is not.  I do not blame the Taoiseach for not having this information, although it would be desirable if he had.  Perhaps it would be better if the Supplementary Estimates are taken next week so the Taoiseach, or whoever, can provide this information to the public and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate this matter.  I must put the proposal to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton.  We do not necessarily need a debate on this matter but we need an explanation to facilitate the movement of the Estimate through the House.  Three or four days delay will make no difference and the item can be taken without debate next week. There is a conflict between what was said last June and the current position.  Will the Taoiseach consider the deferral of the Garda pay Estimate so that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or somebody on behalf of the Government can give an indication why there is a conflict between what was said last June and what is being said now.  The matter can then be decided by the Whips and it can be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done either way.  I assume no one is opposed in principle to providing the money.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can give the information &mdash; we can either pass the Estimate today and the Minister can give it now, or we can defer it until Tuesday and the Minister can give it to the spokespersons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The information should be given in the House when the matter is being taken without debate, by agreement.  I suggest it should be done next Tuesday.  It should be given in the House because it is public information &mdash; it is not private to spokespersons, however eminent they may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach withdrawing the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we give the information in the House, the matter will not be taken without debate &mdash; we will have a statement from the Minister.  The idea is that these Votes should be passed without debate after being discussed in select committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Taoiseach the question, as usual he will give a concise answer <Col N="248" /> lasting no more than two sentences, and we will all be happy, presuming there is an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is an answer, we are not spending £53 million for no reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the answer should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I both know the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure was required to pay overtime to staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but that is not the answer to my question.  I asked why we did not need a Supplementary Estimate in June but we need one now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach withdrawing the item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do so but I do not accept we require a debate on it.  The answer is that this expenditure is needed to pay the Garda Síochána this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is answering a question but that is not the question I asked.  If it was answered we would not need a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify the position, since I was the person who raised this both on the Estimate debate in the select committee and on the Supplementary Estimate?  I wanted to know whether the Minister intended to introduce a Supplementary Estimate when a deal was struck with the gardaí, and I was informed there was a contingency fund in the Department of Finance which would provide for the outcome.  Subsequently a Supplementary Estimate was rushed through&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into detail on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach stands over what he said, I would be fearful he might mislead the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but I will refer to the Whips the question of how to pass on the information. Every time we agree a Supplementary Estimate I can foresee a tactic whereby someone will state he or she does not have that information. I therefore withdraw the proposal but not on the basis that it will be taken in the House.  If Deputy Bruton wants a debate on this Supplementary <Col N="249" /> Estimate I will agree to change the procedure and debate all Supplementary Estimates in the House, but I will not agree to withdraw the proposal on the basis that we debate it next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Estimate is moved without debate next week, I propose that a concise statement be made by the Minister, with no right of reply or question from any other Member. That would meet the requirements of the House; £53 million is a substantial sum and the Minister should give an explanation for it when he moves the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem would not have arisen if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had known the answer to the question he was asked at the select committee.  The Government wants the Estimate passed without debate today, and the Taoiseach is not able to answer the question either.  If the previous Minister for Justice had not been able to answer a question like that, we would have heard a hue and cry from the assembled masses opposite.</P>

      <P>Arising from the pertinent motion proposed by Deputy Sargent, will the Taoiseach consider within the next week whether an amendment is required to the terms of reference of the appropriate tribunal to remedy any deficiencies which exist?  I do not expect that this matter is ready for decision now, but I ask the Taoiseach to turn his attention to the possible delays to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 21 October, the House agreed unanimously a motion which would, <i>inter alia</i>, require legislation to amend the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges, and Immunities of Witnesses) Act and other related matters to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to inquire into the allegations of wrongdoing in AIB and the DIRT tax controversy.  When will that legislation be presented to the House by the Government?</P>
      <P>In today's newspapers the Taoiseach is reported to have addressed the NESF on a new method of payment for public servants which would involve performance related pay.  Will this require legislation?  If so, has work commenced on drafting it and when will we see it?</P>

      <P>On the first question, I answered Deputy De Rossa on this matter yesterday. There has been contact between the Attorney General and the legal team of the Committee of Public Accounts as to the best way to bring this issue forward, and they have agreed on what issues they should address.  I do not have a date on which they will have legislation ready.</P>

      <P>I have no date but I understand they agreed on what should be done and it will be dealt with urgently by the Attorney General.  As soon as I get a date I will give it to the House.  On the second issue, there is no legislation at this stage.  Following what I told the social partners in July, I told the first meeting of the NESC yesterday that this issue must be addressed.</P>

On another European matter, what progress is being made to protect duty free sales?  There is a major demonstration in Brussels today to protect duty free jobs.

It appears the promised legislation to allow the inquiry into Allied Irish Banks to go ahead is suffering from serious slippage.  The issue here is the capacity of the House to conduct this investigation, as distinct from a tribunal, and if the matter cannot be attended to in this session it puts seriously at risk our ability to do so.  In the early days of this controversy the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the House that the legislation would be introduced as a first priority of Government. When Deputy Michael Noonan asked him whether a Cabinet meeting should be convened to make this a priority legislative matter, the Taoiseach indicated that would not be necessary because it would be the priority.  It now appears we will not even have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks on Tuesday night I referred to the importance of setting down key principles in relation to sports policy.  I cited the New Zealand Hillary Commission for Sports Fitness and suggested that the goals mentioned in that strategy should underpin the sports strategy of the new Irish Sports Council.  They include the need to increase participation in fitness and leisure, the need to enhance performance in sport fitness and leisure and the need to improve the organisational infrastructure and programme delivery systems for sports fitness and leisure.  Ultimately what is required is an integrated approach operating at a number of different levels and I will emphasise that point in the course of my contribution.</P>
      <P>Cospóir published an important report in 1994, The Economic Impact of Sports in Ireland, which states that the 20th century has been characterised by dramatic improvements in living standards and by widespread social and technological change.  It further states that shorter working hours, longer holiday periods, changes in attitudes and knowledge of health, together with the greater availability of income for spending on discretionary activities, have led to rapid growth in the range and volume of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> In a community context, sporting activities have relevance not only as a source of recreation and a contribution to health but they generate such diverse effects as influencing crime rates or as forms of cultural expression.  That report was published in 1994 and much of our thinking has evolved from that time.  It was carried through into John Treacy's document Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland which stated that people take part in sport for many reasons including competition, fun, social contacts, health and fitness.</P>
    <P>The contribution made by sport to the quality of life of people and to the economy has increased significantly in recent years.  The Bill will greatly expand the role of the Irish Sports Council and it will give it statutory recognition for the first time.  I welcome that its role is to be broadened beyond that of advising and that it will assume responsibility for certain executive functions currently fulfilled by the Minister.  It is also welcome that the sports council will promote wider participation in sport by developing strategies and putting in place codes of conduct and practice which emphasise fair play.</P>
    <P>The passing of the Bill will mark a milestone for sport in Ireland and it will underline the high priority placed on sport and recreation by the Government and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid.  As well as bringing sport to the Cabinet table for the first time, the Government has increased funding for the development of sport to £26 million this year from £17 million last year.  We have come a long way since Cospóir was first established in the early 1970s when Deputy O'Kennedy was Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of Education. The budget allocation for Cospóir and sport in general at that stage was the princely sum, by today's standards, of £100,000.</P>
    <P>A key objective of any sports policy must be to involve young people at all levels and to encourage them to develop a lifelong interest in playing and enjoying sport.  The future development of sport for young people should move away from the current fragmented approach and it should be planned in the context of the home, the school or the community.  Fragmentation is one of the hallmarks of sports policy delivery here and it must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>In the education sector, physical education programmes at both first and second level must be significantly enhanced.  At primary level there are no officially designated physical education teachers.  All primary teachers &mdash; I include myself in this because I spent 30 years in the teaching profession &mdash; are expected to teach this complex subject having acquired only the most basic training in teacher training college.  Ongoing in-service training is largely absent apart from the voluntary training acquired on summer courses.  In many classes physical education is hardly taught at all and 30 minutes spent kicking a ball around a hall often passes for physical education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Traditionally there is one &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; day in schools per year.  This hardly compensates for the system's shortcomings during the remainder of the year.  I recall circulars arriving from the Department of Education and Science advising teachers that &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; day would take place invariably on the Thursday before the June Bank Holiday weekend.  That was a creative way of organising a fun day for schoolchildren before they embarked on their holiday weekend.  There was also a fear among teachers that a schools inspector would arrive to evaluate what one was trying to do in terms of providing physical education. A mindset exists in the Department and among teachers which must be changed.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration must be given to the appointment of physical education teachers in primary schools with priority being given to schools situated in disadvantaged urban areas.  It might even be possible as an initial step to appoint physical education teachers for particular areas.  Their services could be shared among the primary schools in those areas.  In devising programmes of sport and physical education activities at primary level, emphasis should be placed on participation and fun rather than competition. In that context, I support the work done by the Irish mini-sport movement over the years.  I compliment the Minister for Education and Science on the pilot project currently ongoing in a number of schools which gives priority to physical education.</P>
    <P>The park tennis league operates during the summer in Dublin under the aegis of Dublin Corporation and is normally sponsored privately. This league is run on a shoestring budget but it does a great deal to promote the sport of tennis. Similarly, the municipal rowing centre at Island-bridge &mdash; a co-operative venture between Dublin Corporation and the City of Dublin VEC &mdash; does a great deal to attract people who might not otherwise be interested in competitive sport to a pastime they might find challenging and interesting.</P>
    <P>To return to education, the syllabus at second level is badly in need of revision.  There are approximately 800 physical education teachers employed in post primary schools.  In the region of 50 per cent of these schools have a full-time PE teacher.  However, in many cases these teachers perform other functions and they are unable to devote their time exclusively to physical education or sports activities.  In some schools physical education teachers often serve as career guidance teachers and they also organise other activities.  That approach does no good in terms of providing children with physical education or career guidance.</P>
    <P>The lack of facilities for sporting activities in schools remains a problem.  Many schools were built when the level of available funds was quite low and they include what are called &ldquo;general purpose&rdquo; rooms which are too big to serve as classrooms and too small to serve as sports areas. It is time to embark on a programme of constructing <Col N="257" /> sports halls large enough to at least accommodate a decent basketball court.  I do not suggest that such halls should be built in every area and I will deal later with how there should be shared ownership of these facilities.  Where a local community facility exists which could be adapted for use by a school, it should be possible for a partnership to be developed so that the school and the local community can benefit from the allocation of scarce resources.  For example, Ashbourne Community School shares the local community centre very effectively.  The benefits of this approach are great because the centre has a cost-effective tenant between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and the community can then avail of an upgraded centre for the remainder of the afternoon and evening.</P>
    <P>Sharing facilities means that it would be possible to have one well equipped centre where high quality programmes could be delivered.  A good model for this exists at Coláiste Íde in Finglas, where a sports complex built as a joint venture by the City of Dublin VEC and Dublin Corporation in the early 1980s services the needs of more than 800 post-leaving certificate students up to 4 p.m. each Monday to Friday and where a wide range of programmes is delivered to the local community up to 11 p.m. on weeknights and all day on Saturday and Sunday.  Approximately 1,200 members of the community use the centre during the hours it is available to them.  I understand the centre operates quite well and the local community has access to a state of the art facility staffed by fully qualified personnel.  The provision of such personnel is at least as important as building a facility in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is vital that those who staff sports centres such as that situated at Coláiste Íde hold qualifications from the NCVA or from Thomond College. The Coláiste Íde sports complex was opened in 1985 with one paid member of staff.  That situation still obtains with other members of staff being appointed from community employment schemes, usually for a term of one year.  This issue must be addressed.  Another lesson which can be learned from the Coláiste Íde model relates to the youth services for the Finglas area which are also based in the complex.  This provides a way to attract to a sports complex young people who might not otherwise be interested in going there. Some of the best youth work is done by sports clubs which, at this stage, are the only clubs which are run by volunteers because the majority of other organisations are being taken over by &ldquo;paid professionals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Institutions such as Coláiste Íde run outreach programmes.  For example, Coláiste Íde services programmes in Coolock and the inner city &mdash; where swimming classes are co-ordinated and facilitated &mdash; and it runs outdoor pursuits programmes in Blessington.  Therefore, a centre of activity or excellence is responsible for driving the entire complex.</P>
    <P>Discussing the lack of facilities raises the perennially thorny issue of the numerous school <Col N="258" /> facilities which lie unused each weekend and during holiday periods.  While I accept there are insurance difficulties involved, these are surely not insurmountable.  Several attempts have been made by successive Ministers to try to develop an insurance policy which would allow relatively easy access to school facilities by community and sports groups.  I am not sure if a successful one has been devised.  All things being equal, these facilities would be better respected if they were more readily available to sports and leisure groups.  Recently there has been a huge increase in recreational sport which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  Undoubtedly, part of this increase is due to the increased amount of leisure time available.  Cospóir can also take a bow in this regard because of its promotion of the sport-for-all strategy delivered to a large extent through the sports advisory councils of the vocational education committees.  Those sports advisory councils have done an excellent co-ordinating job in promoting pursuits such as mountain walking and introductory swimming.  In Dublin many important initiatives have derived from the activities of the sports advisory council.</P>
    <P>Through the promotion of the sport-for-all strategy, many people have come to know and love the Wicklow Way, the Kerry Way and the joys of basic orienteering or swimming.  Many older people have become involved in indoor bowling clubs and as a result greatly enhanced the quality of their lives.  I have often watched up to 100 keen bowlers enjoy themselves on dark winter evenings in the warm and comfortable surroundings of the Tolka aerobics club in my constituency. I have no doubt this type of activity has kept many an older person away from the doctor's surgery and out of a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>Recreational sport is a people's movement. Without well co-ordinated delivery, structures and quality leadership, regular mass participation in sport is unlikely to become a reality.  It is important, therefore, that a recreational sports strategy, which might be developed by the new sports council, sets out as far as possible to encourage those who are not taking part in any form of sport to do so.  We should ensure every person, irrespective of age, gender or ability has access to a wide range of sports and not just through the zapper on television and that the necessary infrastructure is put in place for the long-term involvement of people in sport.  With an ageing population this is all the more important.</P>
    <P>To ensure this happens it is important the membership of the council strikes a clear balance between those who come from a recreational sports background and those whose interests lie in the area of competitive or elite sports.  Perhaps the Minister would include a clause which would reflect those interests in section 12 which refers to the membership and term of office of the council. I am concerned the sports policy could be driven by the professionals and those involved in elite sports.  A provision should be included to <Col N="259" /> ensure recreational sport is included in the council's strategy.  The ILAM and Thomond College have done an enormous amount of work in researching the whole area of participation in sport and developing an interest in recreational sports.  Their views would be interesting.</P>
    <P>I make no secret of the fact that I favour recreational sport over competitive or elite sports.  I have great regard for those who, on a shoestring budget, run football teams and athletic clubs literally out of car boots, wash the kit at home, sell spot-the-ball cards or organise race nights to keep the operation afloat.  They rarely have time to do anything else and certainly cannot compete with the media driven competitive athletes.  I cannot understand why sports such as chess and bridge get little support at official level.  There is a constant Jesuitical debate about whether chess is a sport.  Many young people find it an engaging sporting pursuit, admittedly the concentration is on mental activity.  Similarly I know hundreds of older people who derive enormous stimulus from bridge and I ask the sports council to revisit that area.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Bill which seeks to put the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis.  I hope it will be given the necessary funding.  Sport is one of the best outlets for young people but for many years it did not get support.  I compliment the former Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who did an excellent job in the previous Government for small sporting organisations.  He assisted many small clubs in my constituency which have done a wonderful job over the years.  As the previous speaker said, many people involved in sport have assisted young people without any financial reward.  Deputy Allen was an excellent Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have a major influence on young people such as professional footballers, whether involved in soccer or rugby, and Gaelic players who, although not professionals, but to whom people look up, have a huge responsibility.  Given the extent of our social problems, if ever we needed sport to assist young people, it is now.  For that reason I hope the sports council will work and that it gets the backing and the support, financial <Col N="260" /> and otherwise, from the State to get more people involved in sport.</P>
    <P>There are not enough outlets for young people. I came from a housing estate where 30, 40 or 50 young people played football every evening. Young people were fighting to get on the team. One does not see young people playing football or camogie in housing estates anymore.  They are indoors watching &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; and so on.  They should be told what they are watching is not real.  It is time parents put an end to it.  Before going to school they have to watch a soap opera; at lunchtime, 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. they watch soap operas.  It is no wonder their minds are poisoned and that they do not realise there is something else for them other than soaps and television.  I say to the Minister, teachers and schools, it is time sport was made compulsory on the school agenda.  Young people should have to take part in sport for an hour or two each week.  When I was young there was no television and young people had nothing to do except play football.  They learned how to mix and to participate in sport, but those days are gone.</P>
    <P>Why is it that when a team from soccer clubs, Gaelic clubs or other sporting organisation wins a cup or the final, those in charge take them to the pub to fill the cup?  I am totally opposed to that.  It has a bad influence on young people.  Why are they not taken to a fish and chip shop or to a restaurant and provided with a small meal rather than to a pub where the cup is filled.  That is poor example.</P>
    <P>Some people cannot take part in sport unless they are taking drugs.  I hope this matter will be dealt with.  I realise the Minister said a testing programme would be put in place.  There is no place in Ireland or in sport for those who enhance their performance by taking drugs to make them better runners, footballers or rugby players.  That is a poor example for young people.  Irish people are sportsmen and sportswomen.  We love people who put on the green jersey whether for soccer, Gaelic, rugby, tennis or golf.  Once they represent the country and take part in world championships we are proud of them and support them.  When the Irish soccer team took part in the World Cup, the whole nation was behind them.  If a county team, whether in Donegal, Cavan or Mayo, is doing well, it has the support of every person in the county.  We all like to see our local club, our county team and our national team doing well at local, national or international level.  That is why sport has a big influence on young people.  I am delighted a sports council will be set up on a statutory basis.  It will give people involved in sport the necessary powers and funds to promote all types of sport.  It is important to get young people involved in sport, even if it is only playing marbles.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to drugs in sport and people in authority who have abused the trust of young people.  In recent years people involved in sporting organisations abused girls and boys.  There is <Col N="261" /> no place in Irish society or sport for those people and I compliment the Minister on addressing this problem in swimming.</P>
    <P>I compliment the many thousands of people throughout this country, to whom Deputy Carey referred, who voluntarily give of their time to help young people participate in sport.  I am mindful of people like Martin Keane and Ollie Gannon in my town who give a full-time commitment to sport.  Most of those people work full-time, but they spend a good deal of the free time on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday organising under sevens, under eights and under tens indoor and outdoor football to keep young people on the straight and narrow.  I compliment all those people throughout the State and thank them for the wonderful work they do for our society.  They should be complimented, supported and honoured in their communities.  There are many people trying to sell young people drugs and drink and bring them down a different road. Sport is one of the best roads by which we can bring people back on track.  I hope the proposed sports council will be successful in doing that.</P>
    <P>The disbursement of lottery funding is suspended pending a review of the position.  While lottery funding allocations of £20 million and £150 million are welcome and good PR, allocations of £1,000, £3,000, £4,000 and £5,000 to small clubs, such as those in Erris, Ballinrobe, Westport and Castlebar are very beneficial.  Ballyglass, a small rural club, was allocated lottery funding on two occasions under the previous Government.  It used it wisely and built beautiful facilities which the former President opened.  It has a football pitch and new dressing rooms and one would be proud to bring any club from around the world to it.  A small allocation of money to that local club facilitated wonderful work.  Allocations of £20 million and £150 million are good, but they do not have the same effect as allocations of small amounts of £3,000 or £4,000 to local clubs.  Such small allocations reward the voluntary effort of people in the community who have worked hard in the sporting organisations to help and assist young people who are very pleased to have their own facilities.</P>
    <P>I am sure my colleagues from Cavan, Deputies Boylan and Smith, will compliment Catherina McKiernan on her recent achievement.  We were proud of her last Sunday and have been proud of her over the years.  She has set a fine example and is a fine athlete.  We wish her well in the future.  I am sure Deputy Boylan will have more to say about that.  As an Irishman, her performance last Sunday and on national television brought tears to my eyes.  She is a credit to the country and to Cavan.  I was delighted she said recently that she was outraged about people in sport who take drugs and that there is no place in sport for those people.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an appeal to those who make it in sport, whether in golf, rugby, Gaelic or soccer, but particularly the soccer heroes.  Over the years we have listened to them dictate to us what we <Col N="262" /> are not doing right in this country.  However, when many of those people did well in England and made a good deal of money they did not come back to do anything for this country.  They have an obligation to our young people and they should not be paid for coming over here to preach the right message to young people.  They have a commitment to this country.  They have got something out of sport and should give back something to it.  They should not always look for £10,000 or £15,000 for a public appearance to do something for young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time with me.  I thank him for his kind remarks about Catherina McKiernan, a lady from my county, of whom we are justly proud.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is probably one of the most important to come before the House in recent months.  It provides for the establishment of a sports council on a statutory basis, an agency that will deal with all aspects of sport.  The Minister is fortunate in holding the portfolio of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  Sport and recreation can be grouped together because they are one and the same. Through sport we can promote what is best about our country through our athletes who make it to international arenas.  They bring much credit to our country and we must ensure they are properly looked after.</P>
      <P>I note the former Minister, Deputy Allen, is sitting on the Front Bench where he rightly belongs.  He did excellent work as Minister and I take this opportunity to thank him for his generous grant of £100,000 &mdash; a substantial sum three years ago &mdash; to build a swimming pool in the town of Bailieboro in my county.  That allocation has not gone unnoticed; it is very much appreciated and has been of much benefit.</P>
      <P>I note the Department is seeking tenders for a proposed 50 metre swimming pool.  I presume it will be located in this fair city of Dublin.  I presume almost all major developments will be located here but similar developments should be located throughout the country.  We have excellent motorways and roadways to all areas.  If we are to develop sport in all its aspects and give all our young people an opportunity, the facilities we put in place should be spread across the country, to Donegal, Cavan, Dublin, Kerry, Cork, Limerick and so on.  They should not be located in Dublin simply because we believe that they must be based there.  Dublin is congested and it is difficult to get to and from it.  It is not that I do not want to see sports development in Dublin.  A grant of £20 million has been allocated to Croke Park. The provision of a 50 metre swimming pool is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be considering the establishment of a national stadium as a millennium project to which we could attract all international events.  Some people laugh at Deputy Gay Mitchell's proposal that we should make a bid to hold the Olympic Games, but that is not foolish thinking. <Col N="263" /> The island of Ireland, North and South, should join together to make that bid.  All the games could be facilitiated in facilities in Belfast, Derry, Dublin, Donegal and if we did not have the facilities to host some of the games, it would not be difficult to arrange for them to be held across the water in Great Britain.  The holding of the games on this side of the world would be advantageous and that proposal should be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the provision of sports facilities for young people to ensure that they get off on the right track.  I listened with interest to the excellent contributions of the previous Fianna Fáil speaker and Deputy Ring.  Deputies are thinking the right way in terms of getting people off to a good start in life.  That is vitally important. There is no better way of doing that than through sport.  Participation in sport helps young people develop their personalities, it toughens them up and, most importantly, helps them make friends for life.  The GAA has done a marvellous job and there is great comaraderie in clubs, on the playing fields and in the dressing rooms.</P>
    <P>Butlersbridge is a small place on the map, but the Minister when travelling to Donegal would pass through it.  Our local team won the national senior league final last weekend.  There were great celebrations.  We filled the cup but not with lemonade.  That success brought people together and they took pride in what was a small event at national level, but very important locally.  Local club events bring people together throughout the country and such success inspires young people. Dermot McCabe, who came to national prominence and prior to that was centre field on the Cavan county team and who made such an impact in the games with Australia, made a very nice gesture when he presented medals to under 16 year olds.  Young people look up to people like him who are prepared to give their time.</P>
    <P>Catherina McKiernan has created a marvellous clean image, not only for my county but for the country.  The good Lord has bestowed gifts on her which she has nurtured and developed without tampering with any additives.  This must be recognised, given the number of questions that have been raised about the achievements of international athletes.  There can be no question about the achievements of Catherina McKiernan. People like her who are involved in sporting activities, such as athletics boxing, golf, table tennis &mdash; according to the newspapers a lad in Dublin has made a big name for himself in this sport &mdash; should be asked to portray the country as a tourism destination with a clean image.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the way in which BLE is treating Catherina McKiernan.  The Minister should ask the board to stop interfering with her programme of work and her ambition to bring honour and glory to this country at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.  It is wrong of the board to impose any embargo on her programme of work and training.  How many members of the <Col N="264" /> board have run a marathon and know what they are talking about?  It is annoying and disappointing that it should treat a person in this way.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done about spreading funding provided by the national lottery.  I commend what Deputy Allen did for a swimming pool in Bailieboro.  Money should be made available for small swimming pools and recreation areas across the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Carey referred to facilities attached to schools.  Unfortunately when schools were developed and built money and resources were scarce.  Green areas were not incorporated in the plans with the result that during playtime young people have very few facilities.  Those teachers interested in teaching them various sporting skills do not have the facilities at their disposal.  While green areas are difficult to provide in some built up areas it is very important that some facilities be provided.  A substantial recreation or sports hall is necessary and if these are not part of a school complex they should be within easy reach of children during school hours.</P>
    <P>I recognise the work of teachers and others involved in sport after school hours.  It is fully appreciated.  However, sport should be part of the curriculum because it develops a good healthy mindset.  In today's world parents are working to provide for the home which means that time schedules are difficult to accommodate.  Perhaps there should be an extra hour one day a week when the school bus would not collect children until, say, 4 o'clock.  This could then be devoted to sport.  It would also mean that parents would not have to worry about transport as all of the children would be provided for.  When a small number of children become interested others will follow.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He has our full support. He is promoting a very important development and I hope it is successful and will bring about the results we all desire.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  The legislation acts on a key recommendation of the landmark report entitled Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, 1997 &mdash; 2006 and Beyond published by the national sports strategy group.  Furthermore, the legislation fulfils the commitment by Fianna Fáil prior to the last general election to create a sports council on a statutory basis.  The role of the sports council, which has acted on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis for more than 20 years and has acted in an advisory capacity to different Ministers, will be greatly expanded.  Its wider remit is to be welcomed.  It will enable appropriate research to be undertaken and the development of strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport.  No <Col N="265" /> doubt these will enhance the further development of sport and recreation in this country.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government for its commitment to the vital areas of sport and recreation, areas that have been neglected for far too long. No action reflects this commitment better than the decision to establish a separate Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation so that the interests of Ireland's sportspeople, whether at professional or amateur level, are represented at the Cabinet for the first time in the history of the State.  Fortunately those interests are represented with great ability and foresight by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We all know the importance of sport in terms of promoting fitness and wellbeing.  It is essential for the creation of a healthy and vibrant society. It also promotes a positive image of the country to the world as our professional athletes are our ambassadors at international level.  We all feel a sense of pride when we see our flag raised and our anthem played at an international event.  I take this opportunity to again congratulate Catherina McKiernan from my county on her memorable victory in Amsterdam last Sunday and on her recent victories in Berlin and London. We all wish her continued success in the future.</P>
      <P>The Government's interest in sport and recreation is enshrined in the programme for Government.  The establishment of a fully functional and efficient national sports council will bring together all sporting interests and activities. It can act as a dynamo for the further development of sport.  The council will have an effective and solid statutory foundation.</P>
      <P>Sport is a necessary part of the growth of the individual, in its own way as important as formal education.  For that reason the Government is right to introduce a greater role for sport and training in the school curriculum.  Sport boosts self confidence and self reliance, instilling a sense of personal achievement and pride at what has been gained by effort and endurance.  Young people achieve a sense of how good it feels to be fit and in good health.  They not only earn respect for the hard knocks that sport often throws at them, whether they be the inevitable failures and defeats or the occasional injury, but they also learn the importance of team spirit and how co-operation and the pooling of talent brings the best results.</P>
      <P>Sport is also a very effective weapon in the fight against drug abuse as it offers a clear and attractive alternative to the misery and suffering of dependants on artificial stimulants.  Sport and recreation policy must embrace all in the community. It is also easy to forget that sport and fitness must be accessible to the disabled.  For that reason I commend the Minister on his commitment to provide £5 million towards support for the hosting of the Special Olympics in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is already making a positive difference.  Its funding allocation has been increased to £26 million, a clear demonstration of the commitment by the Fianna Fáil Party and the <Col N="266" /> Government to augment the resources available for sports and recreation.  A scheme has been established to support high performance athletes whose requirements for training must be catered for if they are to perform at their best.  All must be done to cultivate the cream of our sporting talent and such a scheme will enable those who have been blessed with extraordinary gifts to reveal them to the world.</P>
    <P>Funding has been allocated to the various governing bodies for sport to enable them pursue their interests.  Furthermore, earlier this year the Minister allocated grants to separate projects around the country to enable the provision of recreational facilities.  It is quite obvious to all of us in public life that more funding is needed.  Each weekend we receive deputations from sports and youth organisations that are developing much needed facilities on a shoestring.  I hope that when the Minister, Deputy McDaid, brings in a new scheme for recreational facilities, the necessary additional funding will be provided to ensure that those groups doing outstanding work are given the necessary financial boost to assist them with the development of facilities which are very costly.</P>
    <P>We are all grateful for the sacrifices of people such as Catherina McKiernan, Packie Bonner, Seán Kelly, Stephen Roche, golfers and so many others who bring immense honour to our country. For most of us it is hard to comprehend or visualise the commitment which lies behind these performances &mdash; the hours spent in training, sometimes on dark, cold evenings after a day's work, with little or no material incentive, except the reward of overcoming yet another challenge or chalking up another personal best.</P>
    <P>The world of sport has become much more professional in recent years.  This is, in part, a reflection of the greater cost of technology in training. However, let us not forget the invaluable contribution made by voluntary sporting organisations. One of the oldest is the Gaelic Athletic Association, but there are numerous others whose members have been stimulated by selfless dedication to their respective sports.  Such dedication can sometimes last a lifetime, beginning at school and continuing into adulthood.  For those people there is no astronomical pay cheque after each event and no high flying lifestyle.  When injury strikes it can have serious consequences for one's income earning capacity and the only hope is an understanding employer.  Even when such sports people come to the end of their competitive careers, many continue their sporting associations through training and nurturing the next generation in a local club.  All this is done voluntarily, the only tangible gains being a few medals won along the way, to be cherished and handed on to children and grandchildren.  The world of sport must be inspired by these people and their unpaid efforts.</P>
    <P>Each year hundreds of thousands of people in this country and abroad enjoy Gaelic games.  The athleticism and extraordinary commitment shown <Col N="267" /> by Gaelic players is now an integral part of society.  Those of us who derive enjoyment from such games throughout the year owe a great deal of gratitude to those players, their mentors and officials.  The level of fitness maintained by players at inter-county level is remarkable and easily comparable to that of professional players.  With the growth in the economy it is appropriate that additional resources should be allocated to sports and recreation.  Communities that suffer serious disadvantage should be given particular attention.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have met deputations from the north-east Contract Bridge Association who are anxious to have their game recognised as an official sport.  They have put forward a well argued case in view of the large numbers participating in that recreation.  I appeal to the Minister to give their request for official recognition further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in bringing forward this long awaited Bill. This legislative structure will properly recognise the importance of sport in contemporary society. Many thousands of people derive great pleasure and benefit from their involvement in sport of all kinds.  The sports council, which the Bill proposes to establish, is as much about the hundreds of thousands who participate in sport at all levels as it is about recognising our outstanding individual sportspeople.</P>
      <P>It is vital that we support athletes who represent our country at the highest international level, but it is equally important to nurture an interest in and love of sport among those participating at local level.  The late Noel Carroll brought great honour to the country by competing and winning on the international stage.  Right up to his sad death, he worked hard to open up sport, to encourage participation and give the greatest number of people an opportunity to become involved.  One of his greatest achievements was to have given over the capital to the people for the marathon.  I extend sympathy to Mr. Carroll's widow and family, in particular to his sister, Mrs. Helena Keegan of Rosenallis, who is a near neighbour of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the voluntary sports sector, the new sports council should ensure that individuals and sports administrators, such as the late Noel Carroll, who give their time to their communities for the promotion of sport, are not forgotten when it comes to allocating resources.  Large amateur groups, sporting and athletic clubs, commit themselves to the development of sport despite often inadequate facilities.  Perhaps the sports council will provide resources where work is being done and where there is most need.  The council will not need to be reminded that while only 30 people may line out on All-Ireland final day, those who do so have come through school sports, under-age local clubs and teams, and have played alongside hundreds who may never represent their county or country.  My home county <Col N="268" /> of Laois took great pride in its minor and senior football and hurling teams this year, and will do so again next year.  I am sure the players and trainers will back my call that not only the senior levels of sport should receive support.</P>
    <P>Despite their intrusiveness, the Minister is to be lauded for the measures he is introducing to combat the ravages of drugs in some of our most troubled areas.  Sport has been recognised as a positive and healthy social activity.  The rewards that sport can offer an individual or society are immeasurable.  We should ensure that sport retains this positive identification for young people and their parents alike.  Recent drug scandals in sport have done much to damage the image of sport as a healthy and positive contribution to our lives.  It is essential to adopt adequate measures, such as those proposed in the Bill, to show that so-called performance enhancing drugs have no place whatsoever in our sporting culture.  We can no longer be accused of standing idly by and allowing those activities to continue.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, random dope testing has been the norm for a number of years.  A minor cycling event in a rural area is as likely to be visited by independent dope testers as a major event in a city or town, and young athletes know that. Perhaps there could be cross-Border co-operation in this area.  Those who are found to have taken drugs in sport should be dealt with severely. Mandatory bans and fines should be rigorously introduced to remove drugs from sport.  A new understanding of excellence should be extended to embrace those who participate fairly and competitively according to their own ability.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the huge contribution the voluntary sector makes to local communities. Laois County Council, of which I am a member, recently appointed a sports and recreation officer, Ms Ann-Marie Maher.  This appointment is a source of pride to me as we have recognised that sport has a huge contribution to make to everyone in the county.  The County Laois sports and recreation officer has a database and advice to offer people of any age with any kind of physical ability.  The message is simple &mdash; try to get involved.</P>
    <P>I hope the new sports council will be a resource for local initiatives such as those promoted by the Laois sports and recreation officer.  The sports council can make a significant contribution to those working at grassroots level.  There are huge possibilities for gifted individual athletes who represent their country.  I hope the sports council will look at new ways to encourage private sponsorship for sports people, perhaps recommending tax incentives whereby contributions for emerging athletes would be tax deductible, thus freeing up revenue to support broader activities.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that the sports council will officer leadership and will enforce a code of conduct to ensure that our young people are not at risk.  The monstrous behaviour of those who presided over swimming for years must never be <Col N="269" /> allowed to recur.  The sports council should work at providing a safe environment for our young people to participate in.</P>
    <P>The sports council heralds the arrival of a new era in sport, where fair play, access for everyone, participation, pride, support and enjoyment will form the basis of sporting activity.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on living up to his commitment to bring this important legislation before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill establishing an Irish sports council on a statutory basis.  I compliment the Minister on introducing it.  I also compliment my colleague, Deputy Bernard Allen, who, as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, put the concept forward.  It is the right thing to do.  I am glad the current Minister has seen the light and has agreed in principle with the setting up of the sports council.</P>
      <P>Because I am sharing time I do not have time to go into detail, but there are a number of points I will address.  Sport has played a major role and has been very beneficial in the lives of the majority of people here for many years.  I was always of the view that drug use in sport, especially among our elite sports people, was non-existent, but my naiveté has been blown out of the water on a couple of occasions following press statements about form-enhancing drugs being taken by some of our sports stars.  I found that deeply disturbing and disappointing.  It does not present a good image of sports development, and it is certainly not a good image to present to young people, particularly young people with ability who, because of the professionalism of athletics, rugby, soccer and so on, see an opportunity to take up sport as a career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to a point I have laboured for some time, although it is slightly removed from the Minister's role in the area of sport and recreation.  That is the question of the introduction of a national identity card scheme here.  The biggest difficulty facing small parochial rugby, soccer and GAA clubs in the future is the problem of young people drinking under age.  This could cause difficulties for sports development in the long-term.  It is not the Minister's area of responsibility, but he should be supportive in Cabinet of the idea of introducing a national identity card scheme.  It would be beneficial if young people could be prevented from drinking alcohol until they reach 18 years of age.  Many young people are drinking at 14 or 15 years of age.  Then when they come to the age of 18 or 19 years they get no kick out of alcohol and turn to &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs as a recreational habit and perhaps to enhance their sporting prowess.  In the interest <Col N="270" /> of developing anti-drug sentiment, a national identity card scheme should be put in place.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, it is a good idea that sports should be included in the leaving and junior certificate programmes.  The financial cost to the State of doing this would be large, as the sports facilities available in primary schools, and in many second level schools, are not of a high standard.  Only some second level schools have indoor facilities, most sports activity taking place outdoors, and the climatic conditions here are not conducive to outdoor sports activity during the winter months, not to mention the summer.  If we are serious about including sports and recreation as a subject in the leaving and junior certificate curricula, the Department will have to take into account the major capital cost implications for primary and second level schools.  It would be more important to provide primary schools with proper sporting facilities.  The games rooms in many primary schools are totally inadequate, so there will be a huge capital cost if we are to include sport and recreation in school curricula.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the role of the voluntary sector in encouraging participation in sports by young people.  The voluntary sector has done tremendous work for no return in the GAA, in soccer, rugby and many other sports disciplines.  It is very important that that voluntary ethos is continued, because if the State were to become involved in providing training and facilities parochially, it would be very difficult to manage.  I hope, and have no doubt, that the Irish Sports Council will recognise the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the development of sports stadia. It is extremely important that we should develop proper sporting facilities.  I compliment the GAA on their work in Croke Park.  They were very brave and have shown that commercially viable facilities will always attract individuals and business.  However, we are a small country and we should look at the example of countries like Italy where major clubs like Inter Milan and AC Milan share a stadium.  In Ireland, clubs try to have their own and to hold on to their own.  The Taoiseach's proposal to build a national stadium was welcome.  It should be seriously considered, but it is difficult to reconcile giving £20 million to the GAA for the development of Croke Park, with which I had no difficulty, and the provision of a national stadium some place else.  The feasibility of putting a national stadium in place should be examined because we do have a very good international soccer team.  The rugby team is a bit hit and miss, but we have many very fine athletes and no place to show them or to bring international competition.  The idea of providing a national sports stadium is a good one. The capital cost is a prohibitive factor.  To go back to that old chestnut, the 50 metre swimming pool, it is crazy that we are probably the only country in the EU without such a pool.  There is much work to be done.  I have no doubt the Minister is aware of the difficulties and is willing to try to alleviate the problems.  I wish him luck over the <Col N="271" /> next few years.  I hope the Irish Sports Council, when it is set up, will be of benefit to sport in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's Bill providing for the establishment of a statutory agency to deal with the promotion and development of sport.  As a nation we are very proud of our sporting heroes.  Per head of population we have been fairly successful on the world stage. We all recall the euphoria about Barry McGuigan's victory over Pedroza, of Packie Bonner's save and Stephen Roche's win in Paris.  We also remember the pain of Sonia O'Sullivan's Olympic defeats and the sadness at the recent passing of Noel Carroll.  Sporting heroes occupy a high plateau in this country and most young children dream of playing in Croke Park, Lansdowne Road or Wembley in the hope of emulating their idols.  There is no better method of making schoolgoing children eat their morning porridge than by extolling the virtues which may accrue to them if they fill their stomachs.  In this respect, it is difficult not to notice the increasing popularity of female team sports.  Most people who watched the recent womens' football finals were delighted with the standard and commitment shown, even if the result did not go the way the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would have liked.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, we view involvement in sport, from the highest competitive level to the stroll in the park, as good.  We associate a certain honour with it and, as a result, there has never been a difficulty in obtaining and keeping the services of voluntary workers.  The Minister correctly pointed out that they have been the backbone of sport for generations. Sport makes a huge contribution to the social well being of the country and is an important and influential commodity.</P>
      <P>With the development of society, sport has become big business on the world stage.  This has spilled over to this country and several sporting organisations have, or are undergoing, major change.  With the advent of television rights and product endorsement, the emphasis has shifted to a win syndrome and this has led to certain difficulties. The Minister mentioned that it poses certain challenges.  As we strive to protect our environment, we must also protect our sport and those involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Sports Council was set up in 1996 to advise the Minister on all aspects of sport and to co-ordinate resources.  It has done an excellent job.  The report on sport in Ireland for the years 1997-2006 and beyond, commissioned by Deputy Allen when he was Minister, recommended the council be established on a statutory basis to provide the co-ordination and leadership required to achieve the goals set out in the strategy and to bring sport into the next century.  The Minister is now doing this.  The main goal of the council is to build an integrated and co-ordinated sports system for Ireland where sound technical and professional <Col N="272" /> expertise is combined with the energy and commitment of volunteers.  Much of this work has already begun and amazing strides have been made in a few short years.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation recently visited the National Coaching and Training Centre at the University of Limerick where the facilities and expertise are equal to anywhere else in the world.  The centre was formally opened in 1992 by the then Minister, Deputy Aylward, and has obtained many achievements to date, such as the establishment and implementation of the national coaching development programme, direct sports science and medical support for more than 30 national squads and many world champions and medal-lists, and the conduct of research into rowing, GAA, player-athlete needs and sports policy.</P>
    <P>During the last year the committee invited several organisations, including the GAA, the FAI and the swimming and diving associations to attend its meetings, and they all outlined the various contributions they make.  The emphasis was on the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport.  This is of particular importance given its potential to promote fair play, social skills and a positive approach to competition. There have been many recent highly publicised cases of child abuse in sport and some parents have been reluctant to involve their children in some group sports.  By and large, the hierarchy in all sporting organisations realise the importance of implementing the code.  However, in some cases it may not be filtering down and, over the passage of time, its implementation may wane.</P>
    <P>The most important function of the new statutory sports council will be to ensure this code is strictly implemented and adhered to, thus reassuring those parents who have become uncertain. Deputy Shatter's Bill on the reporting of child abuse will be of great assistance in this area. One of sport's governing bodies contacted me recently to say the ethics in sport booklet was not available in the Government Publications Office and was told the office was not sure when it would be available again.  Perhaps the Minister might investigate that because it should be available at all times for various organisations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's interest in pursuing a joint venture route with interested commercial and sporting organisations in the provision of national and regional sports facilities.  Many of our fine sporting facilities lie idle for long periods and could be put to multiple uses with the availability of funding which could be used for upkeep and much needed redevelopment.  I hope that, in its role of co-ordination, the sports council would seek to identify certain stadia which can be developed so that some time in the future we may be able to host some of the largest sporting events currently denied to us.  Deputy Gay Mitchell's proposal to host the Olympics in Dublin may not seem so unrealistic after all.  Some of the facilities at various sporting locations around the country leave a lot to be desired, particularly women's <Col N="273" /> facilities and access for the disabled.  Very often our love of sport inhibits us from highlighting and addressing these shortcomings.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that last year more than 900,000 tourists took part in sports activities during their stay in Ireland.  It is important to realise that many of these would have partaken in what are in the main minority sports in this country.  When these groups are seeking funding, they may not have a large local support base for their cause.  The benefits such organisations and groups bring to the economy should be borne in mind when funds are distributed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the national sports anti-doping programme which the Minister launched in June this year, it is imperative that our children's idols do not become fallen idols.  Recent history has shown there is tremendous pressure on individual and team athletes to achieve results.  While one can never condone the taking of banned substances, it is difficult to comprehend the pressure certain people may be under to perform.  In this case prevention will definitely be the best cure.  I sincerely hope the various governing bodies of sport address any problems they have in this area and that the operational aspects of the implementation programme are dealt with quickly so a message is sent to all participants in sport that, if they indulge in illegal or banned substances, they do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>I compliment John Treacy on the excellent job he has done with the Sports Council to date.  I hope it can further develop and strengthen our sporting image to ensure it stays clean and emphasises that, despite all surrounding influences and natural instincts which may say otherwise, the important thing is not whether one won or lost but how one played the game.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to measure the benefits of funding of sport.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday there would be no cash bonanza in the budget.  Too much money can never be spent on sport and great benefits can accrue down the line to a community.  I spoke recently with a person in Wicklow town about an area there some might regard as tough.  He said there was never any difficulty with crime mainly because all are involved in sports.</P>
    <P>Regarding funding for community games, while I realise the Department gives a grant to the governing body, local groups receive funding from local authorities.  Very often this may be only £100 or £200.  Perhaps the Minister could examine that, although I realise a bottomless pit of funding is not available.  It is something into which many people put a great deal of work.  While the community games have not retained the glamour of the FAI or the GAA, many people are catered for in the less privileged and less developed sports.</P>
    <P>With regard to educational facilities, the Minister for Education and Science is examining the feasibility of increasing the size of sports halls in schools based on the number of pupils.  I urge the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> National lottery funding is a hot potato but I agree with the Minister's policy of giving larger grants to fewer clubs.  My club, Baltinglass, will shortly submit a very good proposal to the Minister. It has received funding in the past but it does an excellent job.  All people who work in a voluntary capacity with sporting groups deserve much praise.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Wall is present.  Wicklow deserve much of the credit for Kildare's recent success because they beat Kildare in 1991 who then thought they had reached the bottom.  It inspired them to seek out Mick O'Dwyer.  I know that day was not a happy one for Deputy Wall who suffered much pain and possibly abuse. However, he stuck with it and I congratulate him on his county's efforts even if they did not win.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which will place the Irish Sports Council on a statutory footing. There has been an <i>ad hoc</i> council since 1971, when Deputy O'Kennedy was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, to advise the Minister and the Government on matters related to sport.  It is also welcome that a Minister has direct responsibility for sport.  At £26 million, the allocation for 1998 is double the amount made available last year by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>There is a need for planning.  In Cork city, for example, there are two running tracks.  In Dublin there is a tendency for sporting bodies to proceed with their own plans.  The GAA and the IRFU have developed their own stadia and the FAI is talking about doing likewise even though the idea of a national stadium has been mooted.  Why can facilities not be shared?  On completion of the all-Ireland football championship the facilities at Croke Park are not heavily used until the commencement of the championship.  If rock concerts, boxing matches, American football and compromise rules matches can be held there, why not other sports?  What are the Minister's views on a national stadium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a particular interest in minority sports for which he has provided national lottery funding.  Members have been lobbied by bridge clubs, a game that is played by an enormous number of people.  The community games which cater for a wide range of sports and which have been very successful are now sponsored by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The GAA should be funded on the basis that it provides facilities at parish level.  Sums as small as £10,000 are required to develop sportsfields, although larger amounts will be required to develop various stadia.  The Connacht Council has made a strong case for Tuam stadium which the people of Galway regard as the home of football.  The Minister has met the people involved.  He had the <Col N="275" /> opportunity to attend the Connacht football final replay on 1 August when Galway eventually managed to get out of Connacht.  Earlier that day he opened a golf course in Dunmore.  One can have all the facilities in the world but without voluntary workers and community leaders success will not be achieved.  In this regard there is a need to fund coaching programmes.</P>
    <P>There is considerable interest throughout the country but particularly in Galway in the 50-metre swimming pool, in respect of which the project brief has been issued to nine qualified candidates.  Galway Corporation has reminded the Minister that he spent some of his college days in Galway, in the hope that he will look favourably on its request that the pool be located there.  The issue of a joint venture should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Sport and health have been linked.  There is an old saying that prevention is better than cure.  Young people in particular should be encouraged to adopt more healthy lifestyles by participating in sporting activities such as cycling, walking and jogging in which there is now a greater interest.</P>
    <P>During their stay in Ireland some 900,000 foreign visitors take part in sporting activities promoted by the sports and leisure industry in which over 18,000 people are employed.  Since we cannot promise them sunshine, activities such as surfing, diving, sailboarding, canoeing and fishing should be promoted aggressively.</P>
    <P>As a result of allegations concerning the taking of drugs, sports such as swimming, athletics and, more recently, rugby have attracted bad publicity. Even schoolboy rugby has been affected.  These allegations must be investigated and those who break the law brought to justice.</P>
    <P>In Dublin a number of projects are being promoted to encourage older people to take part in sporting activities which are considered more leisurely, such as bowling, croquet and pitch and putt.  Local authorities have a role to play in promoting such activities.</P>
    <P>Physical education should be part of the primary school curriculum in respect of which in-service training courses should be provided for teachers.  It has been said that because the majority of primary teachers are female physical education is not being promoted.  This is not true. In my student days the professor of physical education continually emphasised the involvement of female teachers not just in traditional games but also in basketball and camogie.  Parents also have a role to play.  One of the fastest growing sports is ladies' football.  The recent all-Ireland ladies' football final which was televised live was an exciting affair.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme under which our elite athletes are supported to improve their world rankings.  The late Noel Carroll was one of the great sporting heroes when I attended second and third level.  I pay tribute to these athletes for the great work they have done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House and I hope Government funding will be available to promote sport throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the Irish Sports Council as a statutory body, the Irish Sports Council to promote and encourage the development of sport.  This follows directly on the Government's commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium to establish a new sports council.  Moreover, the report published in 1997 by the national sports strategy group entitled Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland &mdash; Sport in Ireland 1997-2006 and Beyond also recommended that legislation be introduced to set up a sports council.  This report was the end product of a detailed consultation process within the sports sector.</P>
      <P>Sports councils have existed since 1978 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in various forms and have acted as advisory bodies to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Government on matters related to sport.  This new legislation will put such a council on a statutory basis for the first time ever and will provide for a major broadening of its role beyond that of advising, to encompass executive functions including a number currently being fulfilled by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The establishment of this sports council is just one of the many significant developments in sport since this Government's decision to create the first full-time Cabinet position for sport in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Before looking at some of the broader aspects of programmes which at present assist the development of sport I will comment on some of the provisions of the Irish Sports Council Bill which is before the House.</P>
      <P>Section 6 sets out the functions of the new sports council which include the following: to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and achievement of excellence therein; to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and for co-ordinating their implementation; to facilitate standards of good conduct and fair play in competitive sport through the promulgation of guidelines and codes of practice; to initiate and encourage research into sport and; to take appropriate action to combat doping in sport.  This last power coincides with Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme which was launched in June of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These major initiatives underline the commitment of the Government to create a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means as well as ratifying the spirit and letter of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention 1989, which Ireland signed in 1992.  Giving power to the Irish Sports Council to deal with the problem of doping in sport will complement the <Col N="277" /> national sports anti-doping programme.  Details of this national sports anti-doping programme have already been circulated to all the concerned governing bodies in sport.  This programme will incorporate testing, education and research.  The programme will be voluntary in nature but funding will be withheld from any national governing body or individual athlete opting out of participation in the programme or breaking any element of the rules governing its operation.  I welcome the fact that this Bill gives the new Irish Sports Council the function, power and structure to participate actively and constructively in the battle against doping in sport.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 the sports council is empowered to support and assist sport across the sporting spectrum to the benefit of outstanding sportspersons and teams as well as ordinary people who wish to take part in sport for recreation and enjoyment regardless of age, sex or ability.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the council with specific functions which have as their main aims the promotion of excellence in competitive sport and the encouragement of greater participation in sport. These aims are interlocked and should be seen as a cohesive force for the sports council.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council cannot succeed in isolation from other Government policies being implemented in the area of sport.  Appropriate financial resources must be made available if the objectives laid down by the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium are to be achieved.  The Government has shown a strong commitment to achieving these objectives.  The 1998 allocation for sports developments in Ireland stands at £26 million which is double the previous year's allocation.</P>
    <P>I will now address some specific initiatives in the spending estimates for sports development in Ireland for the year 1998.  I note that £1.575 million is being spent on the sports capital programme in 1998 and that £2.4 million is being spent on the recreational facilities scheme in 1998.  These schemes are highly important for the development and improvement of sports facilities nationwide.  There is an enormous demand from community and sporting groups throughout the country to secure co-financing assistance for various projects under either of these two initiatives. I strongly urge the Government to increase the annual financial allocations under the sports capital programme and the recreational facilities scheme for the year 1999 to cater for the high demand for financial assistance under these programmes. It would certainly help to implement the objectives of the Government in the area of sports development nationwide.  Sport is an integral part of every community in Ireland and has an ability to touch the daily lives of every one of us.  It can improve the quality of our lives and contribute to the building of a stronger community spirit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent initiative taken by the Minister for Education and Science relating to the possible inclusion of physical education as a <Col N="278" /> leaving certificate subject.  The National Council for Curriculum Assessment is looking into this matter.  Many students who excel at physical activity may not excel in the more traditional subjects. In our current system students who wish to have their physical aptitudes and interests recognised have no access to formal recognition. Students should have their achievements in all disciplines recognised in their leaving certificates. The students who display a keen interest and talent in physical education should receive the same recognition in the leaving certificate as an artist or musician.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of physical education in the leaving certificate syllabus will allow students to graduate from post primary schools with a more comprehensive profile of attainment.  Not only would students benefit from this innovation but so would teachers.  The process involved in preparing for and delivering a leaving certificate course will provide stimulus towards professional development for the physical education teacher. The inclusion of the subject within the examination system will provide motivation and a welcome professional challenge for the teacher.  This view is strongly supported by the Physical Education Association of Ireland and a motion to the effect that physical education be a subject for certification was passed overwhelmingly at their AGM in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Department of Physical Education and Sports Science at the University of Limerick also supports the inclusion of physical education as a leaving certificate subject and is actively considering the implications such a move might have for policy and practice within the Department of Education and Science.  International reports point to the increased levels of motivation among those students who have the opportunity to study physical education in greater depth.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that reservations may exist at some levels and that problems of implementation may arise.  No major innovation is without potential pitfalls.  However, it is encouraging to note that in England and Wales the introduction of physical education as an A level subject has brought a steady and dramatic increase in the number of students taking the examination.  The situation in Scotland is even more encouraging. Since standard grade physical education was introduced in 1988 the growth in the popularity of the programme has been remarkable.  The programme was offered by 191 schools in 1990 and this figure had increased to 387 in 1996.</P>
    <P>I know previous sports councils have been in discussion from time to time with the Department of Education and Science on this subject and I hope the new Sports Council will support the Government's plans to introduce physical education as a secondary school subject in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  The Labour Party has some reservations about this Bill, which my colleague, Deputy Ferris, outlined.  Despite our <Col N="279" /> reservations, we are pleased that at last we have legislation before the House which establishes a statutory sports council.  I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation.  I also want to put on record my appreciation of the role played by Deputy Allen and the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, in progressing sports policy in Ireland.  Without their work in the Department of Education, I doubt if this legislation would have emerged.</P>
      <P>The new sports council established by this Bill will have a central role in society.  During this debate many Deputies referred to the cherished place of sport in society.  Sport plays a central role in community life in every parish, town and city. It is a testament to the determination and dedication of people that so many clubs and organisations are thriving.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, in particular, the facilities available to sports clubs have improved significantly. This is partly due to the increased funding available to sport through the national lottery.  The cornerstone of this development, however, is the amount of time and talent which people voluntarily give to sport.  Every day of the week, every week of the year, thousands of people give up their free time to train teams, develop clubs, repair facilities, raise moneys and undertake many other necessary tasks to keep sports clubs thriving.</P>
      <P>One of the main tasks of the new sports council will be to assist and encourage in every way possible this huge voluntary effort.  It is essential that it is relevant to sports clubs throughout the country. The Minister must ensure that small local clubs are represented on the council.  It is imperative that the work done at local level by sports clubs and organisations is recognised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Recently we witnessed a huge gap between national sports policy and its effect at grass roots level.  In the aftermath of the shocking Derry O'Rourke case, the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation undertook a review of the implementation of the voluntary code of ethics in clubs.  This timely and important work by the committee demonstrated the huge gap between national sports policy and its effect on sports groups.  I compliment the Minister on his efforts in dealing with that shocking case.</P>
      <P>Many sporting organisations outlined to the committee their difficulty in implementing the code of ethics.  Little assistance was given to individual clubs to help them to implement it.  Due to a lack of co-ordination, this crucially important code of ethics was not fully effective at grass roots level.  Everyone involved in sport should learn from this important lesson.  I hope the sports council will implement a strategy to ensure that individual clubs can seek assistance and advice on the implementation of such codes and standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sports council and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation should develop sports facilities in schools and colleges.  Many <Col N="280" /> schools and colleges are aligned to one particular sport, whether Gaelic football, rugby or soccer, but that does not allow students to develop an interest in another sport.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Education and Science should ensure that a directory of sports organisations is available in school and college libraries.</P>
    <P>Videos of particular sports should also be available so that students who are not interested in the sport promoted by the school can decide if they would like to participate in another sport or become involved in a sporting organisation.  This would give students a wider choice of sporting activities and ensure that they can develop links with other sports which are not available to them at present.  I ask the Minister and the Department of Education and Science to consider providing such facilities in schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties of our system of public administration is co-ordination between Departments. A current example of this is Devoy Bar-racks in Naas where the Department of Defence must defer a decision on the use of the site until the Department of Education and Science carries out an assessment.  Meanwhile, St. David's Boxing Club, which has used the facilities in Devoy Barracks for over 40 years, is locked out.  This is causing huge problems for the club and its members.</P>
    <P>There must be a close link between schools and sports clubs if we are to ensure that active participation in sport continues to flourish.  The use of pitches, gyms and other facilities in schools must be at the top of the agenda.  Sporting clubs should also ensure that their facilities are available to schools in their areas, particularly during school hours, as many of them are not normally used until evening.  We must use all sports facilities to their maximum so that our children and future generations will be able to develop physically and mentally and to choose the sport in which they wish to participate.</P>
    <P>There must be close liaison between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in terms of the promotion and development of sport in schools.  Everything possible must be done to develop links between sporting clubs and the two Departments.  In many cases small things, such as insurance and caretaker problems, prevent clubs from using school facilities and <i>vice versa.</i>  They should be sorted out so that our attention is focused on the development of sport.  Children must not be prevented from participating in sport because of red tape.</P>
    <P>In my experience many children lose interest in sport in secondary school.  This is due to many factors.  Some children join a peer group where sport is not cool, while others take up part-time work which affects their ability to make time for sport.  Secondary school pupils are subject to great pressure.  Unfortunately, their passion for and love of sport often falls victim to this pressure. <Col N="281" /> The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Education and Science must tackle this serious problem. Many 13 and 14 year old children who are good at sport at underage level disappear from the sport once they go to secondary school.  That is because of pressure of examinations and because they are trying to earn an extra few pounds to further their education.  We do not seem to be able to do anything to overcome that problem.  I hope the new sports council, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Education and Science try to overcome this major problem in the development of the sporting ideal for young people.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies said physical education and sport are not curriculum subjects in secondary schools which is a serious failing.  Courses in sport should be part of the curriculum up to the leaving certificate.  There is wide scope for the Department to design an attractive and challenging curriculum subject which could include sports administration, sports injuries and treatment, a history of sport in Ireland and possibly sports journalism and photo-journalism.  This would enable those who are not physically able to partake in sport to become involved and perhaps become administrators, physiotherapists or sports photographers.  They could then become involved in sport and be part of the local community.</P>
    <P>Too often we see children who, because of a physical disability or their outlook on life, do not become involved in sport in school or the community. If something were done about this these children could play an important part in local clubs.  I hope the council and the Department examine this proposal to ensure there is not such a fall-out in sport in second level schools.  It would enhance the image of sport in many of our secondary schools and encourage children to maintain and develop an interest in sport at a time when so many other attractions and distractions are competing for their time and attention.  I would appreciate if the Minister would respond to this in his summing up.</P>
    <P>I would also like the council to examine the issue of the Special Olympics and sports and recreational facilities for people with disabilities.  We have spoken about the elite of sport, but we must also look at the other end of the spectrum.  It is enjoyable to see people with a disabilities winning races or participating in games.  We must ensure their ability to partake is not forgotten in our efforts to ensure we have an elite sports organisation. While that is great for Ireland's image, we must not overlook the disabled who want to be part of sport although the facilities may not be available.  I ask the Minister to ensure the sports council conducts a survey so that everything possible is done to provide facilities for those who are not part of the sporting elite.</P>
    <P>The Community Games are a major part of sporting life as they cover a wide spectrum of sport ranging from passive sport, such as chess and draughts, to the more physical.  The Irish <Col N="282" /> Committee of Credit Unions have undertaken a great initiative in funding the games.  However, they need to be developed further.  I hope the council and the Department will ensure the games are not strapped for funds as they are a vital component in ensuring the further development of our recreational facilities.  I also ask the sports council to investigate the application for recognition by the Irish Bridge Union.  I am sure the council will give it due consideration.</P>
    <P>As someone involved in the GAA, I welcomed the decision to grant Croke Park funding of £20 million.  However, the Minister must now look at the proposed Irish stadia, the building of which is becoming more fragmented.  The IRFU, the FAI, the Government and the GAA are all trying to build massive stadia in Dublin.  These organisations must discuss this matter with the Minister to ensure taxpayers receive the maximum benefit from the Government money which is contributing to the design of these stadia.  The economic implications of so many stadia being built is worrying.  We should examine this before it goes too far.  In a time of peace, it is possible to co-ordinate all sports bodies and develop stadia which will meet the country's requirements for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Morton Stadium in Santry has been overlooked although it probably gave us the best sporting return in the past 30 or 40 years.  Many world records were broken there in the 1950s and 1960s by world class athletes such as Elliot, Lincoln and Thomas and our own Ronnie Delaney and Noel Carroll, who sadly passed away last week.  However, we do not develop this facility despite the continual crop of Irish athletes who have graced international athletics.  It is good to see Catherina McKiernan and Sonia O'Sullivan continue this great tradition.  However, we have not developed a facility to attract world class athletes to Dublin.  Monthly athletic meetings are held all over Europe, yet Dublin is not part of that scene because we cannot match the facilities in Berlin and elsewhere.  I ask the Minister to examine this.  It is time to bring together the organisations and associations rather than build stadia in a fragmented manner.  We are proposing to build four or five when one or two would suffice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I know the council will do what is right for the many associations involved.  I hope the Minister takes on board my points as regards the curriculum, people with disabilities and the stadia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Johnny Brady and Eoin Ryan.  I welcome this Bill.  It is astonishing that this is the first time a sports council will be put on a statutory basis considering that a sports council in one guise or another has been in operation since 1970. It is a long overdue measure.  It is appropriate that the Minister acknowledged the role played by his predecessors as sport should bring us together and should not be subject to political <Col N="283" /> division.  I commend the other speakers on their constructive and positive contributions and on recognising the achievements of the Minister and his predecessors.</P>
      <P>It has been said so often that it is virtually a cliché by now, but sport touches us all and plays an extraordinarily important role in all our lives. It is important in the development of the young that they have healthy recreational outlets.  One of the biggest problems in modern life is that nothing has filled a role previously played by sport.  Christian brothers and nuns marched children into cold, windy, wet fields where they were made at least to engage their energies, but that has almost become a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>Not only has sport a role in personal development, it also has an extraordinary capacity to lift the nation.  We all remember sporting occasions when we were uniquely proud of the prowess and achievements of the sportspeople of our small nation.  Sport also plays an important role at local level, giving a sense of pride in place, binding communities together and giving small communities an opportunity to make their mark.  For all these reasons, this legislation is singularly important.</P>
      <P>The Minister and other speakers touched on a number of issues in their contributions.  The central Government allocation for sports is almost derisory.  Given that we as a nation admire sporting prowess, it is remarkable that successive Governments, including those in which my party has played a major part, have failed to recognise in a tangible sense the value of sport and its place in the nation's life.  It is therefore particularly welcome that this year's allocation is double that of last year.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government is committed to improving overall sports funding but my anxiety is that we should prudently use this money.  It is of grave concern to me, and I am sure to other Members, that we are entering an era of dramatic population change, particularly in the greater Dublin area including counties like Wicklow, Louth and Meath.  There is severe pressure for new housing development and the State and the EU are making a huge investment in infrastructure, but one area of infrastructure which is continually overlooked is recreational and sporting facilities.  It is not good enough that we invest in road, sewerage and occasionally in schools but not in sport.  We allow sporting investment to find its own level some years after the population comes into an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have first hand experience of this in Greystones. In the early 1980s, An Foras Forbatha suggested that 30 acres of land in the town should be brought into public ownership specifically for sport and recreation.  The town has had huge infrastructural investment and its population has trebled but public authorities have not invested one penny in sporting or recreational facilities. The only investment in sport has been by private individuals through the tennis club, the rugby <Col N="284" /> club, the Éire Óg GAA club and the soccer clubs. This is not good enough.  Given that the new development plan projects that the town's population will double again, it makes no sense for local and national government to ignore the needs of Greystones.  The population of the nearby town of Kilcoole is forecast almost to double in the years ahead also, yet it has been impossible to get grant assistance for any sports club there.  It would make extremely good sense and would be a good investment for the State to put money into sporting infrastructure in growing areas.  My colleagues from Dublin and Meath will be able to make similar pleas on behalf of their own areas.</P>
    <P>It is fine to put money into big projects and I do not disagree with the suggestion that we need prestigious, central national locations but it is also vital to put money into local projects.  It is not good enough that people who volunteer their time to local sporting clubs spend the greater portion of their energy in race nights, fund raising raffles and draws to keep their heads above water.  There must be a radical re-appraisal of how funding is provided to organisations and of the needs of growing areas.  If we do not invest in young people in towns whose populations are doubling and trebling, we will have to invest in correctional action, which makes no sense.  I welcome the Government's recognition of sport in doubling last year's allocation but a radical approach should be taken to the manner in which it is spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the issue of drugs in sport.  The increasing commercialisation and pressure to commercialise, and increasing competitiveness, have created a drugs culture.  It is shocking to see in sports stores materials which may not be proscribed substances but which put pressure on an individual's physique to produce artificial results.  I recently visited a sports centre in France and was stunned by the extraordinarily focussed diets, which create a view of how sporting excellence should be achieved.  Sport and diet are intimately connected but something must be done to reduce the pressure.  I welcome the Minister's introduction of the first ever national sports anti-doping initiative and the fact that he will use leverage to ensure sporting bodies and individual sportspeople will wholeheartedly sign up to it. The menace of drugs has destroyed international sport, producing a commercial activity which is far removed from what it should be.  It destroys not only the sport but sportspeople.</P>
    <P>A number of individual sports have been mentioned, including swimming.  There was concern that due recognition was not given to this area but my concern is with its future health as an activity.  Swimming has gone through an appalling period.  The Minister has handled the major problems extremely well but it is left with an indelible taint.  As a parent of four young persons I am horrified at some of the revelations and I am sure Members share that horror.  An effective national organisation and a comprehensive code must be <Col N="285" /> put in place.  There is a need for strong vigilance, because parents' and young people's confidence in swimming must be rebuilt.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will forgive me for being parochial but I could not mention swimming without saying that County Wicklow, with a population of 104,000, has no publicly operated swimming pools.  Funding is earmarked for pools in Arklow and Wicklow but they are being brought on stream at a glacial pace.  One cannot have vibrant swimming, the most healthy of activities, if one has neither the facilities nor a comprehensive, well policed code.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices in Cabinet to ensure there are no further hitches in bringing our pools into operation.  Every major town should have a swimming pool and it would make good sense for the State to provide the funding.</P>
    <P>The question of recognition for bridge has already been mentioned.  Bridge is a thriving activity, particularly in County Wicklow where there is a remarkable bridge centre in Greystones.  The Bridge Association's request for official recognition of bridge as a sporting activity should be granted.  Bridge is unique because it crosses social boundaries and gives an outlet to many people, old and young, who come together to enjoy this social activity.</P>
    <P>I endorse the points made about the use of facilities in schools and the possibility of developing a national stadium.  It is time a concerted effort was made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Hurling, a uniquely Irish sport, reaches a peak then wanes in areas of the country.  I urge the Minister to recognise the unique attributes of that sport, perhaps by way of special tax breaks for people who provide commercial sponsorship in the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has achieved a great deal despite the difficult issues with which he had to deal.  He has dealt with them in a sensitive manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.  Since coming into office, the Government has acknowledged the importance of sport to the people and to our economy.  I pay tribute to the thousands of volunteers in a variety of sporting organisations throughout the country who, through solid commitment and hard work, have developed sports of all types.  As a result of their time and energy this country has come to the fore in international competition.  They will now have the support of the Irish Sports Council.</P>
      <P>As we approach the 21st century sport will become an even more important factor in our daily lives.  It is a form of therapy and has an important part to play in a climate where the stresses and demands on every individual are increasing.  Active participation in any sport results in mental, physical and social benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being a spectator is also an occasion for social entertainment and an important channel of inter-personal <Col N="286" /> communication.  Many of us recall our first trip to a major sporting occasion &mdash; the sense of expectation, the impressive and welcoming sway of a happy crowd and the opportunity to see our heroes in person.  Inevitably, the transition from youthful participation to ageing spectator occurs all too quickly.  For these reasons it is important that sport is accessible to everybody. Rich, poor, young, old, able-bodied and disabled people alike must have access to a sport of their choice.  Bridge, for example, can be played by any age group and by the disabled, and I hope the Minister will recognise bridge as a sport.</P>
    <P>It is important that the new Irish Sports Council ensures that sport will be available to all citizens, irrespective of social circumstances, age or physical ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  All of us get an enormous return from any money invested in sport.  Nothing brings people together like sport, whether it is a Munster or All-Ireland final, horse racing or a rugby international at Lansdowne Road.  Rugby is a good example of that when one considers the problems that have plagued this island for a long time.  Rugby brought people together from all corners of the island without any mention of politics.  The players pulled on the green jersey and played their hearts out.  Nobody cared about their backgrounds because they were playing for Ireland, and there was always a great response from the crowd.  A rugby international, like many great sporting events, is a special occasion.</P>
      <P>The success of the Irish soccer team in the World Cup in Italy resulted in a boost for tourism here.  Prior to that success Italy was not regarded as a source of tourism for Ireland but large numbers of Italians come here and, according to Bord Fáilte, that is a direct result of the way our fans behaved in Italy a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>This Government gave a commitment to sport, as did the previous Government, and I am delighted the Bill to be brought forward by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will ensure all of us can watch major sporting events without having to pay for the privilege.  That is another important step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the carding system the Minister proposes to introduce for elite athletes.  That is important because Irish athletes have lost out over the years compared to athletes from other countries and the support they get.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to mention the late Noel Carroll, who died so tragically recently.  Noel was extremely successful as an athlete but he did not walk away from sport when that career came to an end.  He spent his whole life in athletics.  I had the good fortune to work with Noel on Dublin City Council and he was a true sportsman.  He had a great love of sport and his death is a great loss to all of us and to sport in general.  I am sure Noel would have supported the carding system for elite athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The Minister raised the question of a 50 metre pool in his contribution.  That project is essential and I hope it will go ahead.  Various Governments pushed this issue but for one reason or another it did not come to fruition.  I hope the Minister will see this important project through.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and Roderick Murphy on their handling of the recent problems in swimming.</P>
    <P>Sport begins at local level and we must invest in it at that level.  The Minister is examining a number of projects in my constituency including Clann na Gael and Fontenoy, but there are many other rowing and football clubs in the area which give enormous benefit to young and old alike. Will the Minister ensure the council provides funding at this level as well as for the major projects. Young athletes are nurtured at local level and they will be our heroes in the future.  It is vitally important, therefore, that encouragement is given at this level and that we develop those clubs because they represent the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It is important that sport, which is rarely debated due to pressure of work, scheduling problems, etc., should be discussed in the House from time to time.  As other Members stated, it is an important part of our society and I thank the Minister for affording us the opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers I pay tribute to Noel Carroll whom I knew well.  Noel dedicated his life to sport, held a clear philosophy on it and had a keen interest in all its forms.  He will be a major loss to sport in this country.  Noel always led by example and I marvelled at his enthusiasm to go running almost every morning in all types of weather.  His last turn was as good as his first and he ended his life in the way he would have wanted, namely, being active.</P>
      <P>I come from a sporting background and I was a physical education teacher before I entered the House.  It gives me great satisfaction to see the major progress we have made in recent years in terms of sports policy, the delivery of facilities, etc.  However, I was disappointed that during his contribution the Minister did not give due credit to his predecessor, Deputy Allen.  The Deputy is no longer in a position to accept the kudos for developing sport in Ireland but through his actions and the initiatives he put in place he paved the way for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On entering office as Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen identified the extraordinary lack of sporting policy.  As a Member of the Seanad from 1983 to 1987, I served as Government spokesperson on sport and I introduced a motion on its development.  A great deal of what is contained in the Bill formed part of that motion and I highlighted many of the issues raised by the Minister at that stage.  Unfortunately, my party was not in power between 1987 and 1994 and could do little about the matter <Col N="288" /> other than discussing it.  In 1987 I wrote an article for the <i>Irish Independent</i> in which I outlined most of what has been included in the Bill. Therefore, the concept of a statutory sports council has been in existence for some time and it is good that it is being included in legislation.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will put in place a policy and a schedule of work which will be additional to what is covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>To return to my point, Deputy Allen identified the lack of sports policy and acted to remedy the situation.  He decided there was a need to put in place a national plan for sport.  The Deputy showed great foresight when he approached John Treacy and informed him that he had a job for him to do.  Through his energy and enthusiasm, John Treacy tied the various strands together and ultimately developed a good report.  As Deputy Allen pointed out, over 400 detailed submissions were received from sporting organisations in connection with the production of the report Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland.  One of its key recommendations suggested the establishment of an Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis.  It is only right that we should recognise the work of Deputy Allen in bringing about the establishment of the council and I thank the Minister for finally putting it in place.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with a number of the statements made by the Minister.  I welcome the commitment to build a national 50 metre swimming pool.  We should be ashamed that such a facility does not exist in this country because it is unfair to Irish swimmers who have made major strides in their sport during the past ten years.  Irrespective of the cost involved, such a swimming pool must be provided. I know the Minister is a man of action and I urge him to make the provision of this facility a priority during his term of office.</P>
    <P>There are people who state that a 50-metre swimming pool will prove too costly to operate and that it would be better to build a number of smaller pools.  I disagree with that argument because I believe we need a national 50-metre swimming pool, not only for the use of national and international athletes but also for budding athletes.  Swimming is becoming increasingly popular as a sport.  I agree with other Members who stated that there should be a swimming pool in every town.  That is a great aspiration but we must begin at national level by providing a 50-metre pool.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government established a tendering system aimed at attracting developers to build a national 50-metre swimming pool.  I tabled a parliamentary question about it at the time only to be informed by the relevant Minister that it had been abandoned, an assertion which shocked not only me but also the entire swimming fraternity. I hope that will not happen in this instance.  The financial constraints during that period no longer obtain and, given the surplus funds currently available, now is the time to build the pool before <Col N="289" /> the tide changes once more.  I urge the Minister to provide a 50-metre pool and I will support any moves he makes in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the location of a national 50-metre swimming pool, I am aware that the Minister is awaiting tenders which should be received by the end of the month.  I would favour its being situated in Limerick, close to the National Training Centre, but I accept that it might be more useful to build it in Dublin.  The pool could be regularly opened to the public on an entry fee basis.  The cost of maintaining it could be met by encouraging people to take out memberships, etc.  From experience I know it is difficult to find somewhere to swim in Dublin and if a pool of this kind was situated in the city it would attract great support from people who live here and those who visit on business.</P>
    <P>I promoted the idea of constructing a national sports stadium on a number of occasions before the advent of major investment in Croke Park and minor investments at various other stadia. However, I believe a national sports stadium, incorporating a national indoor stadium, could still play an important role.  At various stages in the past when they served in Government, Deputies Fahey and O'Rourke announced the development of a national sports stadium but no progress was made in that regard.  I recall appearing on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; with Deputy Fahey who stated that two thirds of the necessary land had been purchased, that the stadium would be built and that he was shocked that I should imply this would not happen.  However, I was correct because construction of the stadium did not proceed. As in the last election, Deputy Fahey made a promise he did not keep.  Perhaps what he did was good in terms of policy making but approximately £3.5 million was spent on the acquisition of a site, consultancy fees, etc., and in the end nothing happened.  I hope that current moves to develop a national sports stadium are genuine and not part of another charade.</P>
    <P>I suggest that on the site on which a national outdoor sports stadium is eventually built facilities for a national indoor stadium and a rehabilitation centre for injured athletes could be provided. There is a major lack of injury treatment centres for athletes.  The Minister will be aware of this lack from his medical experience and I am aware of it from my active involvement in training and coaching football teams.  There is no place to send injured athletes for a proper diagnosis. There are a number of good physiotherapists but they cannot make a diagnosis and, at times, can do more harm than good by applying a massage or heat treatment to injuries which may need a different type of treatment such as rest or even surgery.  I remind the Minister and his officials of a report in the 1980s which recommended setting up an injuries centre.  There is a need for such a centre.  Some of our top athletes in all sports had their careers curtailed due to the lack of proper diagnosis and treatment.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that whole area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> It is important that regional centres of quality be provided.  No doubt a national sports stadium would be sited in Dublin.  The original sports report suggested setting up a national stadium and regional stadia but they did not transpire. Despite major funds accruing from the national lottery, funds are not available in sport.  There are many smaller facilities which are not of the high quality needed at this time.  The purpose of the national lottery, when set up, was primarily to fund sport.  On the other hand people expected to make about £7 million to £9 million from it.  It was used for health and education purposes in the 1980s when the economy was not going well. More lottery funds should be committed to sport. The new national sports council must be properly funded.</P>
    <P>An area in which I have particular interest is physical education in schools.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister said the Department of Education and Science is developing initiatives to enhance physical education and sport in schools and that Department is piloting a new PE curriculum in selected schools throughout the country. When replying, will the Minister expand on that programme?</P>
    <P>I recall carrying out a national survey in primary and secondary schools in the early 1990s to which I got a good response from very frustrated principals throughout the country.  I discovered that 30 per cent of primary schools had no physical education.  They had no facilities, except the school yard which could not be used in all weathers.  Another 30 per cent had occasional physical education.  This indicated that more than 50 per cent of young people do not have PE on a weekly basis, not to mention on a daily basis.  The curriculum guidelines recommend physical education of two hours per week for primary school children.</P>
    <P>In a follow-up survey in secondary schools I found that 40 per cent of leaving certificate students had no physical education whatsoever. We can have all the grandiose ideas about national sports councils and elite athletes but unless physical education is provided in the schools the population will be less healthy and will be unfit.  This is already happening.  One has only to look at children's posture.  Many children do not eat properly, some are overweight and do not get enough exercise.  They are bused to school while others are driven by their parents.  One rarely sees a youngster riding a bicycle or walking to school as we did in the past.  At home in the evenings they do not have the same type of work which we had.  All these various activities which people did previously, and which were part of their life, are gone.  The reality is that they are not fit, and people generally are not as healthy as in the past.  The only way to compensate for that is to provide physical education in schools.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to make that a priority.  While it is a Department of Education and Science function, the Minister will <Col N="291" /> have to work closely with his colleague to ensure it is provided.</P>
    <P>Where community facilities are being provided, such as community halls, they should be located as close as possible to schools.  I was in Holy Family School, Tralee this week.  About 50 yards from the school in Spa Road, Tralee, there is a fine sporting facility called &ldquo;Come and Use It&rdquo;.  The school uses it daily and has a physical education programme.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there are examples of community centres approximately a mile from the school.  Teachers cannot march children to the community centre; it would take up too much time.  If possible, community centres should be provided on the school grounds or in close proximity to the school.  This would enable it be used during the day as well as at night.  There should be more rationalisation of facilities.</P>
    <P>In primary schools there is no reason there would not be shared professional physical education teachers as is the case with the remedial teachers.  Small schools could share facilities.  I would have no objection to FÁS employees taking classes provided they are experts in football, soccer or hurling.  A proper physical programme involves more than kicking a ball; it includes diet, hygiene, sex education &mdash; it is a totality of experience. Experts are needed to provide that.  Physical education experts can set up a programme with the schools.  That matter should be seriously considered.  There is major pressure for facilities in the primary school system.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the great possibilities in the area of sport for job creation.  I am aware of a number of walking clubs which bring walkers into County Kerry.  It is bigger than golf and has more potential given that one cannot get on the golf courses.  The terrain in County Kerry, as in the Minister's county offers great outdoor opportunities to visitors.  Given the Minister's portfolio which includes tourism he can combine both activities.</P>
    <P>The new carding scheme is an excellent one which will enable athletes to avail of various services and so on.  I compliment the Minister on introducing it but perhaps it could be expanded to other sports and to the top sports people in Gaelic football, soccer and rugby.  I understand it is confined to individual sports.  It may be difficult to have the scheme expanded but perhaps the Minister would consider it and refer to it when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased at the opportunity to contribute.  The purpose of the Bill is to set up the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis.  We have had sports councils for a number of years which acted in an advisory capacity.  I am glad this is now happening given that it is a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. This is the first time a Department has had the word &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in its title.  That is a recognition of what the Government has promised and what it <Col N="292" /> intends to do for sport and I hope that will be carried through.</P>
      <P>The Minister has secured $26 million for sports funding.  While that is a significant figure, it is relatively small.  I hope that by the end of his term of office he will be able to look back and see an upward line on a graph of Government expenditure on sport.  Money spent on sport and recreation is money spent on preventative medicine. The sum of £26 million is small compared to the more than £3 billion that is spent on health care annually.  Some people will get ill and develop health problems and as they grow older they tend to have more health problems, but many of them bring these problems on themselves through over-eating, over-drinking, smoking and not having a healthy way of life.  If we can encourage more people to participate in sport, it would not only provide them with amusement but improve their health.</P>
      <P>Sport has always been there.  It has been at the cornerstone of Irish life and has been based on volunteer effort.  Many people slave away and do great work for their local clubs and communities. If their work is recognised at all, it is only at a local level.  Most people have got involved in sport through their home life or at school.  I got involved in sport through my home life.  The Christian Brothers schools I attended were marvellous at initially dragging people out to participate in sport and then they grew to have a love of it.  Many pupils tried to get out of sports on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons and many people are slow to develop a love of sport.  They need to be pushed and dragged out to participate in it.  Initially sport may seem to be a chore, but in later life people can grow to love it.</P>
      <P>The sports scene has changed in schools.  There are PE teachers at second level, although there are not nearly enough of them, but PE and sport are only given token recognition at primary level. This does not come under the Minister's remit, but I hope more PE teachers will be appointed at primary and secondary level in years to come. Many of what are supposed to pass for recreational halls in local schools in my constituency are pathetic and not appropriate for recreational sports.  However, every school does not need a £1 million hall.  If such halls are well located in urban areas, they can cater for a number of schools. That may be the appropriate way to proceed, although schools like to have their own halls and parishes like to have community halls.  If facilities are properly co-ordinated it is not necessary for every parish to have a community hall, but more halls should be built.  They should be properly staffed, run and resourced to serve the needs of the local community and develop in young people a love of recreation, healthy living and sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many people sport is initially a bit of fun and too much competition should not be introduced too soon.  When one of my children was participating in a road race some years ago, I was horrified to see some of my near neighbours freaking out, roaring and screaming at their <Col N="293" /> young sons and daughters to go faster.  I thought that was over the top, but their children may have become competitive runners and mine did not.</P>
    <P>There may have been some logic in what they did.  Initially sport should be for fun, for entertainment and the promotion of health and competition should come later.  For many people sport will never become competitive and they participate in it for recreational purposes, but as one improves in a sport, one may want to represent one's club, county or country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill and some aspects of life today.  Sport has increasingly become more focused on the big event on TV, be it in Croke Park, a national stadium or the Olympic Games.  These are focal points and I support Government plans to fund those bodies. I hope its plans for a national stadium will work out.  As well as focusing on big events, the majority of people view sport as an entertainment and a recreational activity and if they become good at a sport they can participate at competitive level.  I notice the first objective of the sports council is to promote competition and the second is to promote recreation.  I hope the order in which those objectives are listed is not significant. We must not forget that many thousands of people participate in sport at all levels for recreational purposes.  People voluntarily give of their time and while some beaver away in well resourced clubs, others beaver away in clubs that are not so well resourced.  Many people look after young soccer teams on Saturday mornings and do marvellous work, particularly in disadvantaged areas where life is a struggle.  They may bring the children to matches on Saturday, organise training on one or two evenings a week and fund-raise for their clubs by selling tickets in the pub on a Friday night.  While I support the spending of money on national projects and elite athletes, we must not forget that other level, particularly in disadvantaged areas, where a small allocation for the administration of local clubs can make an enormous difference.</P>
    <P>There are large numbers involved in sport, including those who participate in it, others who coach, administer clubs and those in the background who help out.  Some people who voluntarily gave of their time to help young people in sport are now almost afraid to become involved because of sexual abuse claims in sport, but that is an aspect of modern life of which we must be aware.  I hope it will not discourage people who have given freely of their time and those who continue to do so to coach children in sport.</P>
    <P>Sport is of great value in promoting physical and mental health and generating a team spirit in the young and not so young.  I do not want to dwell on Italia '90 when there was almost national frenzy with the level of support for our team.  The ability of sport, whether at club or community level, to raise the spirit and morale of the individual and the community is tremendous.  Young people need to follow role models and they like to participate in sport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I progressed from soccer and the GAA to cricket and tennis.  I was involved in tennis for many years.  I was more involved in running the club than in playing tennis and if I had spent more time playing I would have been better at it. I remember that every year after Wimbledon many people, who were young and not so young, came to the club for a few weeks to give it a lash. We thought we would have to close the club membership but that was not necessary because many of those people drifted away after a few weeks, perhaps because people like me did not give them enough coaching or time.  A great deal of sport is not as easy as it might look on television. Much time, energy, effort and commitment is required before one reaches a level where the sport becomes enjoyable to begin with.  When that stage is reached one can take it from there.</P>
    <P>Life has changed greatly in recent years.  In disadvantaged pockets in my constituency children will not become involved in sport.  I do not understand this.  They will stand outside community halls every night, light a fire against the outside wall and drink from their cans rather than go inside.  Legend has it that on one occasion people inside running a CE scheme tried to encourage them to play in the indoor arena.  The children only agreed on the basis that there would be a &ldquo;diggin&rdquo;' match outside one night to be followed by a football match indoors the following night. The overall result was a draw but because one team player suffered a broken arm his team was deemed to be the loser.</P>
    <P>Many children in disadvantaged areas will stay outside community centres rather than go inside. What has gone wrong?  In the past many sports stars, especially soccer stars, did not have third level education.  Why is it that 30 years ago children from poor areas became great soccer players and achieved success in England while this is not happening today?  These children appear to have opted out of society and sport.  If the school curriculum is of no interest to them an alternative system should be established.  If they did nothing only received football coaching all day it might make men out of some of them and offer them a career with their feet even if they could not spell or write.</P>
    <P>Something has gone terribly wrong in this area and I do not know what it is.  I am at a loss because on the football field, tennis court or boxing ring background does not matter.  People let their talents speak.  Commitments have been made to disadvantaged areas.  I hope the Government and its agencies will provide sports facilitators and helpers because the volunteers are not in these areas.  The fathers are not there although the mothers might be.  However, they face so many problems that clubs find it difficult to get volunteers to run sports.  Those that are available are pressed to raise money to keep going.  The State and local authorities must provide people who will act as substitute parents and will try to get children involved in sport, give them the love of it, get them into competitive levels and see if <Col N="295" /> they can get careers out of it.  Small amounts of funding at local level is essential, especially in poor areas.  For example, I have been told that if children could get football boots they would become involved.</P>
    <P>At another level sport is huge business.  There is too much emphasis on the big clubs, such as Manchester United, and merchandising.  The Minister is also Minister for tourism and the link between sport and tourism must be nurtured. While some may condemn as obscene the wages paid to sports stars, it is hoped this will encourage children to become involved.  However, this does not appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>I am nervous that because so much sport is on television too many people will equate sport with sitting in front of television and enjoying it with a pint in the hand.  That is marvellous &mdash; we all enjoy doing it &mdash; but we must not allow interest in watching sport to take over from active participation.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to golfing and walking holidays.  There is a great deal to be gained in tourism from these activities.  We should have a major sporting event every year which will bring visitors to the country.  It does not have to be a big spectator event.  A couple of years ago a rugby or tennis event for players who were over 40 years of age brought 7,000 or 8,000 visitors to the country.  Perhaps nobody watched them, but they were big spenders.  It was a good even from a tourism point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for gender balancing of not less than three men and three women as members of the council.  I spent most of my life in the tennis world where in Dublin an equal number of men and women were involved.  That is probably still the case.  However, sadly women have not been as involved as men in many other sports.  I hope the new sports council will improve matters.  If 75 per cent of those involved in sport are men while 25 per cent are women should there be the same gender balance?  If it is to be maintained, perhaps the size of the council should be increased from eight to ten.</P>
    <P>While women may be expert in one sport &mdash; I know many of them &mdash; there is a greater range of expertise in a number of sports among men.  I have been involved in a number of sports.  The Bill provides that members of the council should have a wide experience of sports.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to bridge.  The Minister is also Minister for recreation.  Many activities, such as bridge, chess, dog showing and walking would probably come under this remit. Perhaps politics, community life and trade union activities would also be included. Occasionally I try to marry politics with walking. It is better than sitting in smoky back rooms.  Some people appreciate my endeavours, others do not.  Recreations and sports are marvellous. They get people away from their problems, whether they are very busy or are sitting at home bored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> I emphasise the problems facing the development of sports in disadvantaged areas.  I hope the sports council, the Minister or the Department will grapple with this issue.  The Government is committed to tackling the huge problem in disadvantaged areas through the youth facilities and services fund.  Two drug task forces are operating in my constituency.  I have pushed my own line in sport and other youth facilities but I do not know if I fully won the argument.  Community development should be generally service oriented rather than aimed at the 5 per cent of people who are lost &ldquo;no hopers&rdquo;.  I was hoping that the youth facilities and services fund would rather cater for the 95 per cent of those who are still sound and have a good chance of turning out as good citizens.</P>
    <P>I hope the council and the Minister will pay special attention to disadvantaged areas.  There is huge potential in doing so as it would help to combat crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should bring this legislation before the House.  As he said in his initial address, this is the first time sport has been recognised in the portfolio of a senior Minister.  I pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who initiated the preparatory work with the advisory groups and the <i>ad hoc</i> advisory council that worked with him under the chairmanship of John Treacy.  They did a huge amount of work in uncharted waters.</P>
      <P>The Bill is appropriate in that it comes at a time of great controversy in so many aspects of sporting activity.  Other speakers have mentioned the problem of drugs in sport, so that issue has been adequately dealt with.</P>
      <P>Sponsorship is another important issue that has arisen in professional and amateur branches of sport.  The Minister is facing a difficult task in trying to untangle the grip on sport of major spon-soring companies, including drink and tobacco firms.  They have contributed generously in the past and I do not take away from that.  However, they have essentially used sporting individuals, teams and occasions for advertising purposes. The Minister's difficulty will be in drawing to himself control of and advice to many sporting organisations and individuals, which may previously have been the prerogative of the financing and advertising companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the sports council on a statutory basis.  If, as stated, the purpose is to promote all aspects and types of sport then the Minister is facing a difficult task in selecting appointees to the board.  The chairperson, whoever that may be, will have to divorce him or herself from any individual sports he or she may have been involved in.  The level and direction at which they orientate the work, finances and promotion of the sports council will be important. The Bill states that eight other members of the <Col N="297" /> board will be appointed by the Minister.  I am sure various pressure groups have already made representations to the Minister to have members on the board.  I do not envy the Minister his task. When he makes his final announcement various people, including Members of the House, will target him because he appointed x, y or z for a particular reason.  The Minister's critics will claim they were appointed because they were powerful lobbyists and various other labels will be placed upon them, worthy or not.  I wish the Minister well in selecting and appointing the board.  It is a difficult task, especially because it will be the first sports council to be established in this country.</P>
    <P>While the initial <i>ad hoc</i> grouping has done much positive work in difficult circumstances, the task will be even greater now that we have people with statutory duties to perform.  The Minister should achieve the right balance and take into consideration the best and most professional people available, regardless of what commitment they may have given to a sporting organisation as individual sports people, or because of where they come from.  I am sure he will perform this juggling act very well.</P>
    <P>If the new council has power beyond an advisory role, it will be better placed to have a positive effect in developing a new sporting culture.  I hope the council can show itself at all times in future to be fair to all sporting organisations and the individuals involved.  Its ultimate success will depend on its capacity to perform that work.</P>
    <P>If the council ever shows a bias towards any individual sport or major sporting group or organisation, then it will have fallen into a trap and will find it very difficult to redirect itself.  It will have fallen at the first fence and it will be difficult for it to regain ground.  I hope, therefore, that the council's membership will, as far as possible, be representative of all sporting agencies and that only the most professional forward thinking people will have a voice to lead the development of the positive aspects of sport.  I emphasise the positive aspects because sport must be seen in a positive light.</P>
    <P>People are currently saying in the media and elsewhere that some sporting organisations and personalities have been guilty of abuse.  Thankfully, however, they are only a minor grouping. The vast number of people involved in sport have not been involved in abuse.  We have the highest participation ratio in sporting activities in Europe.  It is changing and there are reasons for that but participation is still at an unusually high level.</P>
    <P>I hope the sports council will be allowed to take positive initiatives of its own.  As the Minister emphasised in his initial address, it is important for a senior Minister at the Cabinet table not to be strangled by other Departments &mdash; I am talking particularly about the Department of Finance, which holds the purse strings.  The Minister will have a difficult task in obtaining finance for initiatives which all cost money.  The Minister will <Col N="298" /> have the initiative to undertake the work he wants to in his Department as regards the sports council.  In the development and activities of the sports council, the Minister will have to seek greater co-operation from the Department of Education and Science, because every sports person got their first introduction to sport through education at primary level.  It is there that sport is nurtured and developed, and it has developed against all the odds in the education system. Every representative here has, time and time again, made representations to the Department of Education and Science and the planners within that Department seeking funds for basic essential facilities for PE within the schools only to be told it is not a priority.  The Minister said this Government has made sport, the sports council and sporting activities a priority.  For the first time this prioritisation will deliver realistic goals to the people who have over the years sought the provision of adequate facilities in schools.  A new, large amalgamated second level community school was provided in Gort, County Galway, four or five years ago.  This is a very elaborate school that caters for about 600 students, but it has no facilities for gymnastics, PE or indoor games.  I, and many others who have represented the area in the past, are blue in the face asking why an educational institution like that lacks such an important facility.  If sport is a priority each and every school must be provided with a properly qualified professional PE teacher and the facilities to adequately develop rounded pupils, and this must be done on a phased basis, at second level to begin with.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science cannot deny its lack of commitment to physical education, despite its paper commitment to it, when it has only one PE inspector.  That is a disgrace and the Department has done nothing over the years to improve the situation.  The person who is charged with that responsibility has an impossible task, but she has done tremendous work despite the physical difficulties she encounters.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that PE should become an examination subject at second level.  Does this mean the Department of Education and Science is going to introduce another subject to the school curriculum on the cheap, on a shoestring, by instituting a pilot scheme?  That will not work as has been shown too often in the past.  It would be a pity if, now that we have a good initiative by Government, it was sidelined by the Department of Education and Science.  The Minister should contact that Department to see what it has planned, if anything, other than to torpedo the Minister's endeavours.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that school timetables in no way cater for the introduction of PE as a standard subject.  Currently a PE class is essentially a break, except in the case of certain schools where pioneering teachers have ensured a recognised slot for PE within their schools. Generally, because of other demands on the curriculum, <Col N="299" /> PE has been pushed aside.  I want to see it reinstated as a priority.</P>
    <P>There is the question of costs, including the cost in human endeavour.  Sport is usually pursued after school hours and the schools have to finance it themselves.  The need for finance for games, PE, gymnastics and so on within the school structure has to be recognised and not put on the back burner as has often happened in the past.  In that connection, there is a legitimate fear of litigation among teachers, parents and coaches who are involved in organising young people. One example I know of relates to a teacher supervising games during the course of which a serious injury occurred which resulted in a substantial claim.  The insurance company responsible for covering the injured student decided to settle rather than allow the case into court.  The implication of that was that the blame rested with the coach, the teacher supervising at the time. That is a serious situation and it has to be addressed if people are to become wholeheartedly involved in organising sports.  There has been a gradual withdrawal from involvement in sports because of the fear of being tarnished.  A settlement by an insurance company does not tell the whole story of what happened.  I ask the Minister to investigate that in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the question of professionalism and semi-professionalism in sport.  The difficulty is where to draw the line.  What sports will the council cater for?  Are we talking about all sports?  Are we talking about rugby, which has now become professional?  Are we talking about the GAA, hurling and football?  There is an increasing demand from players for some sort of compensation for their time and endeavour and the expenses they incur.  If such a payment is made, will the sport be classified as professional or semi-professional?  Where athletes have sponsorship and that is classed as a reward, is that professionalism? There are many questions to be addressed in this regard.  I hope that on Report Stage we will be able to tease out that aspect.</P>
    <P>With regard to membership of the council, last year at budget time the Minister and the Taoiseach allocated £20 million for the GAA.  I welcomed that wholeheartedly as being a positive contribution provided that the organisation, under the presidency of Joe McDonagh, would use it to deliver improvements in facilities to people involved at all levels of the organisation. That has been done and it has been seen to be of benefit to clubs and organisations involved in promoting Gaelic football and hurling at local level.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to provide finance and to then be labelled in the same way the Minister for Finance was labelled the GAA man for providing funding for the GAA.  That is not good enough.  Government finance should not be labelled as being for an individual to use for his own purposes or those of his organisation.  This is new territory.  The Minister should take every step <Col N="300" /> with infinite care so that there will be no labels and no politicising and, most importantly, that the council will be seen to be independent, forward thinking and positive in the development of excellence in sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and that, after about 20 years of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, the sports council is finally being placed on a statutory basis. I also welcome the fact that it is not only given advisory functions but some executive functions as well.  That said, there are many functions which a Minister with political accountability and responsibility to the House should retain for himself and this is recognised in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There have been many developments arising from the changing attitudes to sport, consultation, research and the development of policy, since the council was first set up in 1971.  Given that the definition of sport is so broad, it is understandable why a statutory body is needed to undertake the functions outlined in the Bill.  The Council of Europe in its European Sports Charter, to which we are a party, states that &ldquo;sport means all forms of physical activity, which through casual or organised participation, aims at expression or improvement in physical fitness and mental wellbeing, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels&rdquo;. This seems to include all forms of sporting activity, be it leisure, recreation, performance or elite sport.</P>
      <P>These elements are recognised in the functions of the council.  It will have its work cut out for it. It will not be easy for it to carry out its functions given the attitude, difficulties and numbers involved in sport.  The first function of the council is to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in same.  Why does competitive sport have to be the first function of the council?  The second function is to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to co-ordinate their implementation by all bodies.  The third function is to facilitate, through the promulgation of guidelines and codes of practice, standards of good conduct and fair play in competitive sport.  This is welcome because, if there is not fair play in sport, where can one expect it?  The fourth function, which is particularly important, is to take such action as considered appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport.  The council must then initiate, encourage and facilitate research and disseminate information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its main aim should be to encourage participation at whatever level because that is the only way we will appreciate the value of sport.  Its value has been the wellbeing and the social and economic development of the country.  It should also incorporate the health and lifestyle of people, their social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  A sports strategy needs to bear all these in mind, but it also needs to have cognisance <Col N="301" /> of the changing demographic profile.  For some time it looked as if the population was static but it is now on the increase again.  The strategy also needs to examine sprawling suburban areas, especially in Dublin, where facilities may or may not be available.  Other areas it needs to bear in mind are: the services which need to be co-ordinated at local and national level; the fact that all Departments claim some responsibility for sport and its co-ordination; the protection which people involved need and the accountability for that &mdash; I welcomed the Minister's initiatives in this area earlier in the year; and funding, its sources &mdash; State, lottery or sponsorships &mdash; and its distribution.</P>
    <P>When discussing sport, we tend to talk about excellence and great achievers.  The real place to look is at the bottom and at young people and their involvement in sport.  Part of our culture and history is street games such as skipping, marbles, hopscotch and tig.  This is improved upon in primary schools.  The difficulty is that primary school teachers, of whom I am always in awe, must be experts in everything and are largely responsible for developing the co-ordination, mobility and strength of young students in their care.  Every primary school needs a qualified PE teacher and needs time allocated to PE.  The skills and talents needed by such teachers are becoming more demanding and extra attention needs to be given to PE in primary schools.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that the emphasis in second level schools is entirely on competitive sport. Especially in girls' schools, there is a problem of a lack of involvement.  The answer to this lies in transition year which is a gap year in which we can focus on the participation of young girls in recreational sports.  During my time as a transition year co-ordinator in Sion Hill in Blackrock, we ensured the programme involved in alternate cycles: sailing, bowling, soccer, modern dance and visits to Loughlinstown leisure centre.  We wanted to ensure the girls got a flavour of sport which would stand to them in later life, that they would become accustomed to dealing with and being in leisure centres, and that they knew that taking up a sport, such as sailing, would always be of benefit. The opportunity exists in transition year and the Minister, through his colleague in education, should ensure it is developed in all schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of sport as a subject on the leaving certificate.  It will obviously be based largely on performance.  However, it should also be examined to see if the facilities exist to assist students in reaching their potential.  Most schools must hire coaches to focus on a certain sport and more finance needs to be available for these people.</P>
    <P>In disadvantaged areas, especially in the drugs task force areas of which there is one in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, £20 million has been made available through a fund for those areas and £30 million through the Young People's Facilities Fund for capital and non-capital funding. This is the one way to encourage young <Col N="302" /> people to keep away from trouble, drugs and cider parties in parks.  The work done by organisations such as the Cabinteely GAA Club, the Ballybrack Boys Club and the Ballybrack Athletics Club in dealing with these people must be recognised.  The people organising these are all very dedicated and committed volunteers.  We laugh at advertisements on television which show women washing the team jerseys in the washing machine at home, but that is the reality.  Mothers throughout the country provide the kit and the gear each week.  A handful of men train groups every Saturday and on week nights.  They operate from containers and are dependent on the local council to ensure pitches are maintained in good condition.</P>
    <P>The role of parents needs to be encouraged.  If one were to visit Blackrock College in my constituency on a Saturday morning, one would find hundreds of parents supporting their children playing rugby but in other parts of the constituency there is not a parent to be seen.  Their presence would mean so much to the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend Gaisce on its work.  To qualify for a bronze, silver or gold medal one must engage in physical activity.  What is important, however, is that one can set one's own agenda and targets. There is no competition involved.  Once one reaches a particular goal an award is presented.</P>
    <P>The sense of achievement that a young person can get from participating in sport is nowhere more obvious than in the disabled who have to overcome many obstacles.  The Special Olympics Council is one of our greatest sporting organisations. I sincerely hope the Government is continuing to press to have the Special Olympics Games held here in 2003.  The needs of groups such as the Blackrock Flyers which meets every Saturday and the Physically Handicapped and Able-Bodied Club which allows physically handicapped and able-bodied people to learn from each other are great.  Teachers and coaches are nervous in dealing with disabled people.  There is, therefore, a need for special training.  There is also a need for accessible transport and special equipment.</P>
    <P>In the opening scene of Bless the Bride, a musical set in the last century in which I participated at school, the girls while playing croquet sing the lines:</P>
    <P>Croquet, croquet, gentle but gay</P>
    <P>Croquet brings the husbands our way.</P>
    <P>That was probably the attitude of women to sport 100 years ago.  I am happy to say the position has changed as a result of the achievements of Catherina McKiernan and Sonia O'Sullivan but problems remain.  Participation rates are lower among women than men.  There is a lack of child care facilities at sporting venues.  While the decision to show the all-Ireland ladies football final live is welcome, there is a lack of media coverage.  Fewer women are involved at organisational level.  There are fewer choices available to <Col N="303" /> women.  Some of these issues have been addressed by the National Women's Council which has made recommendations which I hope will be accepted.  It is not just the recreational aspect that is important but also the health aspect.  Women who play sport do not smoke and they are less likely to develop osteoporosis.  The Minister stated that there will be at least three women on the council.  I am sure he will not confine himself to that figure.</P>
    <P>My involvement in sport extends to running for the DART or for election.  I empathise with the more sedentary types, including the thousands of people who gather each week to play bridge and who are seeking to have it recognised as a sport. Chess for young people falls into the same category. They are leisure activities and should be recognised as sport.</P>
    <P>The value of our native games continues to be highlighted.  As someone who was born and reared in Thurles, I have a natural interest in the GAA and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that one of the strongest clubs in Dublin &mdash; Cuala &mdash; is in my constituency.  It fields 40 teams every Saturday and deserves our support.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom díriú ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le cluichí agus spórt sa Ghaeltacht agus mar a bhaineann siad leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, an-tábhachtach don Ghaeltacht mar tarrangaíonn sé Gaeltachtaí le chéile atá scartha amach óna chéile, idir Conamara, Ciarraí agus Dún na nGall.</P>
    <P>Smaoiním freisin ar eagraíochtaí ar nós Gael-Linn a eagraíonn spórt do dhaoine le Gaeilge, do na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge agus do na Gaeltachtaí agus a thógann le chéile iad chun spraoi agus sult a bhaint as na cluichí seo.</P>
    <P>Sa chathair seo bíonn a lán cúrsaí Gaeilge ar siúl i rith an tsamhraidh, ceann amháin acu, mar shampla, Brú Éanna a reachtaítear i gColáiste na Carraige Duibhe.  Tá sin bunaithe ar spórt agus ar chluichí.  Feicim go bhfuil an-chuid daoine óga ag iarraidh dul chuig na cúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht, cúrsaí a chuireann béim ar spórt mar an príomh rud agus gur féidir an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid tríd an spórt.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh, mar sin, ag dul do na cúrsaí sin mar tá siad ag freastal ar an teanga agus ar an spórt.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the carding system for our elite athletes.  I also congratulate Catherina McKiernan on her great achievements.  It would be remiss of me, however, not to express my sorrow at the loss of Noel Carroll who made an enormous contribution to Irish sport.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <P>It is important that we preserve our good name through the carding system and the dope testing scheme.  Others have addressed the tourism and economic aspects which extend to angling, golf, leisure weekends and sailing.  We have attracted the Ryder Cup and other events such as the Smurfit European Open.  A report compiled four years ago indicated that the industry accounted <Col N="304" /> for more than 18,500 jobs.  I have no doubt a more up-to-date report would show that the figure is far higher.  In allocating sums of £50,000 and £100,000 the Minister should not forget to allocate smaller amounts to smaller groups which can do so much with so little.</P>
    <P>In a new era of peace there is scope for greater co-operation between North and South.  When one looks at our rugby team and the sporting links which have been forged between Shankill in Dublin and Shankill in Belfast one can appreciate the opportunities open to young people to create a better understanding between communities, North and South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overriding priority of the Government continues to be the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects and to try to ensure that the various time scales set out in the Agreement are fully respected.  We are working closely with the British Government and with the political parties in Northern Ireland to achieve this.  Confidence in the Agreement can only be <Col N="305" /> sustained by real progress in the implementation process.  The Agreement is about ushering in a new era of peace, partnership, and co-operation on this island.  The appalling murder last weekend of Brian Service and the tragedy it represents for his family provides a stark reminder to us all of the bitter past we are trying to leave behind and just how important it is that we implement the Agreement in its totality.</P>
    <P>We have already made considerable progress in the implementation process with the two successful referendums and the elections to and the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Patten Commission has begun its work on police reform and a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland is also under way.  The International Decommissioning Commission is working actively with parties to bring about decommissioning as mandated in the Agreement.  Both Governments will continue to work closely together to ensure the full and speedy implementation of all aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The British Parliament is considering the Northern Ireland Bill which combines provisions on constitutional matters, detailed arrangements for the transfer of power to the Assembly and the enabling provisions in respect of the other institutions. The Bill has already passed the House of Commons and is now with the House of Lords. It is expected to be given Royal assent later this month.</P>
    <P>For our part, the overview function with regard to the implementation of the Agreement rests with the interdepartmental steering committee, chaired by my Department.  A subcommittee is taking forward implementation of the North-South aspects of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Legislation will be required in both jurisdictions in respect of the establishment of the North-South implementation bodies.  Other legislative measures regarding the release of prisoners, establishment of a human rights commission, changes to the Irish nationality and citizenship acts, employment equality and equal status are dealt with by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who informed the House on 20 October of progress being made on these and other matters.</P>
    <P>All of us are conscious of the difficulty we are facing on the issue of decommissioning which has stalled the establishment of the shadow executive and other shadow institutions.  Whatever the merits of the arguments on both sides, the solution to this current impasse lies in building up trust on both sides.  Both Governments are working on ways in which this can be achieved.  We have to build the necessary confidence on both sides to allow us to press on with the implementation of the Agreement.  We are both agreed we cannot allow one issue to block progress in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning was an essential part of the negotiations and a key element of the British Irish Agreement.  Like all aspects of the Agreement <Col N="306" /> it must be implemented in full.  Under the Agreement all parties were asked to work constructively with the independent commission and to confirm their intention to &ldquo;use any influence they may have to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years&rdquo;.  The appointment in September of Martin McGuinness as the Sinn Féin representative to work with the decommissioning commission was a positive indication by that party that it intends to co-operate fully on this issue.</P>
    <P>The key to the delivery of decommissioning lies in the Agreement.  There are specific mechanisms and a specific framework set out for handling the issue.  The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, chaired by General de Chastelain, has a critical role to play in the resolution of the issue.  General de Chastelain is working hard with all the relevant parties to resolve this issue and has the full support of both Governments.  I also welcome the direct dialogue between David Trimble and Gerry Adams, which could be central to building trust.  Building trust is the key to the solution of our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>It would have been preferable if difficulties on one area had not meant that we missed the deadline of 31 October in another araea.  Under the Agreement it was planned that the shadow North-South Ministerial Council would identify and agree by that date at least six subject areas in which implementation bodies are to be established and six others where co-operation would be on the basis of existing arrangements.  Substantial informal preparatory work has been done in a variety of formats at both political and official level.  Earlier this week in Belfast the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and I had a very constructive meeting with the Northern Ireland parties to advance the work of identification and agreement on the North-South bodies.  A reasonable degree of convergence has emerged and there is evidence of potential common ground.  We hope we can agree the North-South bodies quickly so that we can begin soon the legislative and other preparations necessary to establish them.</P>
    <P>Nobody is seeking to minimise the size of the challenge we face in completing the implementation of the Agreement but let us be clear about one reality: there is no other option available. The Agreement is the will of the people and all of us in political leadership are required to ensure that the will of the people is delivered.  I am certain that, building on the very real progress that has been made since Good Friday, we can complete the task.  In doing so, we will ensure that the potential of the Agreement for a dynamic new era in this island can be realised.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that in his reply on 28 May last he set out a timetable which said that in early July the Assembly was due to begin meeting in shadow form to elect a presiding officer and shadow first minister.  This has been achieved.  The timetable said that in September there would be inaugural meetings of <Col N="307" /> the shadow North-South Ministerial Council and the shadow British Irish Council.  The deadline for the agreement of the shadow North-South Ministerial Council on at least six areas in which implementation bodies are to be established is 31 October and at the end of 1998 and early in 1999 the two Governments are to enact legislation and take the other steps necessary to establish implementation bodies.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out a timetable in precise terms on 28 May.  Does he agree that the timetable has now been derailed?  If decommissioning is to be achieved within two years then we must presume it will start at some stage within that two year period.  Does the Minister agree that if there is not a start to decommissioning soon the First Minister designate will himself be derailed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says. I set out what I considered to be a prospective timetable in the circumstances at that time.  In the meantime, as the Deputy has pointed out, circumstances have changed and there is a decommissioning blockage.  The Deputy will appreciate that these circumstances are extremely sensitive. We are trying to build bridges between opposing and firmly held positions.  It is my and the Taoiseach's belief that this can be done privately and must be done with patience.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at some of the public rhetoric in Northern Ireland in recent times.  All sides need to calm the situation and to work with renewed determination to move matters forward. This is what the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and I tried to do on Monday last, I believe with some significant success.  We must be very measured in what we say and pay well merited tribute to all sides for their sensitivity.</P>
      <P>On the central point of the Deputy's question that there is now a new timetable, it is difficult to be precise about the timetable for the period ahead.  I can offer what might be considered the best thinking on it.  I hope the sequence of upcoming events I will now give will happen sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>With regard to agreement on the demarcation of up to ten Northern Ireland departments I believe that work is going ahead on the six plus six, that is six areas in which implementation bodies are to be established and six where co-operation will be given through existing machinery.  I pay tribute to our Civil Service in this regard.  I brought a paper to Government two weeks ago and the House would be proud of its readiness to put into operation immediately the machinery required in the context of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Governments will initiate the necessary legislative and other preparations for the establishment of the implementation bodies.  This is likely to take two to three months.  In November 1998 the Northern Ireland Bill will get Royal assent.  Early in the New Year the Government will complete the necessary legislative and other preparations for the establishment of the <Col N="308" /> implementation bodies and the North-South Ministerial Council.  In February 1999 the two Governments will exchange letters notifying each other that all necessary legislation has been enacted.  The Agreement will come into force; the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will be firmly established; full powers will be devolved to the Assembly and the Government will make a declaration triggering the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I attended Mass in Mount Argus last Sunday and I heard the priest, Fr. Fernandez, who is a friend of the late Mr. Brian Service's father, preach about the family.  Anyone who heard that sermon was struck by the essence of the problem which will continue for as long as weapons are in the hands of terrorists in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister convinced Sinn Féin and the IRA, in particular, will start to decommission in the near future so that the process and timetable can get under way?</P>

      <P>I express my condolences to the Service family.  This enormous tragedy should not have happened.  It is the will of all politicians, North and South, to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to the substantive part of the Deputy's question, the solution to the current impasse lies in the building of trust on both sides. Unionism does not trust the IRA's intentions as regards decommissioning, Sinn Féin sees the failure to agree the establishment of the shadow executive as evidence of bad faith on Mr. Trimble's part and both Governments, in our discussions with the two sides, have explored ways in which confidence can be built which would allow them both to feel comfortable with the result.  As these discussions are still ongoing, it would not be helpful to go into too much detail.</P>

Now that the timetable has slipped, although I acknowledge the efforts the Minister, the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the British Government have made to stay with the timetable, is there a new schedule or are there new target dates?  How optimistic is he that we can overcome the present impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remain optimistic and hopeful.  The Deputy was not here when I went through the likely sequence of events.  I set out what might be considered target dates for the demarcation of up to ten Northern Ireland departments.  It will probably take two to three months for the Governments to initiate the necessary legislative and other preparations for the establishment of the implementation bodies.  The Northern Ireland Bill will get Royal assent some time this month.  Early in the New Year the Governments will complete the necessary legislative <Col N="309" /> and other preparations for the establishment of the implementation bodies and the North-South Ministerial Council.  In February 1999 the Governments will exchange letters notifying each other that all necessary legislation has been enacted.  These may be nothing more than happy thoughts, but they are our best guesstimate of the target dates the Deputy requested.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the discussion at the meeting of heads of state and Government at Poertschach was wide-ranging and informal and, as such, no conclusions were expected or reached at the meeting.  The meeting was attended by the Taoiseach and other heads of state and Government and for part of the discussion by Austrian Foreign Minister Schuessel. A number of ideas relating to the better co-ordination of EU policy were discussed at the meeting. I understand the Taoiseach indicated that in any examination of the role of the Council of Ministers, Ireland would be concerned that the central link between the General Affairs Council and the European Council should be maintained and that reforms should be oriented towards making this link more direct, dynamic and efficient.</P>

      <P>Having been in that predicament myself as a down the line sub-editor in the <i>Irish Press</i> many years ago, I was given all sorts of instructions to fit almost the unprintable into a headline.  There is no truth in the rumour.  No such consideration was on the agenda in the discussions which took place on the improvements which might be possible in terms of the functioning of the General Affairs Council.  There was a wide measure of agreement at Poertschach that co-ordination at national level should be left to each individual member state to organise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Austrian Presidency got agreement at <Col N="310" /> Salzburg on a package of efficiency improving measures which it is likely to develop and present in a report to Vienna.  These measures included streamlining third country contacts, shorter lunches, separation of points for decision from information items and greater use of video conferencing. These adjustments seem unlikely to take the place of what appears to be a developing measure of agreement to separate the agenda and allow member states to decide themselves which Minister attends in relation to horizontal or external issues.  The agenda has now been divided into horizontal and external matters.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recollect that there was an attempt by the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister for European Affairs when he came to Government? We are unique in terms of European Union states in that we do not have a Minister for European Affairs to work with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is too difficult for the Minister to handle his workload because of the places he must be at any one time.  Does the Minister agree that, if the Tánaiste does not take on a co-ordinating role at European level, he should have a Minister for European Affairs to assist him in his heavy workload?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps, if any, Ireland will take as part of a process of strengthening EU-North American relations.  [22192/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We view the European Union's relations with Canada and the United States as extremely important.  For that reason, successive Governments have made the strengthening of these relationships a priority during Irish Presidencies of the EU.  Ireland will continue to work to strengthen these relationships by our participation in political dialogue with the US and Canada and in the EU bodies charged with the conduct of the relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU-US political and economic relations are conducted within the framework of the Joint <Col N="311" /> Action Plan and the New Transatlantic Agenda, adopted at the EU-US Summit in Madrid on 3 December 1995.  The Joint Action Plan provides a framework for co-operation between the two sides in promoting peace and stability, democracy and development; responding to global challenges; contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations and building bridges across the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Political dialogue between the European Union and the United States takes the form of biannual meetings at Foreign Minister level. These meetings are supplemented by regular meetings of officials.  An EU-US senior level group, comprising representatives of the Presidency, the European Commission and the US, monitors and reports to EU-US summit meetings, held every six months, on the priorities for cooperation identified in the Joint Action Plan.  The most recent summit took place in London on 18 May 1998.  The New Transatlantic Agenda is a political statement which aims to heighten public awareness of the continuing importance of the transatlantic relationship for international peace and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The London Summit decided to establish a Transatlantic Economic Partnership, TEP.  This important initiative aims to accelerate economic growth, mainly by reducing regulatory and other non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services between the EU and US.  The partnership stipulates that the US and EU should work together to achieve substantial further trade liberalisation on a multilateral basis within the context of the World Trade Organisation negotiations.  The partnership covers the important areas of manufactured products, agriculture, services, industrial customs duties, global electronic trade, intellectual property rights, investments, public procurement and competition.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between the Office of the US Trade Representative, USTR, and the EU Commission have continued since May on the elaboration of a TEP Joint Action Plan.  Ireland is playing an active and constructive role in the co-ordination of the European position in these negotiations.  I hope agreement can be achieved on this latest package of proposals at an early meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers Council. The way would then be clear for adoption of the action plan at the EU-US Summit in Washington on 15 December next.  Elements of the TEP will then be implemented at intervals during 1999 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The framework for EU-Canada relations is provided by the Joint Declaration and Action Plan, signed in Ottawa on 17 December 1996. This covers trade relations, including the objective of further reducing or eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers and the resolution of outstanding bilateral trade disputes; foreign policy and security issues; transnational issues &mdash; environment, health, migration, terrorism, organised crime and misuse of the information highway; and <Col N="312" /> the fostering of education, technology, business and science links.  The action plan also provides for closer co-ordination between the EU and Canada in the OSCE.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the next EU-Canada Summit, to be held in Ottawa on 14 December, are in hand.  Ireland is fully engaged in the preparatory discussions on the EU side and is favourably disposed towards any further measures which would enhance the increasing trade and political links between the EU and Canada.  I am satisfied the actions and initiatives I have outlined demonstrate clearly that substantial progress continues to be made in strengthening the vital relationships that exist between the EU and North America.</P>

Has the Minister had the opportunity to read the document I sent him outlining a proposal for the creation of a transatlantic foundation for EU-North American co-operation which would be located here, given our credentials and the experience we have of Canadian and US relations and as an English speaking EU state.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership for Peace has been in existence since January 1994.  The previous Government published a White Paper on Foreign Policy in 1996, which devoted a chapter to the new developments in European security and indicated that the benefits for Ireland of participation in PfP would be explored, and foresaw Irish participation in PfP.  However, notwithstanding the approach set out in the White Paper, it seems that the previous Government deferred a decision on the issue of Irish participation in PfP.  I also openly acknowledge that my party took a clear position on this matter prior to the last general election. <Col N="313" /> When I became Minister, I reviewed the question of Ireland's participation in PfP.  It was clear to me that there were sincerely held divided opinions on the matter in this House and among sections of the wider community.  I therefore concluded that my two-fold priority should be, first, to enhance understanding and informed discussion of the realities of PfP and, second, in consequence, to move discussion away from the polarised views and slogans which seemed to me to characterise a good deal of such discussion as there was about PfP, on either side of the argument.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I welcomed in this House the initiative earlier this year of Deputy O'Malley, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to devote attention to new developments in European security, including Ireland's possible participation in PfP.  Deputy O'Malley, with other Deputies, including Deputies Gay Mitchell and Spring, has presided over several particularly informative and constructive sessions of the committee and that these have enhanced understanding of the issues within this House.  All other European neutral countries, including Switzerland, are now members of Partnership for Peace, which is simply a flexible form of bilateral co-operation with the organisation that other European countries have recognised as having the principal role to play in keeping peace on the continent both now and in the future &mdash; that is, NATO.</P>
      <P>I regard such debate and information gathering as both healthy and a necessary element in considering the issue of Ireland's participation in PfP.</P>
      <P>Papers on PfP and on developments on European security more generally are being and have been prepared in the Department of Foreign Affairs, at my request.  I have briefed the Government on the issue, with particular reference to the fact that Partnership for Peace has developed since 1994, but more particularly over the last year, into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN-mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management. I am keeping the issue of Irish participation in PfP under close and active review and welcome the ongoing public debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the warming of the Minister to this issue.  He is a great deal more enthusiastic than he has been in the past.  I detect a great change in his attitude to this matter.  Perhaps this is because when another Deputy was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on foreign affairs, the parliamentary party was not consulted and it was handed the document when it was printed. This is the petard on which our foreign policy has been hoisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the White Paper on Foreign Policy stated that the overall objectives of Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security and participation could have several important <Col N="314" /> advantages, which it then lists?  Is he aware that the Secretary General of his Department, speaking at the foreign affairs committee last week said that it is obviously an advantage to be in Partnership for Peace and that it was peculiar for us to be outside it and the Defence Forces wished to have this advantage.  The Secretary General clearly stated there were many reasons we should be in Partnership for Peace and few reasons we should not be.  It may be that hell hath no fury like a Secretary General scorned, but Mr. McKernan has been much more forthcoming than the Minister.  How can he say this matter is under examination when the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 20 October that the Government was examining the initiatives neutral countries might take collectively but was not thinking of Partnership for Peace?  That conflicts with what the Minister has just told the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, because at that time the Taoiseach would have been correct but since then the position has moved on, in the sense that I am seeking a debate, both inside and outside the House, on Partnership for Peace.  That does not intrude on our neutrality, nor does it imply we will become members of the NATO military alliance.  In his appearance before the committee the Secretary General of my Department endeavoured to respond as fully as possible to questions put to him by Members and in doing so he made clear he was not prejudging decisions which must be made at political level.  He also underlined that the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to advise the Government and the Minister regarding the options for and conduct of foreign policy, not to make political judgments as such.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves.  Partnership for Peace has existed since January 1994, almost five years, while this Government has been in office for less than a year and a half.  The previous Government published a White Paper on foreign policy in 1996, which foresaw Irish participation in Partnership for Peace, as I said.  It is curious that, notwithstanding the approach set out in the White Paper, the previous Government deferred the issue of Irish participation in Partnership for Peace.  I have been Minister for Foreign Affairs for little over a year, I am now seeking a balanced and informed debate on the area, and I hope the Deputy will join me in this endeavour rather than dwelling on what did or did not happen in the past.  It is my intention to consult broadly with organisations with an interest in this issue, such as NGOs, and within my party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation for official development assistance, or ODA, has increased year on year since 1992 from a base of £40 million to £137 million, an increase of 242.5 per cent.  Whereas in 1992 our level of aid relative to GNP was by far the smallest of any donor country, we are now in 12th <Col N="316" /> position in a list of 21 donor countries.  By any standard this is a remarkable growth rate, with few parallels in other expenditure areas.  It reflects the Government's continuing commitment to increasing ODA and its intention to play a role, concomitant with our status as a developed nation, in combating poverty in the developing world and in reflecting the innate generosity to the Third World of the Irish public.</P>
    <P>In the period from 1992 to 1997, the aid allocation as a percentage of GNP rose from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent, in line with the commitment to move towards the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP.  However, a handicap in maintaining this progress has been the extraordinary growth in GNP.  For example, despite a further increase of £15 million in 1998, aimed, when allocated, at reaching a target of 0.32 per cent of GNP, the rapid GNP growth in the year has meant the out-turn is more likely to be around 0.29 per cent. But that should not obscure the fact that growth in financial terms has been real and substantial.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting and would never accept that there are any grounds for complacency.  I have stated in plain language that our present level of aid is unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  In a recent speech, I indicated that the level of Irish aid is low relative to the leading countries, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, all of whom exceed the UN target of 0.7 per cent; is well behind the average for EU countries, which is 0.37 per cent; and is still one of the smallest in absolute terms &mdash; only Luxembourg and New Zealand have smaller programmes. I also accept it will be extremely difficult to maintain growth in GNP terms at a time of exceptional GNP expansion.  Even in financial terms, it will be difficult to maintain growth in a situation in which there are very good reasons for restraint of public expenditure and there are competing demands in relation to genuinely compelling domestic priorities.  The purpose of my speech was to contribute to a debate in our democracy about where our priorities ought to lie.  The establishment of priorities among competing demands &mdash; all of them legitimate &mdash; is the proper business of this House and political institutions.</P>
    <P>As to the place of development aid among spending priorities, I have made my own position crystal clear.  I believe the proportion of public expenditure going on development aid, currently about 1 per cent, should be increased further. Notwithstanding the perfectly valid arguments for restraining public expenditure and the compelling arguments for increased expenditure in some areas, I have argued that there are five good reasons we should increase aid expenditure: first, because it is the right thing to do; second, because aid produces good results in terms of reducing poverty; third, because we have benefited enormously from the generosity of others, including the EU; fourth, because it is in our own long-term interests; and fifth, because for the first time in our history we can afford to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree the ODA percentage contribution is likely to fall to 0.28 per cent of GNP in 1999?  Given that Government policy is that the percentage should rise to 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002, does she intend to pursue her threat, made on RTE's &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; today, to resign if the Government does not meet her demand for an increase in this year's budget?  What did she mean by saying the Government has a window of opportunity between now and budget day to make good her demands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact that because of unprecedented levels of growth, my allocation of £137 million this year to ODA will fall below the GNP level we expected to reach. All reliable analysis expected it to be 0.32 per cent of GNP but because of exceptional growth it will be only 0.29 or 0.30 per cent.  This issue must be discussed because it has a significant impact on the overall targets we set in 1996 to which this Government is committed.  In many ways we are victims of our own economic success but it raises the spectre of us failing to reach our projected target.</P>
      <P>In financial terms I expect there will be a significant increase in my ODA budget for 1999. The Estimates have not been published yet so I cannot go into any details but I imagine that, because of continuing growth, there is a danger of slippage in our aid budget as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge, as the Minister of State has done, the increases we made between 1992 and 1997.  That was not always easy due to competing demands but we managed it because of the commitment made in the programme for Government.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government states that there will be increases in compliance with our commitment to the United Nations?  Will she clarify if the Estimate for overseas development aid for the next year has been agreed by the Cabinet? I understand the Minister of State made a remark on radio at lunch-time today that if there was not a <i>pro rata</i> increase along the lines of our commitments to the UN, she would resign from her position.  Will she clarify that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government intends to maintain our commitment to reach the percentage increase as indicated in the programme for Government.  In other words, during the lifetime of this Government we will reach the 0.45 per cent figure but it is difficult to do that when it is tied to a fast growing GNP.  I hope that over the lifetime of this Government we will continue on that logical trajectory towards that target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my comments today, I said I have made my position on this matter very clear.  I am not happy that the level of increase agreed by the Cabinet during the Estimates discussion is satisfactory <Col N="318" /> in terms of our overall commitment to the poor of the Third World and our European and international commitments to reach the targets to which I am committed.  There is a window of opportunity between now and budget day for the Cabinet to review its position on this matter and respond to the genuine advocacy of the social partners today when they reminded the Government of our international and domestic commitments made in the programme for Government not to turn our backs on the poorest people of the world at a time of unprecedented economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree there are approximately 3,000 million people throughout the world whose income is less than £3 per day, that the small contribution from Ireland is important from a moral point of view in terms of our role in international fora, and that it would send the wrong signal if we joined the countries outside of those the Minister of State has named and slid back in terms of our contribution to the poor of the world?  It is essential that either the Estimates or the budget deliver on the commitment this and previous Governments have made to aim for the target of 0.45 per cent by 2002 and the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a manifestation of our commitment to civilised values that we maintain our commitment to the Third World.  That commitment has strong democratic support in Ireland.  Irish people in their personal contributions are very generous to Third World charities and we have an excellent reputation both here and abroad, particularly in Africa where we operate long-term development projects with our partner countries.  This is a moral issue and it is a litmus test of our commitment to the vindication of human rights in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Minister of State follows through on her threat to resign will be a litmus test of her sincerity.  I note in her replies to Deputy Spring and myself that she did not deny she said she will resign if these percentage targets are not met.  Will the Minister of State agree that the commitments made by Ireland to meet 0.45 per cent of GNP contributions by 2002 are modest not just in terms of the UN target of 0.7 per cent but in terms of some of our EU partners, in particular the Nordic countries which have already exceeded the UN target figure?  Will she agree also that the important figure is not the amount of contribution but the percentage GNP contribution, given that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development contribution fell from £55.4 billion in 1996 to £47.6 billion in 1997, a decline of 14.2 per cent?  Unless we strive to achieve the 0.7 per cent target figure, and not the modest figure of 0.45 per cent, we cannot ask other OECD countries to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="319" />
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 0.45 per cent is a modest target.  The EU average is 0.37 per cent of GNP and we continue to be short of that figure. The percentage of GNP will be difficult in light of the rapid growth in our economy but it is an internationally recognised measure to which we are committed.  All the developed countries of the world have signed up to this aspiration and Ireland must hold true to this and aim towards achieving that target of 0.7 per cent.  The difficulty, however, is that our growth has overtaken the targets set at the beginning of this year and in 1996.</P>
      <P>I run my budget not on the basis of percentages of GNP but in cash terms and there has been a steady 10 per cent growth each year.  I got £15 million this year and I hope to get a further increase which will mean we will still be on target in financial terms, but I am not happy there is slippage on the UN target and the target we set for ourselves in the programme for Government. I have made my position clear.  I cannot do any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reiteration of the Government's overall commitment even though it will reduce the interim figure of 0.45 per cent.  The figures are modest in their own right.  I find it difficult to accept the Minister's statement that we are victims of our own economic success.  From the figures released earlier this week, we are talking about a surplus of over £1.1 billion.  This is a litmus test of the conviction of this Government.  We were successful between 1992 and 1997 and I hope she will do what she said on the news today and convince her party colleagues in the first instance and her Government colleagues to maintain our commitment to the poor of the world.</P>
      <P>I detect a little inconsistency in the Minister's statement that the Government will reach its interim figure over the lifetime of the Government. If we do not maintain the figure this year there is no possibility of achieving it in the lifetime of the Government.  This year is the test and the Minister should ensure the money is provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply the Minister of State indicated that economic growth was a handicap in reaching the targets set.  Will she explain how economic growth and the buoyancy in tax income we currently enjoy is a handicap in providing relatively small amounts of money in the ODA budget?  Does the handicap to which she referred relate to the criteria on spending with which we are obliged to comply by the European Union?  If it does, would she consider it worthwhile to have expenditure by European Union states on ODA excluded from this calculation of Government expenditure &mdash; this generally means expenditure within the State which ODA is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I have made a number of suggestions in respect of <Col N="320" /> this matter.  I understand the Minister for Finance's difficulty in trying to maintain the ceiling of 4 per cent on current expenditure. However, since the entire ODA budget goes out of the country it does not have the effect of overheating the economy as do other elements of current expenditure.  There has been a great deal of debate between my Department and the Department of Finance on this matter.</P>
      <P>The economic handicap to which the Deputy referred arises if we take GNP, which is variable, as the bottom line against which progress is measured in terms of ODA.  There is nothing I can do about that.  At the beginning of the year, my Department's sole budgetary responsibility lay with £137 million allocated in the 1998 budget and on the basis of the best estimate of the economic indicators we predicted that this figure would represent an increase over last year in terms of GNP.  The figure for last year was 0.31 per cent of GNP, 1998 was meant to be 0.32 per cent but, because of the huge growth in the economy, the figure is sliding backwards.</P>
      <P>There is room for intellectual investment and economic thought about how we could remove ODA from the general constraints on current expenditure because it does not overheat the economy and the benefits from it go outside the country.  These benefits are responsible for facilitating great work in developing countries. Those of us who saw the &ldquo;visions of hell&rdquo; witnessed by the Minister and myself during recent visits to Sudan or who heard the horror stories emanating from Honduras, are absolutely convinced that we must honour our commitment to the UN and meet our OECD targets. The challenge we now face is to convince others &mdash; I am glad the social partners support us in this &mdash; that we have a moral commitment to do just that.</P>

      <P>It is all about the winning numbers.</P>
      <P>I have reported to the House on a number of occasions on developments in Kosovo, most recently in my statement on 15 October.  I outlined then the objectives of the international community which are: to bring an end to hostilities, with a withdrawal of Serb forces and a lasting ceasefire; to get talks aimed at a political solution under way; and to provide urgently required humanitarian assistance to the displaced and in particular shelterless Albanian population. Clearly these objectives are interlinked.  The humanitarian crisis can only be addressed adequately when the ceasefire is secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> At the time of my statement the agreement between American Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic had just been reached.  The terms of that agreement were focused on securing immediate compliance with Security Council Resolutions 1160 and 1199.  In addition, however, the agreement spelt out a series of measures to restore normality to Kosovo through political measures, the holding of elections and the restoration of and respect for the human rights of all citizens of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The parties must now urgently start negotiations on a political solution and the future status of Kosovo.  President Milosevic must stand by his agreement with Ambassador Holbrooke, and the Kosovo Albanian leadership must engage in serious dialogue without preconditions and with the widest possible representation in its negotiating team.  For its part the EU will remain actively involved in supporting the negotiating process, notably through the activity of its special envoy.  These points were emphasised by the General Affairs Council at its meeting on 26 October.</P>
    <P>The Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement and the Security Council resolutions demand that the parties to the conflict assume their responsibility to carry out all the demands made of them by the international community.  A key element has also been entrusted to the OSCE, which has been asked to establish a large verification mission on the ground in Kosovo.  The initial step to establish this mission was taken on 16 October through the signing in Belgrade of an agreement by the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE and the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Another agreement providing for the establishment of an air verification mission over Kosovo, complementing the OSCE verification mission on the ground, was signed by the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and the Yugoslav Chief of General Staff in Belgrade on 15 October.  Subsequent to this, the United Nations Security Council on 24 September, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, adopted a further Resolution, No. 1203, which calls on the parties to ensure that the personnel of the Kosovo verification mission are not subject to the threat or use of force or interference of any kind.  Resolution 1203 affirms that, in the event of an emergency, action may be needed to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of verification mission personnel.</P>
    <P>The OSCE in Vienna is now urgently addressing the arrangements which need to be put in place to establish the Kosovo verification mission. For the OSCE this is an undertaking of unprecedented size and complexity.  The issues which it is addressing range from finance to structure, organisation and the nature of personnel requirements. The OSCE has established a special planning unit to address these issues and Irish personnel are contributing to the work of this unit.</P>
    <P>We have indicated to our EU partners and to the OSCE our readiness in principle to contribute <Col N="323" /> to the verification mission.  The precise size and composition of our contribution will depend on the needs of the mission, which are currently being identified by the OSCE, in addition to the availability of resources.  It is likely at this stage that the OSCE may adopt a phased approach to the build-up of the mission, and, if that is the case, our approach would be similar.  I expect that the priority requirement in the first instance would be military expertise.  As protection of human rights and democratisation are key components of the mission's overall task, these aspects also need to be intensively addressed at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Security of personnel in the Kosovo verification mission is a matter of paramount concern. This is also the view of my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Council.  I assure the House that I and my colleagues in Government will take this aspect fully into account when we come to make decisions about Irish participation.  As part of our planning process, I have instructed Ireland's Ambassador to the OSCE to travel as soon as possible to Kosovo as head of an Irish technical mission to establish at first-hand the requirements, conditions and safety aspects involved. Pending the establishment of the verification mission, monitoring is continuing through the Kosovo diplomatic observer mission and the European Union monitoring mission.  In due course the former will be absorbed into the verification mission while the latter will maintain its separate identity.  Ireland will have a presence in the European Union monitoring mission and is providing extra resources to replace personnel diverted into Kosovo from elsewhere in the region.</P>
    <P>The agreement between Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic came about only as a result of the exercise of maximum pressure by NATO on Belgrade.  While the question of air strikes by NATO was a matter for that organisation, EU Ministers were conscious of the role that a credible threat could play in reaching the recent agreement.  As I made clear to the House in my statement on 15 October, I regretted that it was only the threat of force rather than the power of dialogue which finally brought about the agreement.  Since then, Resolution 1203 welcomed the signing of the agreement on an air verification mission over Kosovo by NATO and FRY.  The General Affairs Council of 26 October expressed its support for the air verification mission and said it would welcome the participation of Russia and other non-NATO countries in it.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian dimension remains the single most immediate priority in Kosovo.  For that reason it was also central to our discussions at the EU Council.  The EU Presidency has prepared an action plan for the return of refugees and displaced persons which pays particular attention to the needs of those most in need of assistance against the onset of winter.  Ireland has already allocated £200,000 for humanitarian assistance: <Col N="324" /> £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for refugees in Albania and £150,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its relief effort in Kosovo, which will be spent on food, clothing shelter and health care for the most vulnerable.  The Government will consider further assistance as more information on needs emerges.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, through the European Community Humanitarian Office, has announced aid totalling 18.5 million ecu.  Overall humanitarian assistance of the EC and its member states for 1998 will total about 44 million ecu. I assure the House of the Government's determination to do everything possible to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and to bring about a just settlement.  I will continue to keep the House informed of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister shares the abhorrence of the House in regard to what has happened in Kosovo.  In relation to his instruction to our ambassador to the OSCE to report back to him on the safety of operations in Kosovo, will the Minister ask either this ambassador or another relevant person to examine the humanitarian needs in the area to ensure our contribution is generous, given the suffering people there have endured?  If the tyrant Mr. Milosevic does not keep to the agreement, will the Minister agree NATO does not require any further UN authorisation given that it has authorisation to carry out strikes against Belgrade?  If that happens will the Irish Government support such strikes in terms of logistics, fly-over facilities, landing or refuelling arrangements or in any other way that may be necessary?</P>

      <P>So far as the mission is concerned, the so-called technical mission I am sending under the leadership of our ambassador, Mr. Brendan McMahon, the humanitarian needs will be given top priority.  The savagery with which the people there were treated is beyond belief.  It is difficult to perceive the type of treatment meted out to them.  For that reason, I welcome the Deputy's remarks.</P>
      <P>On the question of additional cash assistance, the Government will examine the possibility of adding to our contribution, in addition to whatever other moneys may be available from ECHO &mdash; the humanitarian arm of the European Union &mdash; which has made a substantial contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of strikes and the necessity of a further resolution, we have come to the end of resolutions at the United Nations.  My information is that that is where the buck stops.  It is a matter for President Milosevic to proceed with his undertakings with Ambassador Holbrooke and we will support the UN resolution.  It is interesting to note, as a matter of information, what might be seen as a prospective shift in German policy to where we stand.  The penultimate paragraph of an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> of 4 November 1998, contributed by Mr. <Col N="325" /> William Drozdiak of the <i>Washington Post Service</i> states:</P>
    <P>In addition, although Germany joined other NATO states in approving air strikes against Yugoslavia, unless it halted its military action against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, senior German officials said any new crisis would require a reappraisal of whether such attacks could be launched without the explicit approval of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Social Democrats and the Greens have long supported ambitious disarmament proposals that may cause friction with the United States.  As NATO embarks on a major strategy review, many critics of nuclear weapons expect the new German government to argue for pledges of &ldquo;no first use&rdquo; of nuclear weapons and other initiatives to wean the alliance from its dependence on those weapons as a strategic deterrent.</P>
    <P>On the initiative I have adopted in relation to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we may well have a strong ally in the new government in Germany.</P>

      <P>I support any contribution the Government may make to alleviate the humanitarian disaster which has been wrought on the people of Kosovo.  Is the Minister confident the international mission will bring about a situation in Kosovo whereby refugees can return home with their safety guaranteed, given the disasters and the brutal murders that have taken place in the past 12 months?  Is he confident the international community can establish conditions whereby the refugees will have protection from the threat of Mr. Milosevic and his troops?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question which deserves a serious answer.  So far as the safety of returning refugees is concerned, I understand, subject to clarification, a large majority have returned to their homeplaces and that in many instances their villages have been destroyed, some beyond recognition.  It is a terrible disaster. On the question of monitoring the mission, I have already set out the position &mdash; the European Community Monitoring Mission will support the verification mission when it becomes a reality. The OSCE is handling this complex problem with the view to getting the verification mission on the ground as a matter of urgency.  As Deputy Gay Mitchell has said, Mr. Milosevic is a wretched leader who seems to have no concern for his own people, least of all the majority Albanians in Kosovo who make up 80 per cent of the population. To return to Deputy Spring's question, we must keep a close and critical eye on the movements and actions of this individual who presides over the problems of the semi-autonomous area of Kosovo.  For that reason we will ensure we contribute increasing amounts of financial assistance and continue to articulate the concerns of many organisations here who have put forward their <Col N="326" /> views and concerns in relation to the treatment meted out to the people of Kosovo.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister expect an Irish contingent will be ready to travel and will it comprise military or Garda personnel? Will he give an undertaking that there will be no question of sending privately hired personnel? Apparently the United States has decided to hire mercenaries to travel.  It would be grossly improper for this country to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on a previous occasion we would listen to our technical experts and propose, in the first instance, that 30 members of the Defence Forces would travel.  We would need the professional expertise of our Defence Forces who have performed honourably for many years in similar situations with enormous courage.  We would also consider the prospect of increasing that number to 50.  There is no question of civilians being sent; we need highly trained, highly alert individuals for this work. There is no question but it is a dangerous situation. As Deputy De Rossa implied, we will have to ensure, as far as possible, the safety of these personnel in the context of our international obligations.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour this point, but is the Minister aware that if the troops we sent to Kosovo had the opportunity to hone their experience within Partnership for Peace they would have been better equipped to do their job from the start?  Our Army troops and personnel are hampered because of our lack of willingness, unlike other European Union states, including neutral states such as Switzerland, and the former USSR states with the exception of Tajikistan, to participate in Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <P>That flies in the face of what is happening in relation to the specific organisation that is contemplating the complexity and organisation of the verification mission.  The OSCE is undertaking the mission.  We have been parties in an honourable and generous way to the OSCE mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have done great work there and that had nothing whatsoever to do with membership or otherwise of the PFP.  In a reply to a parliamentary question I undertook to open a national and internal debate on membership of the PFP and return to the House with the Government's decision on which a debate will take place in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the European Union's common position on East Timor, Ireland actively supports international efforts to promote respect for human rights and to bring about a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>Despite assurances by the new administration of President Habibie in Jakarta, it would appear that there has been no withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor.  There may even have been some increase in the total number of soldiers in the territory.  There also appears to have been increased military activity in the countryside although the capital city of Dili has been relatively calm.</P>
      <P>In recent months, nevertheless, a number of developments have occurred which may assist the efforts to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the issue of East Timor.  I am encouraged by the results of the meeting between the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal which took place in New York on 4-5 August last and were resumed at a further meeting last month.  I welcomed the agreement on these occasions to enter into in-depth negotiations on issues related to the question of East Timor without prejudice to each side's basic positions of principle.</P>
      <P>I also note with satisfaction the prospect for closer involvement of the East Timorese people in the search for a solution.  It is clear that the will of the Timorese people is vital and must be fully taken into account if a satisfactory solution is to be achieved.  It is not for us, however, to prejudge the final outcome of the process of self-determination in the territory of East Timor &mdash; this is a matter for the Timorese people.  What is clear is that the option of independence should exist if that is the choice of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had no direct contact in recent months with the Indonesian authorities on the question of East Timor.  I hope, however, to travel to Jakarta in the coming months for the purpose of visiting the imprisoned resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao.  I propose to avail of such an opportunity to have serious discussions with the <Col N="328" /> Indonesians on the question of East Timor and other issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to all those in Ireland, particularly the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign whom I have met on a number of occasions, for their efforts in focusing attention on the plight of the Timorese people.  I assure the House that I intend to continue working in support of all worthwhile initiatives which seek to improve the political, social and economic condition of the people of East Timor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, offer my congratulations to the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign which had humble origins but has been a very effective lobby group.  As the Minister will know, the Department has been supportive of that group of sensible people.  I, too, acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations in the context of the meetings with the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers. That is the way to make progress.  Am I right in assuming from the Minister's reply that he is also disappointed that the new administration in Indonesia seems to have gone back on its early assurances that there would be a new scenario in its dealings with East Timor?  There are reports of major offensives in East Timor and there has been an increase in troop levels throughout the island.  Will the Minister confirm if what we are hearing is true in that respect?</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's proposed visit to Indonesia to meet the jailed leader, Xanana Gusmao, and we offer our support for any efforts or dialogue in which he can engage.  It is important that Ireland continues to highlight the injustices in East Timor as we have done at European Union level and United Nations level.  I compliment the Minister on what he has done to date. If an opportunity arises, will he raise this matter directly with the Indonesian Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the honourable role played by the Deputy in regard to East Timor, particularly his support for the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign during his incumbency. Regarding the disappointment about the new administration appearing to have gone back on its assurances, there has been some dialogue since August.  I was encouraged by the results of the meeting between the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia which took place in New York on 4-5 August last.  As the Deputy said, matters have moved on in a negative way.  The soundings and intelligence information we have received do not bode well for the citizens of Dili and the people of East Timor in particular.  The matter is on the agenda of next Monday's General Affairs Council.  I will articulate the concern expressed by Deputy Spring about this matter. According to my information, matters have regressed rather than progressed.  It is for that <Col N="329" /> reason, among others, I welcome this question and the intervention.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to raise this matter and to continue raising it.  Will he also raise the related issue of Britain continuing to supply the Indonesian army with weapons despite the implementation of what has been referred to in Britain as, an ethical foreign policy?  It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 October that 64 licences for the export of weapons, including small arms, machine guns, mortars, flame throwers, ammunition, bombs, rockets, missiles, riot control agents and more, to Indonesia have been agreed.  It was reported that five battalions of the Indonesian army landed in East Timor in August last.  It was also reported that 200,000 people have died since 1975 as a result of the occupation of East Timor.  John Pilger has described it as a land of white crosses. It is urgent not only to raise this matter with the United Nations but to raise it with our partners in the European Union and ask them to please stop supplying the Indonesian army with the weapons of death.</P>

      <P>I have expressed the view here and elsewhere that the arms industry does not have any morality.  The Deputy is correct in what he said.  I am aware of what has been happening, as articulated by Deputy Spring.  It is a matter I will raise at the General Affairs Council on Monday in light of the known facts of what has been happening in what appeared to be a hopeful situation. It has become less hopeful, but I would not say it is hopeless.  I am aware the leader of the East Timor solidarity group is on his way there and may have already arrived.  I look forward to his safe return and to discussing once more his up-to-date assessment of the situation there.  I will be able to report to the House next week or thereafter, my contribution to the general affairs council and the intelligence I will have received from the East Timorese solidarity group.</P>

Ach ta go leor ceisteanna eile a bhaineann le gnáth-mhuintir na hÉireann, maidir le cúrsaí spóirt nach bhfuil chomh <Col N="331" /> sásúil agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do chuid acu sin anois.</P>
      <P>Participation in sport is often talked about. However, in reality it often meets various obstacles. I hope the main thrust of the sports council will be to use participation as a yardstick in the way it measures success in sport.  We are all agreed that we would want the broadest possible participation in sporting endeavour.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the community games organisation, which has done so much to promote the participation by young people in sports.  It has resulted in a number of our well known sportspeople coming to public attention.  People like Niall Quinn, Sonia O'Sullivan and many others often speak very highly of the voluntary effort put in by adults to the community games in which they participated in their younger days.</P>
      <P>As someone who trained to be a primary school teacher I can also vouch for the fact that many young people are first able to take up sport through primary schools.  A great deal of voluntary effort has been made in this area also.  Primary schools are also the first places where many children first encounter organised sport and it is important they have proper sporting facilities at their disposal.  They should at least have play-ground facilities that meet their needs.</P>
      <P>In looking for adequate playing facilities for young people, which may be termed the foundations of sporting involvement or the more recreational side of sport, I have found it very difficult to determine where responsibility lies among Departments for issues such as play facilities for children.  In approaching the Department of Health and Children I am told the matter is covered by the Child Care Act and issues to do with children suffering abuse or other difficulties. In approaching the Department of Education and Science I am told it deals with schooling issues while I am told by the Minister's Department that it is concerned with the organisational aspects of sport.</P>
      <P>There is a need for somebody to address the issue of playgrounds because insurance companies effectively deal with it at present when they dictate to local authorities that children must not be encouraged to play with organised facilities because of the risk of litigation and so on.  They are overplaying that concern.  There should be a reasonable arrangement.  What Department represents the interests of children in the area of recreational sport?  I hope the Minister will provide an answer, especially with regard to the issue of play facilities, when he responds to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to inclusiveness in a number of ways.  There are references to recreational and competitive sport.  Like other Deputies I have received representations from bridge players. Some have gone to the trouble of sending me the definition of sport as set out in Chambers Dictionary. According to the dictionary it means &ldquo;recreation; pastime; dalliance; amorous behaviour; play; a game, especially one involving bodily <Col N="332" /> exercise&rdquo;.  There is plenty of scope to be inclusive. Deputy Hanafin pointed out that a game like chess or bridge is to many, especially the elderly or disabled, the most physically and mentally stimulating game within their capabilities.  These games deserve the recognition as a sport currently denied to them.  I hope the Minister will address this in his reply.</P>
    <P>While it may be argued that contract bridge does not express or improve physical fitness, it nevertheless provides an outlet for many people who cannot or chose not to engage in strenuous physical activity.  Given that the Minister is obliged by his terms of office to take the broadest possible view and reflect the concerns of the community as a whole it should be possible that interests such as those involved in organising contract bridge are not excluded by the terms of the Bill.  Section 6 should, therefore, be amended on Committee Stage to include the recreational games I mentioned.  The Minister might exercise his prerogative in this regard.  I am sure the case made by the Contract Bridge Association is representative of the position of a great number of minority sports which give pleasure and enjoyment without attracting the attention of elite athletes, as they are often referred to.</P>
    <P>The issue of shared sporting facilities comes up time and again.  From dealing with these issues at local authority level I know many sports clubs are required to share facilities.  The main difficulty is that there are not enough facilities to share, which causes tension at times.  An example should be given by all sports organisations that where public resources are expended, facilities ought to be shared.  The money going to fund those resources is shared by all of us as taxpayers and that should determine the shared facility principle.  Publicly funded sports facilities are a relatively scarce resource.  I hope the enactment of the Bill will herald a new era in which establishing the sharing of sports facilities will be the norm.</P>
    <P>Safety is another issue which occupies the minds of everybody involved in sport, particularly parents of young people.  From reports and personal experience, we are all aware of accidents that have happened, but there are also a considerable number of near misses.  It is important to learn lessons from those who are involved in sport either through coaching, participation or as observers.  There was a very near miss during a recent national athletics contest when a child ran out in front of a javelin thrower.  The javelin missed the child by a matter of feet.  As a matter of priority we should pay considerable attention to increasing safety at sports facilities.</P>
    <P>Section 7 refers to sponsorship agreements.  I would like to tie this in with the section that deals with anti-doping to ensure sport is drug free.  I hope the long established practice of alcohol and tobacco companies becoming heavily involved in sports sponsorship can be challenged and faced down.  Many sponsors are benign in terms of the physical effect of their products on sports people, <Col N="333" /> but the record in terms of alcohol and cigarettes increasingly demonstrates they are not compatible with achieving excellence in sport.  It is a contradiction to try to challenge drugs in sport while at the time images that promote alcohol and cigarettes swamp both viewers and participants. When it comes to terms of reference, I hope sponsorship agreements will deliberately favour ethical sponsorship instead of alcohol and cigarette advertising.</P>
    <P>The section that relates to the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified or removed from membership of the sports council will I hope ensure we reflect on the experience of swimming, where questions arose as to whether a body should be suspended pending investigation. It would be an opportunity to put in place, rather than reacting to situations as they arise, some type of guidelines which could be referred to on the basis of experience.  That would ensure we could deal with those type of situations if they arise in the future.  Let us hope they will not, but experience teaches us that we must be prepared for such eventualities, as was referred to earlier concerning interference with swimmers.  I hope that can be dealt with to some extent in the course of the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable interest in this Bill.  People have told me they hope it will implement certain objectives.  Many people have referred to funding, which will always be a sore subject.  When we review lottery funding it should be borne in mind that the sports council might be the correct body to disburse it, given its terms of reference, rather than such funding being laid open to the charge of political favouritism, which has sometimes occurred.</P>
    <P>I hope the bias will be in favour of community facilities with the widest possible use.  It is difficult to reconcile the £250,000 given to the K-Club against the needs of junior football clubs and various other athletic organisations dealing with vast numbers of young people.  I hope the greatest number of people in need will benefit from the type of funding disbursed under the auspices of the sports council.</P>
    <P>In north Dublin many young people are involved in athletics and various other sporting pursuits.  They try hard to achieve and some of them are successful.  The irony is that the more successful they become the more expensive it is for them to continue in their particular sports. The Minister has assisted a number of elite athletes and recognises their needs.  A number of them must leave the country to train in warm weather which can place an enormous burden on them, something with which athletes from warmer climates do not have to cope.  A friend of mine from Lusk, John Carroll, is an athlete with a local athletics club.  He has been invited to participate in sporting events in London, Edinburgh and the south of France, but the huge financial burden that places on the families of such athletes should be taken into account.  These people are competing at an amateur level and have to pursue <Col N="334" /> academic and other careers.  It means that, effectively, they suffer for the sake of whatever glory Ireland manages to get from their achievements. I hope that will be recognised by the sports council so that support can be given more promptly when those needs arise.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in the media about building a national stadium and other facilities on greenfield sites.  I hope the amount of coverage given to such exciting proposals will not eclipse the needs of the many facilities around the country which manage to host sporting events, often in the most primitive conditions.  I realise the Morton Stadium in Santry is legendary in the number of events it has hosted.  It continues to be a very popular venue and has many admirable qualities.  Antrim also has a very fine sports facility for athletes.  That we have only one indoor 200 metre track in Nenagh, which is very much in need of investment, indicates that we really ought to look at facilities which are in place and make sure they can provide for young and up-and-coming athletes who will aspire to greater things. Then we can turn to the larger projects which will, in turn, be very welcome.  However, I hope larger projects will not be built at the expense of facilities dealing with events on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis but which are long overdue for investment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cuidiú leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Trevor Sargent, agus go h-áirithe, fáilte a cur roimh an Bille seo. Tá sé thar a beith tábhachtach, agus tá súl agam go mbeidh, mar a deirtear, toradh a shaothair ag an Aire atá againn inniu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be very important that the statutory basis for this council, which is now being put on a very firm footing, will yield significant results, not just for sportsmen but for the whole community in the future.  It is important that we have a Minister introducing this who is responsible for sport, tourism and recreation, because these are interlinked in many ways.  The impact our soccer team and our soccer supporters made during the great series of games in Europe and in the World Cup was very positive and created a very positive image of Ireland.  The old Dubliner who said on radio that they should be subsidised for going around the world cheering for Ireland because they were giving Ireland a great image was not too far wrong.  It is, in any event, appropriate that <Col N="335" /> a Minister with responsibility for all those areas should introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>It evokes a touch of nostalgia for me, because I set up the first sports council in 1971 which I called COSAC, Comhairle Sport agus Caitheamh Aimsire.  If I have any reservation about this Bill it is that the Minister has not found an Irish term for such a significant Irish promotion.  Another regret is that that sports council which was doing great work was allowed to die by my ministerial successor, the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.  It was revived when our distinguished former colleague, Jim Tunney relaunched it as Cospóir, putting his own stamp on it, which I perfectly well understood.</P>
    <P>Even at this remove, 28 years later, I would point out that those who made themselves available in a voluntary capacity at that time were people of total commitment, service and achievement. I recall Ron Delaney, former Olympic champion, Maeve Kyle, Joe Corr, Jim McKeever &mdash; one of the great Gaelic footballers from Derry &mdash; the late Judge Conroy, Lord Killanin, the former Commissioner Paddy Carroll, and Liam Gleeson who was a great pole vaulter for years.  I mention in particular Joe Connolly who launched the community games and who has done more than any one man to promote awareness of sport as a health activity for communities as well. Bobby Buckley, an enlightened administrator was anxious to ensure that grants that were being made available to him as a chief executive officer for his school in Tralee could be used for the community.  That kind of dynamic commitment set the pace for what turned out to be a very effective if short-lived effort at that time.  It will be noted also that the membership of that first sports council was not confined to any one part of the island &mdash; it had a North-South dimension, and that is of considerable importance.  No doubt the current Minister, who is from the most Northern county of all, will be very conscious of the positive potential of activities of this kind and the common bond of sportsmen.  As a Tipperary man, one thing that moves me to this day, as I found even during the by-election campaign, is the bond between sportsmen who made it tough and rough for each other on the playing fields years ago.  It is such a strong, deep bond of affection, loyalty and common purpose.  That is a great strength that this statutory council, when it is set up, will want to exploit.</P>
    <P>I trust that will not mean the voluntary organisations in communities in our towns and villages will be disadvantaged or that the statutory body will not take full account of the dynamic energy and positive contribution these voluntary organisations make.  I could elaborate at great length, but I do not need to do so because the Minister is conscious of it.  It is vitally important that the statutory body continues to be available to and continues to recruit the energy and commitment of all of these voluntary organisations throughout the country.  The most successful organisations <Col N="336" /> are largely built on a voluntary contribution.  This can be seen in Cumann Lúthchleas Gael which every day and every weekend, throughout the length and breadth of the country, is doing so much not just for the physical health but also for the psychological health and well being of our communities.  There are smaller organisations, and I am sure they will not be overlooked.  My total budget in the days when I set up the first sports council was only £100,000.  There was not too much that could be done with that, beyond relying on the impact some of the personalities I mentioned could make, which they did very effectively.</P>
    <P>The small organisations which cater for the disabled and the handicapped are of vital importance. While they may not always have the same high profile as the Olympic champions or the international golfers, they are an essential component. As a doctor, the Minister would be fully aware of that and I have no doubt he is also aware that it is a real measure of a common social commitment on the part of sportsmen which must be pursued.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound like I am denigrating small organisations, but over the years the Departments of Education and the Environment and county councils have grant aided many facilities in a haphazard way.  In every town there will be one school with a general recreational room, another with an outdoor playing area and another with a gymnasium.  Needless to say, the local hurling, football and swimming clubs also have requests for funding.  I would be the last to place any cap or restriction on voluntary organisations or schools but it is time, and I hope the council examines this, that we began to co-ordinate rather than spreading the money thinly.  Germany, Holland and other countries much wealthier than us have always insisted that there be one central complex in every town which every one can use.  It is essential the piecemeal development here be controlled, if not restricted, from now on. Otherwise we will not get the full benefit from what we are setting out to do.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in swimming.  I remember we organised an international sports medicine specialists conference in Dublin in 1971 or 1972. Specialists were happy to attend without our paying their expenses because we could not have done so if that had been a condition.  The theme which emerged from that conference was that swimming is the great health exercise in terms of its physical, psychological and aerobic impact. That being so, the Minister should ensure in the co-ordination which the council will set about achieving that swimming pools are as widely dispersed as possible throughout the country and that everyone is encouraged to avail of that wonderful natural facility around us.  Some of us, me included, do so all year round.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the council.  Its progress is in the hands of the Minister who has total commitment to it.  I hope the new chairman and all concerned will see that whatever observations <Col N="337" /> are made on the Bill and on their work are meant to be helpful and positive.  That is the spirit in which I express my views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great honour to speak after Deputy O'Kennedy who has obviously been involved at the outset in the development of sports policy.  Like him, I often immerse myself in very cold water in the Forty Foot which is in Deputy Barrett's constituency.  I appeal to Deputy Barrett to do something at local authority level to have the facility upgraded and developed for all the people of Dublin.  It is a fabulous facility.  Despite many protestations from the female of the species, women swim there every day alongside men and no discrimination exists there now.  I know the sign at the entrance is offensive to some women and I would not mind if it mysteriously disappeared some night without explanation.  I will leave that to Deputy Barrett who I am sure will be able to organise it.</P>
      <P>I was struck by Deputy Sargent's tribute to Noel Carroll.  I knew him in his many different public roles: as sportsman, spokesperson for Dublin Corporation and chief executive of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  In all these he played an outstanding role and was from an age in sport which is now almost gone.  He was a perfect role model in an age and a world where sport is increasingly becoming prey to commercial concerns and exploitation as well as to people peddling performance enhancing drugs of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Sargent when he makes the case for bridge.  Much as is my affection for that game &mdash; it is played by my mother and mother-in-law and was played by my late grandmother, such a sedentary and cerebral pursuit as bridge should not be classified as sport.  It would be a retrograde step.  I know the Minister is interested in and cognisant of the dynamic lobby on behalf of bridge and is keen to formulate a policy which would accommodate bridge, chess and other similar cerebral and sedentary pursuits in the recreation side of his portfolio. Given the earnestness with which he has applied himself to the development of sport in its purest form and definition, I have no doubt he will apply his agile mind to the business of encouraging people in more sedentary pursuits like bridge. Despite all the romanticising, speeches and laudatory words about sport, it is not for every individual. There are people who like to curl up with a good book or play a good game of chess and they should not be diminished for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of doping and the abuse of performance enhancing drugs in sport is at the heart of the debate on the sports council.  We must get to grips with this issue and I am happy the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is doing that.  However, he could do a little more.  The full sanction of the criminal law should be brought to bear on those who push drugs on players.  It is an abominable practice. Like many others who played rugby, I was shocked to hear of the recent revelations by Neil <Col N="338" /> Francis, against whom I played, in relation to the Irish Rugby Football Union.  They demand the introduction of more stringent powers.  I know the regime the Minister is planning to put in place is amongst the most stringent in the world. However, I still believe he could go that extra mile and invoke criminal sanctions so that people who unfairly pressurise, push or encourage young people into the use of performance enhancing drugs go to jail.  It is an abominable and life threatening practice.  There was considerable debate about the Joyner case and her early death and people are able to draw their own conclusions about her performances and medal victories. There is no point in developing the point here but there is a sad message in it for all sports people.</P>
    <P>The overall regulation of sport is now very important.  It is to the credit of the Taoiseach that sport is to the forefront of Government policy. Never before has there been a senior Minister with responsibility for sport and it is great that it has come about.  I hope that, if Deputy Barrett's party ever regains power, it will not reverse this decision and return to the bad old days when sport was relegated to a relatively minor junior ministry and regarded as a backwater, even if it did allow the Minister to attend matches around the globe.  Sport is now to the forefront of national policy and concerns.  What are the Minister's thoughts on the development of a national stadium?  A stadium is badly needed to cater for the needs of our soccer team.</P>
    <P>In the context of the North-South Council on which the Minister will interact with our British and Northern Ireland colleagues, does he plan to promote the idea of a united Irish soccer team, something about which people have spoken for many years?  It would provide a great boost.  The possible participation of an Irish based soccer team in a European super league should be considered.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by Deputy Gay Mitchell with Dr. A. J. F. O'Reilly with a view to hosting the Olympic Games should also be looked at. Our sports infrastructure should be developed to put us in a position where we can apply to host a major European event, if not the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's views on the generous offer of Mr. J. P. McManus of £50 million towards the cost of a national stadium?  Mr. McManus is known for his many betting coups on race courses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a wider dimension to sport.  With the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the Minister should consider whether the health promotion unit should be transferred to the Department for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The Minister for Health and Children has enough on his plate in the management of the health service.</P>
    <P>Sport is about educating young people how to look after their bodies.  In his first 100 days in office the Minister for Education and Science, <Col N="339" /> Deputy Martin, mentioned that sport may become part of the leaving certificate curriculum. I look forward to that day.  What are the Minister's thoughts on the subject?</P>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, raised a difficult issue, of which I am aware as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  A national audit of sports facilities should be conducted to prevent duplication.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also mentioned swimming pools.  I have made the point at meetings of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party that to eradicate social deprivation, disadvantaged areas should not be forgotten when it comes to investment in sports facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Sport is an international language which brings nations and communities together.  Ireland has been put on the international map by the achievements of our sports people.  I have been told by tourism interests that our greatest marketing tool in Europe, from Stuttgart in 1988 through to Rome in 1990, was our soccer team.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Irish Sports Council will be to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport; to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to co-ordinate their implementation; to facilitate standards of good conduct and fair play in competitive sport through the promulgation of guidelines and codes of practice; to take such action as it considers appropriate to combat doping in sport; to initiate and encourage research concerning competitive sport; to facilitate research and disseminate information concerning competitive sport and perform any additional functions assigned to it by the Minister by order.</P>
      <P>Each of these functions is laudable but there is a danger that in placing the council on a statutory footing we will undermine the efforts of those who participate voluntarily.  Most will never achieve excellence in competitive sport. Players like Roy Keane and Denis Irwin are few and far between.  Sport should be seen as a way of keeping young people out of trouble and of involving them in a healthy pursuit.  In areas of social deprivation it offers a way out. In a positive move GAA and soccer groups in my constituency of Cork North Central have come together to ensure young people can avail of the expertise of trainers and coaches at the desired level.  The success of sport is based on the voluntary effort of parents, teachers and community leaders in coaching and encouraging young people on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning.  The day we lose sight of this is the day sport will suffer at all levels.  Society will also suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the reports indicate that education and sport keep young people on the straight and narrow.  They are interlinked.  It is a positive <Col N="340" /> step to include physical education in the curriculum as it will instil confidence in young people.  In any class or club it is usual for one or two to be above average.  There is a tendency for the individual coach or teacher to look on them favourably to the detriment of the others. Sport encourages discipline and gives young people a sense of well being.  More importantly it encourages young people to seek excellence within their peer group.  Young offenders are often found to have dropped out of the school system and to have given up sporting activity for a variety of reasons.  Young people who drop out of sporting activity are often in danger of getting into trouble with the law.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the available recreation and sports facilities are not given maximum use. Huge sums of money have been invested on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis over many years.  Sports centres, running tracks, community halls and swimming pools are dotted throughout the country but they are useless without the enormous contribution of volunteers. If this voluntary contribution is not recognised it will be lost.  Voluntary coaches and sports organisers save the State huge sums every year and their contribution is enormous.  Unemployed people who are prepared to do this work should be paid a top-up amount and allowed to coach for a few hours while retaining unemployment benefit or assistance.  There must be some financial recognition of people who are prepared to get involved in coaching and organising on a voluntary basis.  In areas of high unemployment financial constraints often prevent people from participating in coaching and a co-ordinated approach must be taken to using the services of such volunteers.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has played hurling will understand the rivalry which can exist between parishes. Nonetheless, involvement in hurling or any team game allows those involved to meet and exchange views with sports people from other areas.  We must encourage participants in various sporting codes North and South to meet others from outside their own communities.  This could have a huge effect on solving the difficulties which are still experienced by people in Northern Ireland on a daily basis and could break down the barriers which exist between people in Northern Ireland and this side of the Border.  If such activity can be encouraged in children at a young age the mind set of prejudice will be eroded and chipped away.</P>
    <P>So long as sport brings huge financial rewards the use of performance enhancing drugs will be encouraged.  Only a percentage of sports people will avail of them but those who train hard and live a disciplined life to achieve excellence will suffer unfairness.  Athletes who use such drugs are victims of a larger evil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a tale of how the Exchequer has been ripped off to the extent of millions of pounds by the deliberate action of servants of the State either at political instigation or by mere complicity in unlawful collusion with companies in the beef processing sector who were the intended beneficiaries of the scam.</P>
      <P>Legal costs of more than £1 million arising from unnecessary and wasteful litigation in which the Department of Agriculture and Food embroiled itself have last week been discharged by the State.  General damages awarded to the injured party have yet to be assessed but will exceed the amount already paid out for costs by an unknown factor.  The Department of Agriculture and Food ignored all entreaties to desist and no other agency of the State would agree to intervene.  Attempts by some politicians from inside and outside Government to terminate this madness were fought off by the Department on the grounds that they were likely to succeed in court.  The facts may be complex but are quite straightforward.</P>
      <P>Arising from the then GATT the EU was obliged to import a small amount of beef from third countries.  Ireland's share was 400 tonnes divided by licence among the main beef companies including several companies in the Goodman group.  They did not import the beef but sold their quotas almost entirely to a firm called Emerald Meats.  The rules were changed in 1989 arising from an unrelated court judgment in that the EU Commission took over allocation of the quotas from the Department.  The Commission introduced a regulation binding on member states that would give the quotas to &ldquo;the traditional importers&rdquo;.  Therefore, in Ireland the law now dictated that these quotas should go to Emerald Meats.  In blatant contravention of the law the other beef companies, predominantly the Goodman group, and the Department of Agriculture and Food officials conspired knowingly to misrepresent the historical position to Brussels.  The Department furnished a fictional list of traditional importers to Brussels described subsequently by Mr. Justice Declan Costello as a travesty of the true position.</P>
      <P>The Department then set about doing down Emerald Meats and asserting the claims of Larry Goodman and others in Brussels and this led to a complaint by the managing director of Emerald Meats to the Garda Síochána in February 1990 that there was &ldquo;a conspiracy to defraud my company of its entitlements under EU and Irish law&rdquo;. To my knowledge no action was taken by the Garda and similar complaints to the Department were ignored.  Emerald Meats was left with no alternative but to carry out its threat to sue the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> In the ensuing years Emerald Meats was comprehensively vindicated in the courts on all counts.  Mr. Justice Egan's judgment made it clear that the Department of Agriculture and Food could not hope to win an appeal but the Department carried on regardless.  The Supreme Court in March 1997 rejected every one of the Department's legal arguments and ruled that in addition to specific damages Emerald Meats was entitled to general damages which are not yet assessed.</P>
    <P>The State is occasionally forced into litigation on constitutional or other grounds that are difficult to explain to the taxpayer.  No such grounds existed in this case.  This was a case of conspiracy between the Department, Goodman and others to steal from a rival company.  It would be a serious matter in any circumstances but it is especially grave when the Department involved has already been indicted of an unacceptably cosy relationship with the dominant group of companies in the sector.  This is the same Department whose negligence in supervising the depredations of the same group in another context led to fines of up to £70 million being imposed on the State.</P>
    <P>At the height of the 1990 controversy the Minister told the House that he would seek to recover the money from the companies concerned.  The Secretary of the Department told the Committee of Public Accounts that the necessary steps were being taken to get moneys from the companies involved.  Eight years after that first commitment a spokesman for the Department told <i>The Irish Times</i> last week that no attempt has been made to recover the money from the companies involved.  Why did the Department become wantonly entangled in a conspiracy to ruin a small company to the benefit of giant competitors who had not bothered to use their import licences?</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the Department is on record as saying, &ldquo;Did we ever think they would?&rdquo;.  Why did the Garda not act on complaints made to them?  Why did the Department persist in wasteful and expensive litigation when it had fabricated documents and lied to Brussels? What was in it for the Department or the officials concerned?  Were they acting at the behest of their political masters?  Has there ever been an internal investigation of the scandalous handling of the licence applications, given the heavy cost to the taxpayer?  Has anyone been made accountable for misrepresenting the true position?</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts should be asked by this House to use the new compellability regime to investigate the detail of a scandal that reflects discredit on a major Department and the climate of favouritism instigated by Ministers at that time and since towards the Goodman group and no credit on the Garda who, if they had acted on complaints made to them, might have spared the taxpayer millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>I will briefly outline the background to this matter before I deal with the topic of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> As is evident from the subject of this debate, the legal proceedings taken by Emerald Meats against the Department go back many years to 1990.  The essence of these legal proceedings concerned a decision taken by the Department in relation to a dispute between Emerald Meats and various beef processors about entitlement to GATT import licences for frozen beef.  The dispute arose because of a change at EU level in relation to the administration of the GATT licensing system which was transformed from a nationally managed system to a Community managed system.</P>
    <P>The new system for allocating the licences was based on the quantity of beef imported by traders in previous years under GATT licences issued under the old system and the dispute arose over whether the new licences should be issued to the processors to whom the old licences had been issued or to Emerald Meats which imported the beef under these licences.  The Department, acting on legal advice on the matter, awarded the licences to the meat processors.  Emerald Meats took legal proceedings against the Department in the High Court, which ruled that the licences should have been allocated to Emerald Meats and which awarded special damages to the company. The Department was joined by the various meat processors as defendants in the case.  Both the Department and the meat processors appealed the judgment to the Supreme Court which upheld the judgment of the High Court and also gave Emerald Meats leave to seek general damages against the Department.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the issue of recovery of the meat processors' share of the legal costs, plus interest, which have been incurred by the State arising from the legal action taken by Emerald Meats.  Both the High Court and the Supreme Court ordered the Department to recover from the meat processors 50 per cent of the legal costs paid by the Department to the legal representatives of Emerald Meats in respect of this case.</P>
    <P>I will now inform the House of the steps taken by the Department to enforce this order.  The Department was informed by the Chief State Solicitor on 28 September that legal costs of Emerald Meats had been taxed by the Taxing Master at £374,060.14, not including interest.  The Department immediately drew the attention of the Chief State Solicitor to the order of the High Court and the Supreme Court relating to the recovery of costs and asked that processors should be required to pay their share of the costs.  The Chief State Solicitor replied on 21 October that legal advice from counsel was that the Department was obliged to pay the full legal costs and subsequently seek to implement the order against the processors.  In light of this legal advice, the Department dealt with the matter without delay and has paid both the legal costs and associated interest charges to the legal representatives of Emerald Meats.</P>

I understand the Chief State Solicitor has instructed a firm of legal cost accountants to initiate the process of recovery in accordance with the orders of the court.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that there has been no delay on the part of the Department in paying the costs or in seeking to implement recovery of the costs from the processors.  According to the legal advice given to the Department, it was not possible for recovery to be made until such time as the Department had first paid the costs.  Immediately these costs were paid, the Department instructed the Chief State Solicitor to enforce the court ruling. I am fully committed to implementing the ruling as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  The full horror of the abuse and neglect suffered by children was detailed in a special investigation which was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Monday.  With 3,700 children now in care and more than 100 appearing before the children's court in Dublin every week, the care system is at breaking point as it staggers from crisis to crisis trying to deal with the appalling tales of tragedy.</P>
      <P>The following is a list of some of the shocking cases highlighted in the newspaper: a child was raised in a tea chest until he was five years old; a 15 year old girl was found living in a squat with winos and had been used for prostitution; a young person had assaulted a teacher and refused to have anything to do with water until it was discovered that a relative had brutally beaten and tried to drown him; a child had a nail driven through his hand by his drunken father and a girl was beaten and used for prostitution by her father before she had reached her teens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children said the report was horrendous and that we could not underestimate the extent of the problem.  The Minister said the system is overrun by the number of children who are neglected in one way or another.  The system should ensure that the institutions of the State respond to children who are neglected and abused. <Col N="345" /> It was said at a recent conference that a country is judged on how it treats its children.  Since its formation the Government has not shown itself to be children-friendly; it has failed our children. Children's issues have a low priority.  Mr. Justice Kelly was correct when he stated in the High Court in July that &ldquo;dysfunctional and inadequate families are being cared for by dysfunctional and inadequate services&rdquo;.  The Government has not honoured its commitment to provide adequate, secure and high support places for troubled children.  It must immediately provide funding for proper services.</P>
    <P>On 25 April an eight year old child was brutally raped in Cork.  The offender has not yet been apprehended.  Paedophiles released from prisons are fleeing from the sex abuse register in the UK and Northern Ireland and are free to move at will throughout the State.  We must urgently introduce a register for child sex offenders.  This has been long fingered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who says he needs another report.  Our children need protection and the Government should have accepted my Private Members' Bill to establish such a register earlier this year.</P>
    <P>In early July the Taoiseach could not indicate when the office of the children's ombudsman would be established.  It is obvious that this is near the bottom of the Government's priority list. That is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister to state the Government's intention to establish this office.  We urgently need such an office to promote and protect children's rights.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman's office should have a role in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It should ensure that the voices of children are heard in policy and administrative processes.  This would help to create an environment more favourable to the protection of children's rights.  It should be established on a statutory basis to give it stability and independence and it should be answerable to the Oireachtas.  It should be independent of Departments so that it has the freedom to deal with all public bodies related to children.</P>
    <P>The Children's Bill passed Second Stage 17 months ago and was reintroduced and referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights in July.  However, there is no sign of that Bill coming before the committee.  I inquired from the committee today why that was the case and I was informed it was waiting to hear from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform when the Minister would be ready to deal with it.  It is a disgrace that we must keep pushing for such important legislation after 17 months.</P>

      <Col N="346" /> Deputies will be aware that the Child Care Act, 1991, has been fully implemented since the end of 1996.  Very significant resources have been made available to support the full implementation of the Act.  Since 1993 and the end of 1997 an additional £43.5 million has been made available to health boards for this purpose.  In 1998, a further £8 million was made available.  These are very significant additional resources and the level of investment has made possible the creation of almost 1,000 additional posts to deliver the services which the Act requires to be delivered.</P>
    <P>While much has been done, much remains to be done.  There is no doubt that many children still suffer from neglect and are abused.  The services are attempting to respond to these problems and it is important that resources continue to be made available for this purpose.  I would like to outline briefly some of the principal supports that are made available to children at risk.</P>
    <P>First, health boards are involved in family support work.  It is important that where possible, families who are experiencing difficulties should receive appropriate intervention from the statutory agencies.  I hope the boards will be in a position to further develop these important services in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Second, an expert group has recently been established to inquire into the increasing number of children coming before the Children's Court. The group will examine the following issues: intervention and prevention strategies; the reasons for the increase in the number of children coming before the courts; the behavioural patterns of children coming before the courts in the lead-up to their appearance; non-custodial options open to the courts and best practice models in this country and in other countries where community sanctions are in place.  Research is also being commissioned into an examination of the profile and numbers of children coming before the Children's Court and their behavioural patterns.</P>
    <P>Third, last January, the Government established the young people at risk programme and approval was given for funding of £2.4 million for each of the years 1998, 1999 and 2000.  This funding is to be used for 12 family support projects, spread throughout the eight health board regions. The objective of the projects is to prevent children at risk and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a pro-active response to the children and their families.</P>
    <P>The pilot projects meet a need identified in Partnership 2000 which noted that:</P>
    <P>The tackling of social exclusion requires an integrated approach, with full inter-sectoral co-ordination and appropriate mid to short-term and strategic long-term measures.  The scale and concentration of disadvantage in certain areas of Dublin requires a strategic and targeted response.  This must be multi-dimensional and must be targeted in such a way as to <Col N="347" /> reach the individuals and communities directly affected.</P>
    <P>Fourth, Deputies will be aware that the Garda, through the juvenile liaison officer scheme operate a highly effective diversion programme for children and young people who would otherwise be dealt with through the juvenile justice system with the consequent risk of being stigmatised for their behaviour and this scheme will continue to be prioritised.</P>
    <P>High support and special care units are being developed for children whose needs cannot be responded to in a community setting.  The article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> addressed many of the issues which our statutory and voluntary services respond to on a daily basis.  There are no simple solutions to many of these problems which have their origins in the rapid change which our society has experienced.  The Government is very conscious of its responsibilities in this area and will continue to address them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister with responsibility is not in the House but I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will give Threshold good news. In the context of the current housing crisis it is essential that necessary housing advice and assistance be made available.  A deal between a purchaser and a vendor takes place within quite a short timeframe.  Equally when a tenant attempts to gain advice on his or her rights it is often immediately required.</P>
      <P>The housing market is complex.  People who do not know the rights and responsibilities of a tenant frequently have to make very important decisions within a matter of days.  I think I speak on behalf of all Members when I say the work of Threshold in giving direct advice in the housing market provides an indispensable service.  Threshold is the only free and independent housing advice agency in the State.  In recent years, the volume of queries which have come directly into its offices have more than doubled.  In 1992, 6,000 people sought advice and by 1997 this had risen to more than 15,000.</P>
      <P>Putting it bluntly, Threshold can no longer cope with the volume of queries unless immediate action is taken by the Government to substantially increase the core funding provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on an annual basis.  In 1992, £65,000 was provided by the Department which by 1997 had risen to just £80,000.  When this is compared with the doubling of queries, the scale of the problem is easily identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has deteriorated because of the huge public interest in the services provided by Threshold.  One caller is turned away every 15 minutes.  There was a 12 per cent increase in queries to Threshold advice centres last year.  People with queries relating to all types of housing issues <Col N="348" /> can no longer receive the service they require because of difficulties in funding.  It now takes up to one week for a client of Threshold to be given an interview involving detailed case work and advice.</P>
    <P>Threshold can no longer cope with the demand for its services.  It employs five full-time advisers in its offices in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  They provide specialist assistance to thousands of people looking for immediate guidance and advice.  While a core element of funding for Threshold exists through the annual subvention from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, a tiny fraction of its annual budget consists of local authority contributions. The State must contribute a large amount of funding towards this essential service.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that an additional £100,000 is required next year for Threshold to provide a daily service.  All Members will be aware that consistent fundraising by such organisations can sap the energy of volunteers and full-time staff. Threshold provides an invaluable service and it is not beyond the bounds of financial flexibility for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to substantially increase its funding in 1999.</P>
    <P>In preparing next year's departmental Estimates, the Minister should consider the need for a specific subhead for housing assistance and advice.  Unless we establish a pool of funding for this aspect of housing policy, we will not make much progress as regards the thousands of people looking for advice on a daily basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, regrets that he is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The voluntary housing sector has a key role, in partnership with local authorities, in meeting social housing needs.  This includes the direct provision of housing or, in Threshold's case, the provision of housing advisory and research services. As the House is well aware, the Department of the Environment and Local Government provides funding, through the local authorities, to voluntary housing bodies to provide rented housing for people in need.  Between the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes, capital funding of more than £47 million was provided this year for such projects.  The Government is committed to a continued voluntary housing programme and will make appropriate financial provision in the forthcoming Estimates for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to capital funding towards building projects, a small number of voluntary agencies who provide housing advice and assistance also receive funding from the Department in respect of their administrative and general expenses. Four hundred and twenty two thousand pounds was made available this year for these purposes and was allocated to bodies including Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Irish Council for Social Housing, <Col N="349" /> the National Association of Building Cooperatives, Respond, Rural Resettlement Ireland, St. Pancras Ireland and the Simon Community. Threshold was the recipient of the largest allocation to any organisation from this source in 1998, some £80,000.  Earlier this year, Threshold also sought financial assistance towards the organisation of a symposium on the challenges currently facing the private rented sector.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was glad to be able to help with the request and announced, in September last, assistance of £12,000 towards the cost of its symposium, in addition to the funding of £80,000 already allocated in 1998.</P>
    <P>Threshold's application for increased funding towards its general and administrative expenses will be considered in the context of the 1999 Estimates generally and, of course, having regard to the requirements of other organisations providing services in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  Malahide Community School is one of the largest and most successful post-primary schools in Fingal.  It has a current enrolment of 1,002 students with a projected enrolment of 1,080 from September 1999.  Given the difficulties the board of management and staff are encountering with the Department regarding the delay in resolving major outstanding matters in the school, the parents' council is threatening to take action publicly to highlight the problems.</P>
      <P>There are four main areas of concern, the first being the need for a science room.  This has been on the agenda for some time.  The science facilities are totally inadequate and classes must take turns to avail of the existing facilities.  How can teachers be expected to teach science subjects effectively in an ordinary classroom?</P>
      <P>The PE hall, which was used extensively by the school and the wider community, was closed recently by the board of management on the instructions of the Department of Education and Science because the asbestos roof was leaking and was deemed unsafe.  This is causing major problems for the operation of the school.  Some students must be bussed to the Portmarnock sports and leisure club at substantial additional cost to the board of management.  The remaining students do their PE in the yard or on the open space, and neither they nor their teachers are looking forward to the dark, damp afternoons. Can they be blamed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The septic tank is a matter of grave concern to the parents and teachers but the officials appear to have been dragging their feet for the past ten years.  It must be piped out every week at a cost of £350 a time and it is a health hazard.  This matter must be taken seriously and tackled immediately &mdash; there is no benefit in waiting for Fingal County Council to come up with proposals which <Col N="350" /> may take years to implement.  A private treatment plant must be installed immediately, as is happening elsewhere across the country, pending the school being connected to an upgraded Malahide sewage treatment plant some time in the future.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the school extension.  The projected number for September 1999 is 1,080 pupils and it is imperative that the necessary steps are taken to have permanent accommodation ready by August 1999 at the latest.  Apart from the immediate requirements, the issue of how large the school should be allowed to grow in the interests of the best education of the students must be addressed by the board of management and the Department.  A school with such high student numbers should be entitled to a second vice-principal post and I strongly recommend to the Minister that such an allocation be made, if possible by next September.</P>
    <P>As a former member of the board of management I compliment the principal and teachers of Malahide Community School for their commitment to the education of the students over the years under such difficult circumstances.  Parents are rightly demanding action.  On their behalf I look forward to a favourable response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science &mdash; unfortunately he had a prior commitment.  He wishes to thank the Deputy for raising the matter because it gives him the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the proposed works at Malahide Community School.  This is a co-educational school with a current enrolment of 1,002 pupils. The Minister is aware that the school authorities have a number of applications with the Department at the moment.</P>
      <P>In November 1997 the Department received an application from the school regarding repairs to the roof in the sports hall.  The Department commissioned a report and it was decided that for health and safety reasons the hall should be closed pending the replacement of the roof. Officials in the planning and building unit are treating this project as extremely urgent and have instructed the consultant architect to seek tenders for these works immediately.  This process is now under way.  As with all applications for public funding, certain technical evaluations must be carried out and public procurement procedures must be followed.  It is intended that this work will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1998 the principal made a request for additional accommodation at the school due to the growing population trends in the Malahide area.  In order to process this application further, a form ST1, which is the Department's official application for post-primary accommodation, was forwarded to and completed by the school in July 1998.  This request is currently being examined in terms of enrolment, future viability and cost implications within the Department.  The Deputy can be assured that this examination will be dealt <Col N="351" /> with and a decision conveyed to the school authorities as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>An application from Malahide community school for the provision of a science laboratory is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  A number of minor issues on the tender documentation are being clarified by the design team. When these issues have been clarified to the satisfaction of his Department, the question of proceeding to tender will be considered in terms of available resources and completing priorities.</P>
    <P>The school has also indicated that there has been longstanding problem with the drainage system in the area.  Following a meeting with the school authorities in August 1998, the Department wrote to the county engineer in Fingal County Council to inquire about its plans in relation to extending the existing system to <Col N="352" /> include the area in which the community school is located.  The Department is currently in contact with the local authority in this regard and it is intended to hold a further meeting with it shortly.</P>
    <P>The Department is also aware that the school is experiencing problems with heating in the PE hall.  The current position is that the planning and building unit has requested the school to submit a more specific report regarding the type of heating problem occurring in the school.  This response is currently awaited.</P>
    <P>With regard to leaks in the flat roof at the school, the Department is currently monitoring this problem and has requested that a maintenance manual and details of the roof guarantee be submitted to the Department immediately.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 November 1998. <Col N="353" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>All overflights of the State by foreign military aircraft are governed by the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952.  This provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over the State save on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is also provided, in relation to requests for permission to overfly the State, that the Minister may impose such conditions as he considers appropriate.  In the case of Northern Ireland, there are long-standing arrangements for aircraft from one jurisdiction to fly, with permission and subject to strict conditions, for a short distance into the other jurisdiction to help in dealing with specific incidents or suspected explosive devices.  Such oversights are also subject to the terms of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952. The overnight into County Louth by a British military aircraft on 15 October 1998 was effected under these arrangements.  In accordance with the normal practice in relation to security matters.  I do not propose to go into any further detail.</P>
      <P>Permission to overfly is given for a variety of purposes, including VIP transport and search and rescue.  A number of different channels of communication are used, depending on the purpose of the flight, and in a number of cases security considerations apply.  For these reasons, I do not propose to provide a total figure for authorised oversights.  Deputies may take it, however, that flights of the type undertaken on 15 October occur infrequently and there are clear security and safety reasons for them.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies that any unauthorised crossings of the Border, whether by air or otherwise, have always been viewed by the Government as a very serious matter.  All reported incursions by British security force personnel into this jurisdiction are raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-lrish Secretariat in Belfast and they are appraised of our strong concerns.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1998, we have raised four reports of unauthorised overflights with the British side.</P>

      <P>Ireland and the European Union have a particular interest in a stable Russia and in the development of a strong and dynamic partnership between Russia and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 17 August, when the government devalued the rouble and announced a moratorium on certain debt repayments, there has <Col N="355" /> been considerable economic upheaval in Russia. As Deputies will be aware, on 11 September last, President Yeltsin's nomination of Mr. Yeveny Primakov as Prime Minister was approved by the Russian Duma.  Since then, Prime Minister Primakov has completed the difficult task of assembling a new government to include representatives of a broad cross-section of political parties.  He is leading the continuing efforts to address the major financial and economic issues facing the country.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Primakov has said that he will not abandon the reform process endeavour to give it a more human social face.  This policy appears to command widespread support in Russia. Given the scale of Russia's problems, the situation there cannot be resolved instantly.  Farreaching structural reforms are required to improve economic performance while at the same time benefiting the general population.</P>
    <P>Prior to the current crisis, Ireland's economic relations with the Russian Federation had been developing well.  Ireland has enjoyed strong surplus with Russia for a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is not yet possible to quantify the effects of the crisis on our exports to Russia but there is no doubt that the second half of 1998 will show a substantial decrease in exports.</P>
    <P>Beef is our principle export to Russia and sales have fallen sharply.  In September, Russia's imports of food products overall fell to a sixth of their previous level.  However, in view of Russia's heavy reliance on imported food, it may be expected that imports will pick up again.</P>
    <P>Some Irish companies in Russia continue to trade at a reasonable level but the loss of purchasing power among middle-class customers in Moscow will have implications for the short to medium term.  The banking system is in difficulties with the result that effective payments mechanisms are lacking.  In the longer term, given Russia's population and natural resources, I believe that it will continue to have economic potential as a market for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The EU's ability to influence events in Russia is limited.  It is clear that the main steps to resolve the economic and financial situation will have to be taken by Russia itself.  Nevertheless.  it is important that the EU's links with Russia are maintained and that the partnership which has been established between the EU and Russia is preserved and enhanced.  This is in the EU's interest as well as Russia's.  Ireland strongly supports the Union's approach to date on targeted assistance to Russia and believes it is crucial that the EU together with other members of the international community continue to make clear that they stand ready to provide support, and assistance as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs in September 1997 there have been no discussions at the General Affairs Council of incidents of racism and xenophobia within the EU, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy should be aware that the General Affairs Council, at its meeting on 2 June 1997, approved the establishment of the European Monitoring centre on Racism and Xenophobia and the centre, which is based in Vienna, opened in January of this year.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the monitoring centre is to provide the community and its member states with objective, reliable and comparable data at European level on the phenomena of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism in order to help them when they take measures or formulate courses of action within their respective spheres of competence.</P>
      <P>The initiative for the establishment of this centre stemmed from a decision taken at the European Council in Cannes in June 1995 when it was agreed that a consultative commission be established to study the feasibility of establishing a European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supported the initiative to establish the new European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and we will continue to support action at EU level aimed at combating racism and xenophobia.</P>
      <P>I should also like to advise the Deputy that the 1996 EU Joint Action on Racism and Xenophobia continues to be pursued in the context of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The joint action was aimed at improving judicial co-operation between member states in the fight against racism and xenophobia and the report presented to the May JHA Council indicated that member states have, to a very large extent, implemented the provisions of the joint action.</P>

      <P>I give the closest attention to the export trade in beef and have instructed that the Department ent of Foreign Affairs should accord a high priority to facilitating this very important export business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in exports relates principally to securing market access for Irish products.  In this it works closely <Col N="357" /> with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In the third country markets which are so important for the Irish beef trade, sustained diplomatic and ministerial contacts have ensured that the quality of Irish produce and our high veterinary standards are made known to the authorities of the importing countries.  As a result, markets in Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have been open to Irish beef virtually without interruption over the last three years.  Following extended contacts through the Embassy in Tehran, the Minister for Agriculture has recently announced a new veterinary agreement with Iran which should enable exports to that country to resume shortly.  I am confident that when the present economic difficulties in Russia are overcome, Russian buyers also will return to Irish meat factories for supplies.  A Libyan delegation came to Dublin this summer at my invitation, and agreed to reopen the Libyan market to live cattle from Ireland.  I expect this agreement to be implemented very shortly.</P>
    <P>Within the European Single Market, Irish beef is traded freely.  Irish Embassies in those countries are fully supportive of the marketing activities of An Bord Bia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is actively involved in the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, including its North-South dimension.  An inter-departmental committee on the implementation of the Agreement is chaired by a senior officer of the Department.  Four departmental officials are working full-time on the North-South aspects, in close co-operation &mdash; operation with officials of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Together, and in conjunction with officials from the Department of Finance and of the Office of the Attorney General, they are co-ordinating at official level preparations across the range of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The House will appreciate, given the sensitivity of the discussions in which the Government is engaged with the Northern parties on the identification of initial areas for North-South co-operation &mdash; operation and implementation, that I am not in a position to comment in detail on individual possibilities.  As the Taoiseach has said, we wish to see Implementation Bodies established in substantial and meaningful areas, particularly in economic sectors.  In addition, the North-South Ministerial Council itself will provide a vehicle for systematic and structured co-operation &mdash; operation across the whole range of our shared interests and concerns.</P>
    <P>With specific reference to the matters mentioned in the two questions, I can confirm that, in the view of the Government, the arts, in which there is already a good level of co-operation between North and South, is one of many areas where there is substantial scope for mutually beneficial future co-operation.  While foreign policy and international relations are not among the matters to be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and so will not fall to be considered by the North-South Ministerial Council, my Department, given its North-South and Anglo-Irish responsibilities, will be closely involved in the process of North-South operation and in the development of the new North-South institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">

      <P>Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in Africa, is struggling to recover from the genocide of 800,000 people and the return of 1.4 million refugees. Most of the assistance provided by the Irish Government goes towards rehabilitation programmes which aim to meet basic humanitarian needs in the areas of shelter, health and food security.  In addition, the rebuilding of civil society and of the system of justice are crucial if the cycle of violence and impunity is to be broken.  Ireland supports a number of projects which aim to contribute to the establishment of conditions leading to a peaceful, just and stable society.  In providing rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to Rwanda, we are also seeking to prevent even greater instability in the country itself and in the Great Lakes region as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding is channelled through Irish NGOs, international agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Development Programme.  Some support has been given to the Government for specific projects to assist institution building and human resource capacity.  This includes training health <Col N="359" /> care workers and providing training, including human rights training, for the communal police. Ireland has been able to use the channel of a UNDP Trust Fund in Rwanda, as a way to ensure complementarity with other donors and to increase the effectiveness of assistance through joint funding of particular projects.</P>
    <P>The centrality of human rights is also reflected in the objectives and priorities of the European Union in its relations with Rwanda as reflected in its relevant Common Position which was adopted with Ireland's support by the General Affairs Council on 30 March, namely to encourage, stimulate and support the process of recovery from genocide; promotion of national reconciliation, reconstruction and development and transition to democracy; and protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    <P>These issues were raised with the Rwandan authorities during the EU Ministerial Troika to that country in June.  Along with our European partners we have unequivocally condemned the killings of innocent civilians and refugees by all sides to the conflict in Rwanda and called for the full investigation of such incidents.</P>
    <P>The Government remains firmly of the view that such objective human rights safeguards, with effective investigative and judicial follow-up, are essential if lasting stability and inclusive democratic government are to be achieved in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that full observance of human rights and the rule of law will continue to be a core objective of the Government's policy in relation to Rwanda. Along with our EU partners and through the continued good offices of the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, we will continue to support, as appropriate, the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to achieve these goals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, in general, that any allegations of serious human rights abuses should be investigated fully.  However, the question of the extradition <Col N="360" /> of General Pinochet from Britain to Spain and that of the jurisdiction of Spanish or other courts in prosecuting him are primarily judicial issues.  Accordingly, this matter was not on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 26 October and no discussions took place at that meeting.</P>
    <P>As regard the question of whether Irish citizens were victims of killings, disappearances of torture in Chile during the military dictatorship led by General Pinochet from 1973 to 1990, I am not aware of any Irish victims.</P>
    <P>On 13 October, Spanish judicial authorities filed a petition with the British authorities seeking to question General Pinochet in the United Kingdom in the course of investigations into serious human rights violations committed against Spanish citizens in Chile during the period of the military dictatorship.  They also wished to question him in relation to crimes against people of several nationalities during the so-called Operation Condor.  This was a mechanism, co-ordinated by the Chilean secret police to co-operate in the tracking down of dissidents in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.  General Pinochet was issued with an arrest warrant on 16 October when the Spanish investigating judges made clear their intention to seek his extradition to Spain.  He was placed under guard at the London clinic where he was receiving medical treatment.</P>
    <P>On 28 October the High Court in London found in favour of General Pinochet's claim against his arrest, ruling that, as a Head Of State at the time of the alleged offences, he was immune from prosecution.  I understand that the Crown Prosecution Service is appealing the decision to the House of Lords, which began hearing the case earlier this week.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings have also been continuing in Spain.  Both Britain and Spain have made clear that decisions will be taken by their judicial authorities. In Britain, the issue is the legality of General Pinochet's arrest.  In Spain, it has been whether the investigating judge, Mr. Baltasar Garzon, has jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed outside Spain by a non-Spanish national.  Pending resolution of these matters, I understand that no formal request to extradite him has been issued by the Spanish authorities.</P>
    <P>Abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to the entire international community. Throughout the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by the regime.  We expressed sympathy with the victims of those violations and we accepted Chilean refugees into Ireland.  While I believe that the perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice, this can only be done in accordance with the jurisdiction and laws of the countries concerned, or within the framework of specific international legal instruments. <Col N="361" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Since last August's US missile attack on the Al Shifa chemical plant near Khartoum which coincided with a similar attack on a target in Afghanistan, there has been some questioning of the claim by the US authorities that they had acted upon the basis of evidence that the Al Shifa plant was engaged in the production of agents for chemical weapons.  As part of this questioning process, the Sudanese Govermnent has made a request to the United Nations Security Council, with support from a number of other states, for an investigation.  This has led to informal consultations on the possible tabling of a draft resolution requesting the UN Secretary General to dispatch a fact-finding mission to the Al Shifa site.  The purpose of this mission would be to study whether the plant there was involved in the production of chemical weapon ingredients and if there were links between the plant and the Usama bin Laden terrorist network.  These informal consultations are continuing.</P>
      <P>The Government remains of the view that it is important that this issue be resolved between the United States and Sudan in accordance with the principles of the UN charter and of international justice an in a manner which will contribute to the fight against international terrorism.  We therefore welcome the continuation of informal consultations between the UN Security Council, as the competent international authority, Sudan, the United States and other Governments, on this matter in accordance with these principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned both at the suffering caused by the current conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and also the risk that it will escalate into a regional war.  Of particular concern at this time are the increased militarisation of the crisis and the internationalisation of the conflict through the direct involvement of neighbouring states.  Ethnic differences are being exploited for short-term gain by forces who attach no value to long-term stability.  The progress which had been made towards resolving the appalling legacy of the 1994 genocide and responding to the impact of the subsequent return to their home countries of millions of refugees, is now under serious threat.  Ireland, our EU partners and other international donors, therefore will work to support peace efforts as well as continuing generous support for the normalisation of life for the peoples of the Great Lakes region.</P>
      <P>The cycle of genocide, ethnic violence and human rights abuse in the region must be broken if lasting stability is to be achieved.  We therefore strongly support the work of the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aido Ajelio, who is actively supporting the peace efforts of the Presidents of Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and regional organisations.  These are aimed at securing early agreement between the conflicting parties to a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  This would involve a military standstill and an undertaking by the conflicting parties to refrain from further offensive action.  Such agreement would facilitate negotiations aimed at a lasting political settlement including the withdrawal of outside military forces.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Government and our EU partners are maintaining our support of the Arusha peace process in Burundi.  This is making some progress within agreed negotiating structures under the facilitation of former President Nyerere of Tanzania.  In the case of Rwanda, we are continuing our efforts in support of judicial reform, human rights observance and the meaningful reintegration of genocide survivors and returned refugees into society.  However, instability in the north-west of Rwanda and the ethnic implications of the conflict in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo are undermining our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlying our approach is a firm recognition of the need for each country in the Great Lakes region to continue to carry out fundamental reform in the areas of democratic transition, human rights, good governance and the rule of law.  This is essential in order to achieve the necessary conditions for lasting stability. Regionally, this will be contingent upon the success <Col N="364" /> achieved in these areas at national level. Ireland will therefore fully support the efforts of the EU, UN, OAU and other members of the international community aimed at ensuring that human rights violations against the innocent civilian population caught in the current conflict are monitored and that those responsible for them are brought to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been following the Middle East peace process very closely and has been heartened by the developments which resulted in the reaching of the recent agreement at Wye, Maryland.  I would like to congratulate all concerned, in particular President Clinton who clearly played a crucial role in the negotiations. The agreement is of the utmost importance as it revives the Oslo process which has been stalled for over 18 months.  It re-establishes the basic principle of the entire process &mdash; the &ldquo;land for peace&rdquo; concept &mdash; which had been laid down at the Madrid conference in 1991.  It addresses in a very detailed manner the key issue of security. It provides for a meeting of donor countries at ministerial level before the end of the year.  There will also be a meeting of the Palestinian National Council which will take place in Gaza and which will revise the Palestinian National Charter. Finally the Wye Agreement opens the door for the final status negotiations which hopefully will lead to the settlement of all outstanding problems between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</P>
      <P>It does not address two other very difficult issues &mdash; the question of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon and the settlement of the Golan Heights issue.  Hopefully, however, it will have brought the resolution of these issues nearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Signing an agreement is one matter, implementing it is another.  A very great deal now depends on the implementation of this agreement. There are onerous obligations accepted by both sides which have to be met within a definite timetable.  I note with some concern that the start of the implementation process has not been as smooth as we would have liked.  In particular, there is the risk of the process being derailed by incidents such as the terrorist attack in Gaza last week.  We condemn all such attacks and violence, whatever the source.  I therefore strongly urge both sides to adhere to the precise terms and the <Col N="365" /> timetable contained in the document to which they both committed themselves.</P>
    <P>From the outset, the EU actively supported the mediation efforts of the United States.  Ambassador Moratinos, who was appointed during the Irish Presidency in 1996 remained in close touch with the two negotiating teams throughout, encouraging them in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>As regards Irish support for the agreement we will, of course, in conjunction with our EU partners do everything we can to encourage both sides to adhere to its terms.  We took particular note of the provisions regarding the international donor conference to which I referred earlier and will play our part when that conference is convened.</P>
    <P>Much of course, remains to be done.  Real negotiations have not yet started on what are known as the final status issues.  These include highly sensitive issues such as refugees, water rights, settlements and the status of Jerusalem. These negotiations will be difficult, but the Wye agreement has given us hope that they will be undertaken in a sense of confidence and mutual respect that did not exist before that agreement was signed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The accession process was launched by the EU member states, the ten central and eastern European countries, and Cyprus on 30 March. Accession negotiations were inaugurated the following day with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Cyprus.  These candidates, known as the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; or the &ldquo;five plus one&rdquo; countries, have now submitted their negotiating positions on at least seven chapters of the Union <i>acquis.</i>  Formal negotiations on these chapters will be launched at Intergovernmental Accession Conferences in Brussels on Tuesday next, 10 November.  Concurrent with this process, the preparation of negotiations with the five other candidate countries known as the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&mdash; Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Bulgaria &mdash; is taking place through intensive screening of their national legislation by the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with our EU partners, Ireland is committed to EU enlargement and considers the opening of accession negotiations as a step forward towards creating a new Europe.  At the <Col N="366" /> General Affairs Council next week, the Commission will present reports on the progress made towards accession by all the candidate countries. Ireland believes that the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council are clear regarding the timetable for accession.  However, we will await the Commission reports on each candidate before considering whether any changes to the accession arrangements are necessary or justified.</P>

      <P>The Communicating Europe Task Force met four times in 1998 to date: on 13 March, 8 May, 2 July and 8 October.  Its next meeting is scheduled for 23 November.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the task force held a fundamental review of its activities and made plans for a multi &mdash; annual project programme.  The task force has taken the view that, in so far as possible, its activities should be focused on reaching the widest possible audience either through its own direct publications or indirectly through the provision of source materials by specialists in European affairs for consumption by a wide audience.</P>
      <P>The activities conducted this year include: continued support for Europe Week, a weekly compilation of reports, suitable for radio broadcast, on events in the European Union which is supplied to all local radio stations; continued support for EuroLink, a weekly compilation of reports, suitable for print media, on events in the European Union which is supplied to local newspapers in the northern half of the country; a decision to support a Euro-Link type project in the southern part of the country in future years; the publication of a poster calendar aimed at school children in 1999, the theme of which will be European Institutions; the publication of fact sheets on Ireland in the European Union, aimed at an adult audience; an ongoing project to publish by mid-1999 a CD ROM on the European Union from an Irish perspective for use in schools and by the wider public; advice on the promotion of the European Union by community groups, and a decision in principle to publish a new edition of the handbook on European funding available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition the task force agreed in 1998: to support the European Awareness Week conference organised by the Irish Countrywomen's Association, in view of its wide and influential rural membership; support the European Movement, Ireland's seminar on Agenda 2000, and a decision to support the publications programme of the Institute of European Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force also has considered a number of other applications for funding which, in its view. would best be supported by pragmatic advice <Col N="367" /> and-or restructuring.  The future work of the task force will be aimed at an inclusive stimulation of debate about Ireland's role in the European Union, the benefits of membership and the future challenges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Afghanistan has become increasingly serious over the past year.  The Taliban faction are now believed to control more than 90 per cent of the total land area of the country.  The Government and the international community in general have been particularly concerned by reports in recent months of massacres of innocent civilians and executions of prisoners of war in Mazar-e-Sharif and elsewhere in northern Afghanistan.  The non-compliance with the basic principles of international law is clearly one of the main causes of an alarming rise in tension in the region in general.</P>
      <P>The European Unions approach to the Afghanistan crisis has been outlined in the Common Position which was adopted on 26 January of this year in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The Union's objectives in relation to Afghanistan continue to be as set out in that Common Position, namely: to bring about a sustainable peace and encourage dialogue between the various Afghan factions; to promote regional stability; to promote respect for human rights; to provide effective humanitarian aid; to reinforce the fight against drugs and terrorism; to assist in peace-building activities.</P>
      <P>In keeping with this Common Position, the European Union has channelled aid through its ECHO programme to the extent of 26.7 million ECU so far this year.  The EU is currently the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Bilaterally, Ireland has contributed this year £100,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance as well as £103,000 to rehabilitation programmes run by non-governmental organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the treatment of women in Afghanistan, the European Union has denounced the continuing discrimination against girls and women.  It has underlined on several occasions that it attaches the highest importance to respect for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It has undertaken to urge the Afghan factions to end discriminatory policies and to recognise, protect and promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women &mdash; including access to education and health facilities, employment outside the home, personal security and freedom from intimidation and harassment.  I have repeatedly joined with my European Union colleagues accordingly in calling upon the Taliban Interim Council and other Afghan factions to respect basic human rights and to prevent gender discrimination in every way possible. <Col N="369" /> I wish to assure Deputies that the Government will continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan closely in co-operation with the relevant international bodies.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland's relations with Turkey are very good and have intensified in recent years.  The Irish Embassy in Rome has been accredited to Turkey since 1979.  The recent decision of the Government to open a new Embassy in Ankara is evidence of a significant strengthening of diplomatic ties between our two countries.</P>
      <P>Our economic relations with Turkey are developing well.  Turkey was Ireland's 29th largest export market in 1997.  Trade in both directions has grown rapidly since the establishment of a customs union with the EU on 1 January 1996. Irish exports to Turkey grew by 54 per cent in 1997 to reach over £120 million.  Ireland's imports from Turkey increased by 28 per cent in 1997 to reach £57.6 million.  Turkey has imported neither beef nor cattle in recent years but, following negotiations with the European Union, the market may be opened in the coming year, thus offering possible opportunities for Irish exporters. Also, a number of Turkish financial institutions have established operations in the IFSC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that following the end of the Cold War, Turkey's size and geographical position straddling continents and cultures mean that it will play an increasingly important economic and political role in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  In this context, Turkey's desire to strengthen its relations with Ireland and other EU member states is welcome. We also welcome Turkey's commitment to pursuing further reforms in the area of human rights and protection of minorities. <Col N="370" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union is convinced that it is in the interests of both the Union and Turkey that their bilateral relations be developed further.  With that aim in view, the EU has been consistently prepared to assist Turkey in the further reform of its political and economic systems.  The EU's relations with Turkey have been on a formal footing for some 35 years, going back to the Ankara Accord of 1963.  The accord provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the implementation of a customs union between the parties, the final stage of which was established on 1 January 1996.  The accompanying financial protocol, however, intended to assist Turkey in restructuring its industry, has been blocked.  In an attempt to redress this situation, the Commission has recently introduced draft regulations which could facilitate the freeing of moneys provided for under the protocol.  Ireland has consistently supported the unblocking of financial assistance to Turkey and is closely examining the Commission's proposals.</P>
      <P>In the wider perspective of its aspirations for Union membership, Turkey's eligibility for accession on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states was confirmed by the European Council in Luxembourg last December. While the political and economic conditions enabling accession negotiations to be envisaged have yet to be attained, the European Council nonetheless considered it important to draw up a strategy to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the European Union in every field. The strategy includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the development of the possibilities afforded by the EC-Turkey Association Agreement, an intensification of the customs union, implementation of financial cooperation and participation by Turkey in certain programmes and agencies.</P>
      <P>The European Council stressed that the consolidation of Turkey's links with the EU depends on that country's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU; respect for and protection of minorities; the establishment of satisfactory and stable relations between Greece and Turkey; the settlement of disputes by legal process, including the International Court of Justice, and support for negotiations under the aegis of the UN on a political settlement in Cyprus on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that Turkey has been unhappy with aspects of the EU's approach and has argued that the Customs Union is viable only in the context of future EU membership.  Turkey has not attended meetings of the European Conference and decided to withdraw from the Association <Col N="371" /> Council meeting, due to have taken place last May.  In order to give fresh momentum to EU-Turkey relations, the EU Heads of State and Government, meeting at the European Council in Cardiff in June, invited the Commission to carry forward the EU strategy for relations with Turkey, with the aim of preparing Turkey for EU membership.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the timely re-affirmation by the Cardiff European Council of the essentially dynamic and inclusive nature of the enlargement process as agreed at Luxembourg.  Turkey is an important partner for the Union, and it is in the fundamental interest of both parties &mdash; the Union and Turkey &mdash; to develop relations more intensively. We believe Turkey will give careful consideration to the steps already taken and explore the potential of the strategy for relations outlined by the European Council.</P>
    <P>I may add that the EU and Turkey are also actively engaged in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership &mdash; commonly referred to as the Barcelona process &mdash; established in November 1995. The process seeks to promote a comprehensive partnership between the EU and its Mediterranean partners, including Turkey.  It aims to progressively transform the region into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity.  Ireland attaches great importance to the Barcelona process and is committed to ensuring its success.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.</P>
      <P>Transfers of prisoners, including republican prisoners, to this jurisdiction are governed by the terms of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which both Britain and Ireland have ratified.</P>
      <P>Five republican prisoners were transferred to this jurisdiction under the terms of this Convention in the period November 1996 to 1997.  Four were repatriated from Britain and one from the United States of America.</P>
      <P>Since November 1997, 17 republican prisoners have been transferred from Britain to this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>There are currently six convicted republican prisoners in Britain.  Five of them have requested transfer to this jurisdiction, and the remaining prisoner has not yet made a transfer application.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, gives effect to the provisions of the European convention in this jurisdiction.

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that implementation of the Act is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the Minister to expedite the transfer of the republican prisoners who have requested it, and I understand there are ongoing contacts with the Home Office with a view to facilitating this.  I am hopeful that further transfers will take place soon.  The Government attaches the highest priority to this issue.</P>

      <P>An informal meeting of EU Heads of State or Government took place at Portschach in Austria on 24 and 25 October 1998.  Ministers for Foreign Affairs were not present at this informal meeting.</P>
      <P>I understand that discussion focused on a number of issues of current importance on the EU agenda including external security matters.  British Prime Minister Blair, at the invitation of the Austrian Chancellor, introduced a discussion on enhancing the effectiveness of the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the face of crises such as Kosovo, particularly if and when the United States does not wish to be fully engaged.  I understand a discussion ensued which focused on the need to enhance the EU's capacity to act in peacekeeping and crisis management, against the background of institutional developments such as the arrangements set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, under which the EU can use the Western European Union to undertake the Petersberg Tasks.  The discussion also focused on NATO's evolving role as an instrument and resource for peacekeeping and crisis management, and on emerging arrangements within NATO which may facilitate European capacity to act in the peacekeeping and crisis management areas.</P>
      <P>No institutional proposals were made at the discussion.  Several partners underlined the prime importance of political will in managing and resolving crises such as Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in contributing to the discussion, recalled with some other speakers that the Amsterdam Treaty, which some partners have not yet ratified, provides potential to act together more effectively on the external front, including in peacekeeping and crisis management. The Taoiseach commented that the EU <Col N="373" /> should seek to use the treaty's provisions to the best effect.  The Taoiseach also drew attention to the importance of ensuring unity of purpose and approach among the member states of the EU, which is a necessary condition for an effective Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Questions Nos. 181 and 182 on Tuesday, 3 November 1998 I outlined the circumstances under which new passports were not issued to Irish citizens for emigration to Southern Rhodesia nor to those of our citizens residing in Southern Rhodesia during the period 29 May 1968 to 21 December 1979 when mandatory UN sanctions were imposed on the illegal regime there.  Since those restrictions were lifted, people who were affected have been able to avail of Irish passport facilities in the same way as Irish citizens generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has since provided the Passport Office with the name of the person on whose behalf these questions were asked.  Passport Office records indicate that he was one of those to whom new passports were refused during the period the UN sanctions were in force and who was entitled to avail of passport facilities once the sanctions were lifted.</P>
      <P>If the person in question wishes to apply for a new Irish passport he may do so by submitting a completed passport application to the Passport Office in Cork, which deals with applications from persons residing in Munster.</P>

      <P>The stand-off at Drumcree regrettably continues despite the efforts of a number of parties to resolve the dispute.  The death of RUC Constable Frank O'Reilly last month underlines in a most tragic way the need to act with restraint and within the law at all times.  Confrontation and the perpetuation of conflict over this parade is contrary to the real interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department continue to monitor the situation and are in contact with parties involved in order to encourage dialogue and a way forward.  Mutual respect and mutual accommodation remain the only way of resolving this conflict.  The continuing protest heightens tensions locally and retards the prospect for eventual agreement.  As I have stated from the outset, in the absence of local agreement, the Government will continue to urge that the rule of law must be respected by all sides and that it must be upheld rigorously.</P>

      <P>Since its inception, the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has played a very constructive role in improving relations and understanding between parliamentarians on both sides of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement proposes the establishment of a British-Irish Council to bring together the Irish and British Governments, the new devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and the Isle of Man and Channel Islands.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is becoming increasingly concerned at the situation in Iraq both regarding the destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction under UN supervision and the welfare of the Iraqi people.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 the United Nations Security Council, by resolution 687 of April 1991, authorised the setting up of a special UN Commission, UNSCOM, to oversee the disarmament and destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the nuclear, biological and chemical areas.  While much work has been done in the nuclear area, marked reluctance by Iraq to comply with the terms of resolution 687, as well as the other resolutions passed by the Security Council, has led to a series of crises between Iraq and the Council.  Earlier this year the UN Secretary General, Mr. Koffi Annan, defused the most serious of these situations when he reached agreement with the Iraqi government which resulted in UNSCOM continuing its work subject to certain changes in the modalities of its inspections.  Shortly after that the Security Council, in its resolution 1154, stressed that any violation of this agreement or the previous UN resolutions would have the severest consequences for Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 August, however, Iraq announced that it had decided to suspend co-operation with UNSCOM again.  On 9 September, following a series of meetings with Iraqi officials, the Security Council agreed to a further resolution &mdash; 1191 &mdash; which condemned the latest decision by Iraq.  The council called on Iraq to rescind that decision and announced that it would not now conduct the <Col N="376" /> comprehensive review of the sanctions regime established by the UN Security Council which was scheduled for October 1998 until that decision was formally rescinded.</P>
    <P>However, the council continued to work on the terms of reference for such a review and reached agreement on these terms last week.  Nevertheless, on 31 October, the Iraqi National Revolutionary Council announced that it was ending all co-operation with UNSCOM with immediate effect and made it clear that it expected all UNSCOM personnel to leave Iraq.  The Security Council met the same day and issued a statement which declared that Iraq's decision was a flagrant violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the February agreement with the UN Secretary General.  It demanded that Iraq rescind its latest decision and resume immediate, complete and unconditional co-operation with UNSCOM.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on this matter is quite clear.  We fully support the Security Council in demanding full compliance by the Government of Iraq with the terms of its resolutions and we call on them to reconsider their position.  Their compliance with those resolutions will make it possible for the entire issue of sanctions against Iraq to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that these sanctions are having a very serious effect on the welfare of the Iraqi people and in particular of Iraqi women and children. According to figures supplied by UNICEF infant mortality rates have increased from 61 to 92 per 1,000 live births in the period 1990 to 1996. Statistics relating to other health issues such as nutritional levels reveal similar shocking situations.</P>
    <P>The international community has demonstrated its concern at this situation.  In 1995 the UN Security Council passed resolution 986 initiating a food for aid programme under which Iraq was permitted to export certain qualities of oil and to use the income so earned to pay for food and medical supplies.  These supplies were to be distributed under UN supervision.  In February of this year the Council doubled the value of the oil which Iraq was permitted to export &mdash; to $5.2 billion every six months.</P>
    <P>In a report to the Security Council in September, the UN Secretary-General estimated the oil revenues for the current phase to be approximately $2.86 billion, providing $1.79 billion for the humanitarian programme.  With a current higher level of production and recent stability in the price of oil, the United Nations officials advised that the revenue expected during the current 180 day period from 30 May to 25 November could be around £3.3 billion.  This would provide $2.178 billion for the humanitarian programme. This is still one billion dollars less than needed to fund fully the enhanced distribution plan approved by the Secretary-General last May and shows that much work still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is not currently a member of the Security Council, I have made our serious concern known to those of our EU partners who are <Col N="377" /> members of that body.  I will continue to press for the alleviation of the plight of the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>The situation in Iraq is monitored on an ongoing basis in the framework of the EU's common foreign and security policy.  However, the General Affairs Council has not considered the issue recently pending the outcome of the developments in the Security Council which I have described.</P>
    <P>I have noted the media reports regarding the resignation of the United Nations Co-ordinator of Humanitarian Relief in Iraq.  However, it would not be proper for me to comment on the alleged reasons for the resignation of any official of the United National Organisation which is a matter between the person concerned and his or her superiors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 54, 82 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Algeria continues to give the Government the most serious cause for concern. The civil war is continuing and further massacres of innocent civilians, including women and children, are taking place.  There are repeated reports regarding violations of basic human rights mentioned in the Report of the Panel of Eminent Persons set up by the UN Secretary-General and that of the UN Human Rights Committee, both of which appeared in September and which I have received and read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has now been complicated by the recent announcement of President Zeroual's resignation which comes into effect next April. Although the President has not fully explained <Col N="378" /> the reasons for his resignation, reports suggest that they may reflect an intensifying debate between reformist and conservative circles regarding the waging of the civil war and implementation of the economic reform process.  Tension has recently been increased by new restrictions on the media.  Those political parties which agree on the need for change now face new challenges.</P>
    <P>The internal situation in Algeria, and in particular the human rights dimension, was raised with the Algerian Foreign Minister at a meeting with the Troika, at ministerial level, in Vienna on 21 October.  The Troika expressed the EU's deep concern about the killing in Algeria and reiterated the need for full respect for human rights.  It repeated its earlier demand that Algeria should now accept visits by UN special rapporteurs on extra-judicial killings and torture.</P>
    <P>The Algerian Foreign Minister indicated that his Government believed in universal human rights norms and did not use the security situation in their country as an excuse for abusing such rights.  While Algeria was prepared to work with the UN Human Rights Committee, they were not prepared to accept special rapporteurs, claiming that their involvement was not justified.  He was prepared, however, to consider any information which the EU provided on individual cases.  The EU will now consider how best to follow up on this meeting.</P>
    <P>As regards action at the United Nations General Assembly no motion on the Algerian situation has yet been tabled.  If one is proposed I will consider its terms positively.  Developments in Algeria will be considered in debate in the Third Committee of the General Assembly and will be addressed by the European Union in its statement. In the light of the outcome of that debate, I will further consider the possibility of co-sponsoring a resolution on the issue.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I will encourage, by every means available, improvement in the human rights situation of the Algerian people.</P>

      <P>Good progress continues to be made in giving practical expression to the declaration adopted by Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers in Barcelona on 27-28 November 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Barcelona Declaration established a comprehensive and balanced partnership between the EU and Mediterranean partner countries, through strengthened and regular political dialogue, the development of economic and financial co-operation and greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension.  Underpinning the declaration is the EU's willingness to join with <Col N="379" /> the Mediterranean countries in transforming their region into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The most recent Euro-Mediterranean meeting at Foreign Minister level was held in Palermo on 3-4 June 1998.  Sustained by a strong political will to revitalise the process, the Palermo meeting was widely considered to be a success.  The shared assessment is that Palermo has helped to rejuvenate the Barcelona process, the momentum of which was faltering as a result of difficulties encountered in the Middle East peace negotiations.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the state of progress in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, account needs to be taken of the very broad scope of the activities involved.  These deal with political and security issues, economic and financial questions, as well as social, cultural and human affairs.  Some of the key partnership elements are as follows: 1.  Political and Security aspects &mdash; the EU and Mediterranean sides have been working in partnership to prepare outline headings for a possible Stability Charter for the Mediterranean region.  Discussions are still at the stage of identifying possible topics which might be included among the draft headings.  The next round of discussions, which will be attended by representatives from the 15 EU member states and the 12 Mediterranean partners, will take place in Brussels later this month; 2.  Economic aspects &mdash; target date of 2010 has been set for the creation of a free trade area for the Mediterranean region.  This will entail the conclusion by the EU of association agreements with individual partner countries of the region.  To date, association agreements have been concluded with Tunisia, Morocco, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority; 3.  Financial aspects &mdash; the MEDA Regulation provides for an amount of 3.42 billion ECU by way of financial co-operation with Mediterranean partners.</P>
    <P>The Palermo meeting has helped to prepare the ground for the next formal foreign ministerial meeting, which will take place in Stuttgart on 15-16 April 1999.  Regular preparatory discussions are continuing in the Euro-Mediterranean Committee and will intensify as the Stuttgart meeting approaches.  While the agenda for the meeting has yet to be finalised, the major themes are likely to be the impact of the association agreements in the context of the global economic situation, and the strengthening of co-operation between the two regions.</P>
    <P>The Barcelona process is a unique and valuable undertaking, embracing as it does all 15 EU member states and 12 Mediterranean partners. Together with its EU partners, Ireland remains fully committed to the process and is contributing actively to the task of advancing it in concrete and practical ways.</P>

      <P>On 19 and 20 October last I made a very useful bilateral visit to Greece at the invitation of Foreign Minister Pangalos.  During the course of my visit we had wide-ranging discussions covering a number of bilateral, EU-related and topical international issues.  Our discussions included the important question of Cyprus and specifically the prospects for progress being made towards a settlement in the light of the UN Secretary-Generals recent initiative.</P>
      <P>At the end of September last the Secretary General had meetings in New York with President Clerides of Cyprus and Mr. Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriot community.  The Secretary General proposed that his Deputy Special Representative, Dame Ann Hercus, should develop a process of contacts on the island with both parties with the goal of reducing tensions and promoting progress towards a just and lasting settlement.  Both leaders expressed their support for the process and promised to co-operate in a constructive and flexible manner.  On 16 October last, Dame Hercus launched her confidential shuttle talks with President Clerides and Mr. Denktash.  The Secretary General will report on the process to the Security Council in December.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with Greece and other EU partners, fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a political solution to the Cyprus question based on a bi-communal, bizonal federal approach.  In this regard we have offered every support to the renewed efforts of the Secretary Generals Deputy Special Representative.</P>
      <P>We also hope that the opening of EU accession negotiations with Cyprus will provide both an incentive and an opportunity for serious efforts to find a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question.  Along with the majority of our EU partners, we would wish to see a united Cyprus accede to the Union.  As recommended by the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, the Government of Cyprus issued an invitation to the Turkish-Cypriot community to participate in the Cypriot delegation for accession negotiations.  Although this invitation has, to date, been declined, it is hoped that continued efforts and sufficient political will can enable an acceptable formula to be found.  Ireland strongly believes that membership of the EU will provide both communities on the island not only clear benefits in economic development but also safeguards on security, and respect for the rights of each community.</P>

      <P>I am greatly concerned at the continuing abuse of the human rights of the Burmese people by the military regime currently in power in Rangoon and in particular by the recent incidents involving the freedom of movement of the National League for Democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. In my statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations last September, I drew attention to the human rights situation in Burma and urged the need for international action.</P>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to Burma is based on the Common Position adopted by the European Union in October 1996.  The Common Position stresses the Union's profound concern at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma, including the restrictions imposed on fundamental rights of freedom such as speech, movement and assembly.  It also imposes various restrictions on the military regime in Burma and urges the regime to restore democracy without delay and to respect human rights.  The Common Position was renewed for a further six months last week at the General Affairs Council which was held in Luxembourg. I argued strongly on that occasion for increased sanctions to be imposed on the regime and I am pleased to inform the House that the Common Position was strengthened through a widening of the visa ban by explicitly including transit visas under the current ban and its extension to cover Burmese authorities in the tourism sector.  I have indicated to our EU partners our support for the further strengthening and broadening of EU sanctions to include aspects of trade and investment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that Ireland supported the adoption of a resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar last April at the 54th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  This resolution expressed the concern of the international community at the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar and called upon the Government of Myanmar to guarantee an end to violations of the right to life and the integrity of the human being and to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to work for an improvement of the human rights situation in Burma and to assist the democratic movement in that country. <Col N="382" /></P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council has not discussed matters relating to Sellafield over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed extension of activities at Sellafield, the UK Environment Agency recently announced its proposed decision concerning the commissioning and operation of the mixed oxide, MOX, fuel fabrication plant. The agency has referred its proposed decision to the UK Ministers for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for their consideration as to whether they wish to direct the agency to make a different decision or to issue further policy guidance to the agency.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, has responsibility for matters concerning energy and nuclear safety. Deputy Jacob chairs the ministerial committee on nuclear safety, which takes a particular interest in Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jacob has availed of every opportunity to bring to the attention of the UK authorities the Government's concerns about Sellafield.  In the context of two periods of consultation undertaken by the UK Environment Agency during 1997 and 1998 in regard to the proposed MOX plant, his Department made two submissions to the agency detailing the Government's opposition to the proposed plant.  In the light of the agency's recent decision, Deputy Jacob has written to the relevant UK Ministers reiterating the Government's opposition to the proposed MOX plant and requesting that they rescind the agency's proposed decision.</P>

      <P>The article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 20 September 1998, which I assume gave rise to this question, does not mention any shortcomings with regard to accommodation or educational facilities for Irish teenagers selected for trials by English football clubs.  The embassy in London maintains close contact with numerous voluntary groups in the Irish community in Britain who offer advice and support to Irish people, including young people newly arrived from Ireland.  Neither the Department of Foreign Affairs nor the embassy has received any complaint in regard to the accommodation or educational facilities provided to Irish teenagers selected for trials by English football clubs.  If the Deputy lets me have details of any shortcomings with regard to accommodation and education which may have come to his attention I will consider whether it would be appropriate for the Department or the embassy to take any action.</P>

      <P>On 12 September this year, representatives of some 20 bodies from the Basque country met in what was called the Ireland Forum and issued a statement known as the Declaration of Lizarra. The Ireland Forum included representatives of the PNV, the moderate Basque nationalist party which leads the Basque country regional government, and Herri Batasuna, the political party closest to ETA.  The purpose of the declaration was to set out a framework for a comprehensive dialogue aimed at resolution of the Basque question, which would include ETA.  The declaration was made in the perspective of a forthcoming ETA truce, which would allow transition to a definitive phase of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 September, ETA announced its first ever ceasefire beginning on 18 September.  The ceasefire was described as total and indefinite. ETA said that it would not hand over arms but would retain them for defensive purposes.  ETA also said that the Declaration of Lizarra opened the door for Basque society to take the initiative in determining its future.  ETA favours breaking the Basque country links with Spain and France and concentrating political forces to achieve a unique and sovereign institution for the whole of the Basque country.  The initial reaction of the Spanish Government was cautious.  Prime Minister Aznar gave the announcement a guarded <Col N="384" /> welcome and said that ETA could not be readily given the benefit of the doubt.  The Spanish Government was determined to continue working for peace and he initiated a series of consultations with all democratic parties with a view to drawing up a common position.</P>
    <P>On 2 October, Prime Minister Aznar announced the conditions under which the Spanish Government would enter a peace process in which Herri Batasuna and ETA could participate. The process of dialogue would involve the State and those who have abandoned violence and would lead to the discussion of political questions among elected political representatives.  The Government indicated that, if ETA truce continued, it would be prepared to talk to Herri Batasuna. However, ETA had to demonstrate a clear will to put an end to violence and unequivocal actions to promote this conviction including respect for the Basque elections of 25 October. The Government envisaged introducing a new policy of consensus, flexibility and a dynamic in regard to prisoner release which would evolve as peace became more assured.</P>
    <P>The results of the Basque regional elections on 25 October were a gain for Euskal Herritarrok, which represented for all practical purposes, the replacement of Herri Batasuna, and also for the Popular Party headed by Prime Minister Aznar. The moderate Basque nationalist party, the PNV, continues to be the largest party; the second largest party is the Popular Party while the third is Euskal Herritarrok.  At the present time, there are negotiations among the parties on the formation of the new Basque regional government.</P>
    <P>Against the background of a continuing cease-fire and in the light of the Basque election outcome, Prime Minister Aznar announced on 3 November the setting up of contacts with those close to ETA with a view to establishing ETA's willingness to open a peace process involving the definitive abandoning of weapons.  These contacts have been described by official sources as &ldquo;exploratory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government naturally supports efforts to secure peace.  We would hope that the peace process in Ireland can be a source of inspiration to all.</P>

      <P>The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1994.  The adoption of the Convention reflected the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against UN and associated personnel. <Col N="385" /> Attacks against, or other mistreatment of, personnel who act on behalf of the UN are unjustifiable and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The current international position is that the Convention is not yet in force and will not enter into force until 30 days after the deposit with the UN Secretary-General of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession of 22 countries.  As of October 1998, there were 43 signatories and 20 states parties to the Convention. Given that the Convention remained open for signature only until 31 December 1995, Ireland is not now in a position to sign the Convention.  In order to become party to the Convention, Ireland will have to proceed by way of accession.</P>
      <P>It is clear from an examination of the terms of the Convention that domestic legislative measures will have to be enacted in order to give effect to the provisions of the Convention in Irish law.  I assure the House that, once the legislation has been put in place, there will be no delay on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs in taking the appropriate steps to lodge Ireland's instrument of accession.</P>

      <P>I have been following closely developments in the Islamic Republic of Iran since the election of President Khatami last year.  Many of these have been positive &mdash; for example an increase in the democratic process, greater transparency in government and a marked emphasis on the importance of the rule of law.  The recent announcement by the Government of the Islamic Republic regarding the case of Salman Rushdie is very welcome.  However, I still remain concerned at certain aspects of the human rights situation in that country, especially in the case of the Bahai community, and will be pursuing this matter, in conjunction with our EU partners, at the current session of the UN General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These internal developments have been <Col N="386" /> matched by a growth of a more pragmatic approach to issues in the foreign policy field. These include a resumption of the dialogue with the EU, the beginning of reconciliation with the US and the ending of the diplomatic isolation of the Islamic Republic <i>vis-a -vis</i> its neighbours in the Gulf region.</P>
    <P>Ireland maintains close and friendly diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic.  I met with Foreign Minister Kharrazzi in New York in September and propose to visit that country in the near future to discuss the further strengthening of our bilateral relations.</P>

      <P>Every year, Amnesty International selects five countries where there is a pattern of persistent, severe and systematic violations of human rights and calls on the international community to address the human rights situation in these countries. The countries highlighted this year were Cambodia, Colombia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  Officials from my Department met representatives of Amnesty International's Irish branch earlier this year to discuss the particular concerns raised by Amnesty and to consider means by which these concerns could be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human rights is a priority issue for this Government and I strongly support the view that the international community has an obligation to act on grave breaches of human rights.  Raising <Col N="387" /> incidents of gross and persistent human rights abuses in international fora is one of a number of approaches which the Government takes to promote and protect fundamental human rights and freedoms.  We believe that applying international pressure through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN, the Council of Europe and the Office for Democratic Institution and Human Rights is one of the most effective means of tackling human rights abuses.  In co-operation with our EU partners, we have on many occasions spoken out against the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in many countries, including those specifically highlighted by Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>At this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU statement on country situations expressed concern at the human rights situation in many countries, including each of those referred to by Amnesty International. In addition to this, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on the human rights situation in Cambodia and participated in an examination of the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, which was examined under the special 1503 procedure, at which only member states of the Commission can participate.</P>
    <P>The Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which deals with human rights matters, is in session.  Once again Ireland, in co-operation with EU partners, will raise human rights abuses worldwide.</P>
    <P>I believe that, wherever possible, human rights concerns should be pursued in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue.  This Government will continue to call on all Governments to co-operate with the various human rights mechanisms of the United Nations, such as the special rapporteurs, the working groups, the special committees and with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  My Department, through our Permanent Mission in Geneva, remains in close contact with the Office of the High Commissioner on all human rights issues.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, through the Human Rights and Democratization line of this Department's overseas development aid budget, we contribute to a broad range of projects aimed at promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in a number of countries, including some of those referred to by the Deputy in his question.  Further information on such projects is available in the annual Irish Aid Report.</P>
    <P>I should also refer to another country which Amnesty subsequently added to its list of priorities for this year, Algeria.  For further information on Algeria, I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 98 which I answered in the Dáil on 20 October last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs is the pursuance of Ireland's foreign policy objectives in the international arena.  In that context, a large number of international agreements, treaties and conventions covering a wide range of subjects fall under the auspices of the Department and it must consider on an ongoing basis the desirability of Ireland signing, or becoming a party to, those agreements which it has not already signed.  It may be that the subject matter of an international agreement relates to the area of work of another Department and that Department's views must be taken into consideration in deciding whether <Col N="389" /> or not Ireland should sign or become a party to the particular international agreement.  In some cases the input of another Department is required before the State can become party to an international agreement &mdash; for example in relation to drafting necessary domestic legislation in order to allow Ireland to fulfil its obligations under such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Given the vast number and range of international agreements, treaties and conventions involved, signature or accession will not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time.  The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.  Ireland is of course generally under no particular obligation to sign or accede to international agreements, treaties and conventions.</P>
      <P>In cases where it is proposed that Ireland would sign or become a party to a particular agreement, it may not always be possible to state when that will happen.  In advance of the Sate becoming a party to an agreement, its provisions may require careful consideration, in particular to assess whether there are any constitutional implications and to determine whether domestic legislation is required to enable the State to fulfil its obligations upon becoming a party to the relevant convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration at a given time, this should not be taken to mean that <Col N="390" /> signature or accession at some stage in the future has been ruled out.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a query concerning Ireland's position with regard to a particular international agreement, treaty or convention which Ireland has not signed or become a party to, he might point this out to me and I will provide him with the information he requires.</P>

      <P>During my visit to the People's Republic of China last February, I urged the then Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Qian Qichen, to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama without preconditions as the best means of protecting the human rights of the Tibetan people and of achieving a peaceful settlement to the issue of Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made the same request when he had a lengthy discussion with the Chinese Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji, in Beijing on 14 September. The Taoiseach's address to the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing later in his official visit provided an opportunity to put his views on the public record.</P>
      <P>The Government holds both the person and office of the Dalai Lama in the highest regard and considers him to be a significant force for moderation given the present circumstances which exist in Tibet.  His Holiness is always welcome to visit Ireland whenever he might wish to come here.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to Questions Nos. 66 and 132 on Tuesday, 3 November 1998.</P>
      <P>On 6 November 1997 I stated in the House that I had requested the competition and mergers review group, a body established by my predecessor to review the corpus of competition law, to examine how certain competition recommendations pertaining to newspapers might be enacted into law and to report back to me.  The chairman of the group expects to publish a discussion document on this issue shortly.  The final overall report and recommendations of the group including its recommendations on legislation will be considered by me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry which reported in June 1996 contained many recommendations, a number of which concerned competition and which related to my Department as follows: &mdash; that a ban be placed on the sale of newspapers at below average marginal cost, that, in exercising powers to control changes in ownership of newspapers, the Minister should take into account the following factors &mdash; the competitiveness of the industry, the plurality of newspaper ownership, the plurality of titles, the diversity of views in Irish society and the maintenance of cultural diversity; that consideration be given to amending merger legislation to widen the powers to regulate not only the acquisition of shares <Col N="392" /> but also the acquisition of control over newspapers by other means; that issues of concentration in the media should be considered on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
    <P>As regards the first recommendation, the National Newspapers of Ireland have been informed that this issue was examined by the previous Minister and independent legal and economic advice was sought on this difficult issue.  I also considered it but considerable difficulty has been encountered in attempting to formulate in law a mechanism which would be effective and workable while at the same time being in compliance with European Union law.  I have decided to concentrate on the other competition recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry and these are the subject of the review groups deliberations.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to realising the full potential of oil and gas resources offshore Ireland.  The Government's policy objectives are being pursued through the licensing of competent operators to explore for oil and gas in Irish waters.  This strategy is underpinned by taxation and licensing terms which are competitive in international terms having regard to comparative prospectivity.</P>
      <P>In relation to the use of any oil reserves which may be found the position is that the sale of any petroleum produced by the holder of an authorisation issued by my Department would be a matter for the operator concerned.  The 1992 licensing terms provide that all petroleum produced shall be sold by, and payment made to, a person resident in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have urged the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators to give Irish suppliers of goods and services and indeed Irish workers the opportunity to participate in offshore activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>A more detailed statement of policy and strategy for this sector may be found in my Department's Strategy Statement.  I am arranging for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>To ensure fair procedures and the adherence to principles of natural justice, the draft report into the investigation was subject to vetting by the Office of the Attorney General.

The report will be published as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I regret that progress in having this and indeed other marine casualty reports published has been slower than I would like.  However, as I have previously indicated, I will shortly bring proposals to Government to address the recommendations in the report of the policy review group on Investigation of Marine Casualties.  The key proposal is the establishment of a new statutory marine casualty investigation board with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to expeditiously publish reports of the board's findings.</P>

      <P>Ireland's input into the development of the common <Col N="394" /> foreign and security policy is considerable. Currently this is focused on three aspects of the CFSP which arise in the context of the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which is expected to come into force early next year.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides for a revision and systemisation of decision-making under the CFSP.  The role of the European Council in defining principles and general guidelines, which was already provided for in the Treaty of Maastricht, will be highlighted to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>Under the new Treaty of Amsterdam provisions, the European Council will decide on common strategies in selected areas where the member states have important interests in common and the General Affairs Council will recommend and implement such strategies.  Treaty provisions allow for decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy to be adopted by majority vote, subject to safeguards &mdash; the so-called emergency brake.  It is envisaged that a common strategy will be adopted by the European Council by unanimity in the customary way, and that it will provide a more or less detailed outline of policy objectives on the basis of which subsequent implementing decisions could be adopted.</P>
      <P>Discussions are taking place at senior official level among partners with a view to the Vienna European Council in December agreeing on a list of topics for the first common strategies to be adopted under the Treaty of Amsterdam, probably at the Cologne European Council in June 1998.  Ireland is participating in and contributing to these discussions.  The Amsterdam Treaty also provides for two related institutional changes to the operation of the CFSP.</P>
      <P>The High Representative-Secretary General of the Council will have responsibility for assisting the Presidency in representing the Union on CFSP issues and contributing to policy formulation. The Cardiff European Council in June decided to appoint the High Representative at the Vienna European Council in December.  It has been agreed that the High Representative will have a political rather than civil service background. The Austrian Presidency has taken up a suggestion of mine and indicated that it will conduct bilateral discussions with partners with a view to submitting a name to the Vienna European Council in December.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides for the establishment of the policy planning and early warning unit.  It is intended to provide the Presidency and the council with timely assessments of situations and to produce argued policy option papers to be presented by the Presidency to the council as a contribution to policy formulation.  The Western European Union Secretariat will have a presence in this unit.  Ireland has been involved in the discussions on the preparations for the establishment of the unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the admission of a limited number of Hungarian refugees in the 1950s, Ireland has responded to particular international humanitarian crises by admitting a number of different groups of refugees. These groups include, as stated, Hungarians in the 1950s, Iranian Baha'is in 1985, Vietnamese in the 1980s and Bosnians in the 1990s.  Decisions to admit such groups, known as programme refugees, are taken by Government usually in response to appeals from international agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
      <P>The main groups of programme refugees at present in Ireland are the Vietnamese and the Bosnians.  In 1979, 212 Vietnamese refugees were admitted from refugee camps in Hong Kong and Malaysia.  There are 603 Vietnamese living here including 155 children born in Ireland.  This figure also includes relatives who joined family here through the family reunification programme.  Similarly, 178 Bosnian programme refugees arrived in Ireland in September 1992.  The number of Bosnians living in Ireland is 868, including 58 children born here and relatives who have arrived under the family reunification programme.  These figures illustrate the extent to which the family reunification programme has contributed to the integration of both communities.  In this respect, the finding of a recent survey of the Vietnamese and Bosnian communities in Ireland identified the family reunification programme as an important element of resettlement for the refugees.  In addition the survey found that the granting of Irish citizenship is one of the crucial features in a successful resettlement programme.  Programme refugees become eligible to apply for Irish citizenship after three years residence in Ireland.  The majority of the Vietnamese are now Irish citizens. To date, 174 Bosnians have been granted Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>For the past ten years, English language training has been provided for the Vietnamese at the Vietnamese Irish Association Community Centre in Dublin.  These classes are funded by the Department of Education and Science through the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. Language support is provided as required on a peripatetic basis for children attending primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of Bosnian adults have attended English language training at private language schools funded by the Department of Education and Science.  Bosnian children go directly to primary and post-primary schools.  Language support <Col N="396" /> is also provided for these children on a peripatetic basis.</P>
    <P>A new EU funded project, Interact Ireland, was established in 1997 on a partnership basis between the Refugee Agency, FÁS, Trinity College and refugee NGOs.  This project works in close co-operation with the Department of Education and Science in co-ordinating progress for refugees from language training courses through supported vocational training into employment and self-sufficiency.</P>
    <P>The Bosnian and Vietnamese refugee communities have both established their own community associations &mdash; the Bosnian Community Development Project and the Vietnamese Irish Association.  These bodies organise social and cultural events and activities and provide support and assistance in the resettlement process.</P>
    <P>The overall policy of the Government is to support the integration into Irish society of programme refugees in a manner that strengthens their independence and allows them to make a positive contribution to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 togeher.</P>
      <P>In 1998 Ireland has provided emergency assistance totalling £1.4 million to Sudan.  This year's assistance is a continuation of our consistent support to the international humanitarian relief effort through the UN and Irish and international NGOs.</P>
      <P>During my visit to Sudan in August it was obvious that, in order to avert a famine, a large volume of humanitarian assistance will need to be provided for at least the next 12 months.  The Government will continue to exert pressure on the relevant parties to ensure that they will maintain adequate humanitarian access over such time as proves necessary to protect the people of south Sudan.  A technical mission from the Department of Foreign Affairs is currently in the region to monitor the impact of resources given so far this year and to plan for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the provision of humanitarian assistance must take place alongside constructive moves towards a political dialogue leading to a negotiated settlement.  During my visit to the region in August I discussed this issue with both sides in Sudan and with the regional IGAD peace <Col N="397" /> initiative through its Kenyan chair.  The Government will continue to work with all the relevant parties within the region, and of course within the EU and the UN, with regard to political progress and humanitarian access.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners welcome the progress made by the regime of General Abubakar towards restoring democracy in Nigeria.  In this context, I particularly welcome the establishment of a new electoral commission which has already issued guidelines on the registration of political parties and a detailed timetable for elections early next year.  We are also encouraged by the release of a large number of political prisoners including the &ldquo;Ogoni 20&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The EU has been reviewing its position in light of these developments.  This has resulted in the recent agreement of a new common position by the Union.  This includes among its provisions the lifting of visa restrictions and the suspension of high level visits.  The new common position, which came into effect on 1 November 1998 and is subject for review prior to 1 June 1999, also facilitates dialogue on EU development co-operation with Nigeria, with a view to its resumption following the installation of a duly elected democratic Government.  The existing EU arms embargo is similarly being maintained pending the implementation of democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and the broader international community to encourage General Abubakar to implement the necessary political reform needed to achieve an early return to democratic government in Nigeria, with full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners have been closely monitoring the situation in Eritrea.  We are particularly concerned about the impact of the current border dispute between it and Ethiopia. The initial border clashes caused several hundred casualties and resulted in the displacement of local populations.  There are also reports of human rights abuses by both countries against people of neighbouring origin.  Humanitarian <Col N="398" /> needs on both sides have been met by a combination of local community resources, national, church, NGO and government institutions with international support.</P>
      <P>As part of its continuing efforts to prevent a resumption of the border conflict the European Union has made a number of demarches to the Governments in Addis Ababa and Asmara. These have urged both parties to find a peaceful solution under the auspices of the OAU.  In doing so they pointed out the negative implications and consequences of a re-escalation of the conflict. The EU also raised the question of the overall humanitarian situation and urged both Governments to adhere to international humanitarian law and to accepted human rights standards.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners strongly support the OAU initiative to resolve the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict.  We also fully support UN Security Council Resolution 1177 (1998) condemning the use of force in this dispute and the UN Secretary General's call for both sides to exercise restraint and do nothing that would endanger the present de facto cease-fire.  At the same time the Union is continuing its efforts in support of full respect for human rights and the rule of law throughout Eritrea.</P>

      <P>The Government remain seriously concerned about the situation in Rwanda which is still recovering from the impact of the appalling 1994 genocide, the subsequent return of over 1.2 million refugees and insurgency by Hutu militias in the north-west.  We are particularly concerned about the impact on Rwanda of the conflict in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo which has serious ethnic and security implications. Along with our EU partners, we attach great importance to the success of current efforts by regional leaders to resolve that conflict which has embroiled a number of neighbouring states and threatens the stability of the entire Great Lakes Region.  This conflict also has the propensity to undo any progress which has been made towards national reintegration and reconciliation in Rwanda with the support of Ireland and other members of the international donor community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to an oral question on a related issue today, I outlined how full human rights observance and the rule of law continue to be a core objective of the Government's policy in relation to Rwanda and, by extension, the other countries of the Great Lakes Region.  We fully recognise that the situation in these countries is far from satisfactory.  This recognition is reflected in the Union's ongoing contacts with the Government <Col N="399" /> of Rwanda and the continuing efforts of the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, to resolve the current crisis. Because of the shared ethnicity of the countries concerned and the legacy of genocide which pervades Rwanda and the other countries of the Great Lakes Region, continued focus must be maintained on the reform of both national and regional structures.  Progress in Rwanda will have a direct impact on the potential for real progress at regional level as will failure in that country.</P>
    <P>The Government and our EU and UN partners will continue our efforts to resolve the current situation in Rwanda.  These will continue to focus <i>inter alia</i> on full human rights observance and the creation of improved and transparent mechanisms for human rights accountability.</P>

      <P>Ireland's contributions to international multilateral aid programmes take the form of mandatory and voluntary contributions.  In 1997, a total of £43.242 million was channelled through multilateral development assistance agencies, equal to 35 per cent of Irish aid expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the United Nations, voluntary contributions to a range of UN organisations totalled <Col N="400" /> £7.5 million in 1997 and are likely to be £8.43 million in 1998.  The three main recipients &mdash; the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) &mdash; operate in most developing countries.  For example, UNDP covers 174 countries through a network of 134 country offices.  In addition, Ireland makes mandatory payments to the World Bank Group, UNIDO, Global Environment Facility and UN Environment Programme as well as a range of mandatory and voluntary contributions to UN agricultural and food agencies.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid bilateral programme also makes specific voluntary contributions to UN Programmes on an emergency basis or to support particular programmes or projects.  In respect of the EU, 21 per cent of Irish aid funding was channelled through the EU in 1997.  The main direct development expenditure in 1997 was £4.928 million to the European Development Fund, EDF, as part of the Lomé Convention.  The EDF has programmes in the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that are party to the Lomé Convention. In addition, some £20.82 million of Ireland's contribution to the EU budget went to fund development co-operation.  This would be used to fund a wide range of aid operations in Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean region, eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.  In summary, Ireland supports through the UN, EU, World Bank, and other multilateral institutions a range of programmes &mdash; involving mandatory or voluntary contributions &mdash; in virtually every developing country.</P>

      <P>While no specific schemes of financial assistance are operated by my Department, grant aid amounting to £380,000 has been paid to a number of animal-welfare bodies including a total <Col N="401" /> of £200,000 paid to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals since September 1995.  As the payment of such aid is invariably an end-of-year exercise depending on the resources available out of the Department's Vote, I am not in a position to guarantee the continuation of such assistance.  I will, however, consider any further requests for aid from the Society in the light of any resources available to me later in 1998 and having regard to any competing claims for grant assistance which may be submitted by other welfare bodies.</P>

      <P>The position regarding payments made under the 1996 BSE compensation package to the person named has been reviewed.  He was paid BSE top-up amounting to £515.20 in respect of 23 animals eligible under the 1995 suckler cow scheme.  He had no eligible animals for payment under the 1996 suckler cow scheme.  Article 2 of EU Regulation 1357/96 requires that money paid to farmers who had fewer eligible animals for payment under the 1996 suckler cow and 1996 special beef premium schemes must be refunded. Regrettably, I have no discretion to waive the EU Regulations requirement to repay money outstanding.</P>

      <P>I received a submission about a year ago from the Irish Butchers Asssociation for assistance to upgrade small abattoirs in order to comply with new regulations being introduced to comply fully with the hygiene requirements of Council Directive 91/497/EEC and Council Directive 95/23/EC.  These regulations came into operation in February of this year.  It was not possible to provide financial aid from resources available to my Department.  Standard operating procedures were, however, drawn up to ensure that any costs involved for small abattoirs slaughtering <Col N="404" /> less than six livestock units per week will be minimised.</P>
      <P>I recently received a submission from the Craft Butchers of Ireland who are requesting inclusion for financial assistance in the new Structural Funds for the year 2000-2006.  This matter is currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the cost to the Irish taxpayer brought about by the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in 1985; if the moneys involved have been paid in full; if not, the portion paid by Allied Irish Banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22252/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>The Exchequer advanced an interest-free loan of £32 million to the administrator of Icarom plc in 1993 following the conclusion of an agreement with AIB in 1992 for additional funding of the Icarom administration.  The £32 million loan is repayable in 2012.  Under the 1992 agreement AIB makes an annual contribution of £8.8 million to Icarom over the 20 years to 2012.  This contribution <Col N="405" /> is in addition to the annual contribution of £5.5 million which AIB makes under the 1985 funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the £32 million interest-free loan advanced in 1993 and repayable in 2012 is represented by the interest forgone which is estimated to amount to £2.1 million annually.  This is a continuing cost until the loan is repaid and is the only cost borne by the Exchequer in respect of the funding arrangements for the Icarom administration.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the net present value (NPV) of the costs of the funding arrangements now in place for the Icarom administration, i.e. the sum of all past and known future payments to the Administrator, is £357 million in 1998 terms.  It is estimated that 56 per cent of this cost is borne by AIB, 8 per cent by the other banks, 27 per cent by Ernst &amp; Whinney (former auditors of ICI) and 9 per cent by the Exchequer.  The Exchequer share of this cost would be less than the figure indicated if the Exchequer loan of £32 million were repaid at a date earlier than the scheduled repayment date of 2012.  Therefore, the final cost to the Exchequer cannot be determined until the administration is completed.</P>

      <Col N="409" /> Control of infectious diseases is the statutory responsibility of health boards, which are required to make arrangements for the diagnosis and treatment of persons with such diseases in their functional area.</P>
    <P>The Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, which is at present reviewing the guidelines on immunisation published in 1996, is considering the issue of appropriate vaccination policy to prevent transmission of infectious diseases, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B. I understand that the committee expects to finalise the revised guidelines shortly.  In addition a multi-institutional study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population has recently commenced and the results of this study will assist in determining whether additional measures are required in relation to prevention of this disease.</P>

    <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.  The objective of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95 per cent.  My Department has established an immunisation advisory group, which is considering a range of issues concerning the operation of the programme, with a view to maximising uptake amongst the target population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated to the House, I am aware that there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health boards. This difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas, particularly in the Eastern Health Board.  Arising from the additional funding approved by the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998 the board has appointed three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of applicants who wish to adopt children abroad.  I understand that the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is nine months: a reduction of five months on 1997.  This reduction can be accounted for by the allocation of additional resources and to greater efficiencies in the overall process of application.</P>
      <P>I have received a large volume of representations concerning both delays in commencing assessments and perceived differences between health boards in the assessment process itself.  I am not convinced that simply assigning more social workers to deal with an ever expanding case load is the most efficient way of dealing with this situation, particularly when one considers the other areas of pressing need in our child care services. It is also necessary to consider how health boards can best utilise existing resources to manage cases and whether or not legislative change is required to assist them in this regard.  I therefore announced on 30 September last my intention to commission an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services.  The terms of reference of the consultancy are as follows: (i) to review the current assessment procedures in health boards in consultation with relevant interests (this review should encompass both social work practice and service management); (ii) to provide an overview of the current assessment procedures in health boards which identifies any particular issues which need to be addressed; (iii) to propose a standardised framework for the carrying out of future assessments which accords with best practice in the field and delivers the service in the most efficient and sensitive manner possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Within this standardised framework, health boards should be able to exercise a degree of flexibility in the management of the service and in the detail of its delivery so that they can adapt it to the particular circumstances prevailing in their functional area; (iv) to estimate the resource implications (on current application rates for assessment) of this proposed standardised framework (this estimate to include staffing levels, management and administrative requirements etc.).  The feasibility of introducing charges for assessments should also be examined in this context; (v) to highlight any areas in which legislative or administrative change would improve the quality of the assessment process.</P>
    <P>It is expected to award the contract for the consultancy later this month.  Any proposals for legislative change arising from the consultancy will be considered in the context of the Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption, 1993 which is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>

Since taking office, this Government has provided an additional £10 million in 1997 and £8.4 million this year.  I am not yet in a position to say what funding will be available in 1999.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to buildings to which the public have access.  Part M of the Building Regulations, which came into operation on 1 June, 1992, deals with access for people with disabilities. Part M applies to the construction of new public buildings; and to extensions of, or works in connection with material alterations to, existing public buildings.  I have issued technical guidance on compliance with Part M which specifies that provision for sanitary accommodation for disabled persons should be made available on the same basis as provision is made for other users of a building; and that, as a minimum, one unisex convenience should be provided in an accessible location in a public building to which wheelchair users have independent access, accompanied or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Under section 2 of the Local Government, (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, An Bord Pleanála has a statutory objective of determining appeals within a four month period.  The continuing growth in the number of appeals, which reflects the upturn in the national economy, has resulted in a fall off in the number of appeals being determined within four months.  At the end of September, 65 per cent of appeals determined in 1998 had been determined within four months and 92 per cent had been determined within six months.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the planning appeal process operates in an efficient and effective manner and to help the board meet its statutory objective of determining appeals within four months, I have taken a number of measures this year.  These include an increase in board membership of 50 per cent and approval to all other additional staffing sought by the board during the year.  Appointments to the outstanding posts are expected to be finalised before the end of the year.  In the light of these measures, I expect the board's performance to steadily improve.  I will continue to monitor the board's performance to see if additional measures are required.</P>

      <P>An application was received from the Erris branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association for inclusion in the community development programme.  The application was for a broad based project in the Belmullet area and not exclusively for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The community development programme (CDP) was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  The programme provides financial assistance and support towards staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities.  An independent technical group was set up to asses applications by individual groups and to advise on selection of new areas for the CDP.  The group's membership is drawn from the CDP projects, support agencies, combat poverty agency, ADM and my Department.  The Department, with the assistance of the technical group, is drawing up a list of 30 priority areas/communities of interest to be targeted for inclusion in the CDP over the next few years, as provided for in Partnership 2000.  The technical group, which examined the application from the Irish Wheelchair Association, Erris, at its October meeting, has agreed to examine the application further in this context.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to announce these priority areas shortly.</P>

      <P>As I announced already, I am introducing a <i>pro rata</i> pension to address the specific issue of this group of self-employed people who having paid into the social insurance <Col N="417" /> fund in good faith found themselves excluded from entitlement through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>The new <i>pro rata</i> pension will be payable to those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed, and who have between five and ten years contributions paid since April 1988.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that up to 10,000 people (8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults) will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of £18 million in a full year.  The total estimated cost of the measure in the future is over £170 million.</P>
      <P>I will announce further details at budget time. Regarding the qualifying conditions for the <i>pro rata</i> old age (contributory) pension introduced in November 1997, these are designed to insure that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify.  A reduced yearly average of ten contributions qualifies a person for payment at 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  The measure is aimed at people such as those quoted by the Deputy who &ldquo;worked in and out of the social insurance system over their working lives&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I consider these existing qualifying conditions to be reasonable and I do not have any plans to amend them along the lines proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of revocation of a certificate of naturalisation is concerned, the position is that section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, provides that a certificate of naturalisation can be revoked in certain defined circumstances.  These include where the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances, or where the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
      <P>I have the option of considering any case in the light of this section and in that respect I am considering the information disclosed in a recent television programme to see what action is open to me.</P>
      <P>In so far as the level of investment in the State as a result of the investment linked naturalisation scheme is concerned, records in my Department indicate that total investment was in excess of £90 million</P>

      <P>The period of time spent analysing and determining the type of illegal substances found on suspects in the Dublin metro-politan area varies widely according to the nature of the case.  For instance, the Deputy will be aware of a number of major seizures in Dublin last weekend, when the forensic analysis was completed and the report written by last Sunday night.  At the other end of the scale, for instance, a request made for analysis of minute traces from a suspect's pocket, which might not have any evidential value, but which may be required for Garda record purposes, would receive very little priority and may take weeks, even months, to complete.  In this context, an &ldquo;average&rdquo; delay, if it could be worked out scientifically, would be seriously misleading if it were to lead people to believe that all cases were to take such time. <Col N="421" /> In view of the increasing number of cases dealt with by the laboratory the staffing requirements are regularly reviewed by my Department.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have become aware, in recent weeks, of the increased presence of known drug abusers in the area.  The Garda believe that the increase is as a direct result of intensive Garda activity under Operation Dóchas in neighbouring areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that when the problem came to their attention, they immediately targeted the area by introducing Operation Cleanstreet, which has resulted in at least ten detections under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, that is, possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply since 18 September 1998.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the area will continue to be monitored by local units and the Garda national drugs unit.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda that there is no provision for the installation of a CCTV system in this area at this time.</P>

      <P>During the period 1 January to 30 September 1997, my Department provided financial assistance to the Irish Refugee Council for a legal project which provided advice to asylum seekers at the first stage of the asylum process. The Irish Refugee Council withdrew from the scheme with effect from 1 October 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the provision of a refugee legal service my Department provides £120, plus VAT per case in legal aid for asylum seekers to present their cases to the appeals authority.  This amount is paid to the legal representatives, who are <Col N="423" /> engaged independently by asylum seekers, on certification by the appeals authority that the representatives have acted in the case.</P>
    <P>In April 1998 my Department sought tenders from persons interested in establishing and maintaining an independent refugee legal service. Such a service will provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers in connection with their asylum applications.  Five tenders were received and following the detailed evaluation process conducted by a committee comprising one representative each from my Department, the office of the Attorney General and the UNHCR it was recommended that the tender process be abandoned and no contract awarded. I have accepted this recommendation and further options are being considered.  It is hoped to finalise arrangements shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department funds the courts building programme which enables court-houses to be refurbished throughout the country in conjunction with local authorities which act as agents.  Refurbishment projects are prioritised on the basis of certain criteria, including office locations, the number of sittings, caseload, etc. On this basis the venues located in county towns are getting priority as they usually accommodate the District and Circuit Courts and the High Court on Circuit and the offices of the District and Circuit Courts.  On this basis, the old Model School in Cork was refurbished to accommodate the District Court and major refurbishment work is under way on the courthouse in Washington Street.  Work will begin shortly on the refurbishment of Mallow courthouse, which accommodates the staff of the District Court office.</P>
      <P>I understand minor improvement works were recently carried out at Macroom courthouse, mainly to the judge's chamber.  Macroom courthouse will be fully refurbished as part of the courts building programme and, while it is at the planning stage, it is not possible to say when this work will be undertaken.  I am committed to providing modern court facilities in the area in question as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 492 weekly man hours expended to provide a dedicated Garda response to monitoring CCTV systems.  The related weekly wage cost is £4,920.  Using the Department of Finance staff cost model, this sum would be multiplied by a factor of two, since it includes items such as training, accommodation, pension costs, PRSI and equipment, etc.</P>
      <P>The monitoring facilities for the Garda CCTV systems are located in O'Connell Street and Pearse Street stations in Dublin, and also in Tralee Garda station.  In addition, gardaí monitor traffic during peak periods at the Dublin Corporation civic offices.</P>

      <P>In my view, the key factor in the concept of CCTV monitoring is that the placing of CCTV systems acts as an overt deterrent to criminals.  It also assists in allaying the fears of the community in relation to crime in the areas where such systems operate.  CCTV systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing Garda resources.  In this respect, CCTV may be of assistance in the detection of crime and the identification of suspects.</P>
      <P>The cost factor involved in terms of initial outlay, upkeep of equipment and the employment of personnel to act as monitors means that the concept of CCTV systems must be kept under continual review to ensure their cost effectiveness.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received 26 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems, including an application from Castlebar. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing. They are as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin south central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The remaining applications, including Castlebar, are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit. Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective levels of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.  The commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at present.</P>
      <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera.  I understand the Castlebar Chamber of Commerce has given some indication that local interests would be willing to fund the capital cost of the entire system, although I have no information as to whether the necessary funds have been collected.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Garda authorities for an assessment of the operational, maintenance and other implications of proceeding with such a system.</P>

      <P>The enactment of by-laws in relation to the creation of taxi ranks is a matter reserved to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and I have no direct function in the matter. The approval of the Attorney General is also required.  However, I have made inquiries of the Garda Commissioner into the progress on the making of appointed stands (street service vehicles by-laws) in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to Athlone, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner, in accordance with agreed procedures, forwarded a copy of the draft by-laws to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in November, 1997 for their observations, prior to submitting them to the Attorney General for his approval.</P>
      <P>I understand that following a number of amendments, recommended by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Garda authorities are amending the appointed stands in consultation with Westmeath County Council.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the question of making Appointed Stands By-laws for Mullingar is being taken up with Westmeath County Council by the divisional officer at Mullingar.</P>

      <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the existing sports capital programme, operated by my Department, was Wednesday, 11 February 1998.  It is understood that an application for funding from the organisation in question was originally made to the Department of Health and Children and was forwarded to this Department on 11 September 1998.  The application was, however, received after the closing date, and too late for consideration <Col N="430" /> in the context of the 1998 round of grant allocations.  The organisation in question were informed accordingly by my Department on 15 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme is currently under review by my Department.  When the review is completed, which I expect will be towards the end of 1998, details of the revised schemes will be widely published and it will be open to the organisation in question to apply for funding under the new schemes.</P>

A recommended classroom size of 600 square feet (or 15 square feet per pupil) was specified in &ldquo;The Rules for National Schools&rdquo; published in 1965.

      <P>In the 1997-98 school year, one teacher schools needed a minimum enrolment of 25 pupils before a second teaching post could be sanctioned.  With effect from 1 September 1998, I have reduced this figure to 18.  As a result, 25 one teacher schools have been allowed a second teaching post from the start of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the 1997-98 school year, the retention figure for the second teaching post was 23.  By reducing this figure to 18 from 1 September 1998 a total of 28 schools continue to operate in the 1998-99 school year as two teacher units.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have allowed 14 schools which had enrolments below 18 pupils, to continue as two teacher units for the current school year.  In total, therefore, 67 schools have benefited from my initiatives in support of one teacher schools.</P>
      <P>In the course of the current school year, I will continue to examine a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to the remaining one teacher schools, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  There are ten such schools in County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of complaints concerning management issues at Carndonagh community school.  These complaints related to the level of financial accountability to the board and the accuracy of returns of pupil enrolments submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>Community schools are established under a deed of trust and managed by an 11 member board of management separate from my Department. The board comprises three representatives of the religious communities, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two parent and two teacher representatives.  The principal teacher of the school is a non voting member of the board of management.  My Department is not represented on the board.  Each board is responsible for the governance and direction of the school and for the procedures in place to inform board members concerning the affairs of the school.  My Department provides guidance to boards in relation to school management generally and it also supports initiatives taken by the representative management body for boards &mdash; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &mdash; in this regard so as to ensure that best practice obtains.  Where internal board difficulties arise, these fall to be dealt with by the board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The complaints received concerning Carndonagh community school were referred to the board of management for its consideration and report to the Department.  The board responded stating that it was satisfied with the accountability arrangements in place at the school and that all relevant information had been made available to board members.</P>
      <P>In March 1995 the school informed my Department of an error in the return of enrolments submitted for 1994-95 which resulted in an over-statement of pupils attending the school.  This error was the result of inadequate checking of the return before it was submitted to my Department. The board was reminded of its obligations to ensure that such returns are accurate and complete. Roll keeping procedures have been reviewed on a number of occasions since then and my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of pupil returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's internal audit unit visited the school in May 1996 to examine its operation and procedures and prepared a report on its findings. The board of management was requested to consider the report and outline the measures being taken to address weaknesses identified in the school's systems.  Following two further visits in 1997, the internal audit unit confirmed that progress was being made in upgrading procedures at <Col N="436" /> the school but further work was required in a number of areas.  Outside accounting expertise was also sanctioned for the school.</P>
    <P>My Department has also met with members of the board in 1997 and 1998 and outlined to them the board's responsibilities for the overall management of the school and the need for improved procedures. Guidance has been given to the board in relation to good management practice generally.</P>
    <P>The complaints made did not refer to any impropriety on the part of the school management and my Department's inquiries have not uncovered any evidence in this regard.  The school has co-operated fully with my Department's inquiries and the board has undertaken to accept and implement the internal audit unit's recommendations.  However, a number of issues remain to be resolved and my Department will continue to monitor progress at the school in consultation with the board of management.</P>

      <P>In May of this year I announced the provision of £15 million in direct grant-aid to schools for the purchase of computers under the Technology Integration Initiative of Schools IT 2000. All schools in the free education system received grants as follows:</P>
      <P>Ordinary Schools: A basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil.</P>
      <P>Special Schools: A basic grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
      <P>All ordinary schools with one or more special classes received an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.  I have also made provision for a special allocation of £250,000 to provide ICT hardware for individual children with special needs in mainstream classes,</P>
      <P>Under the Telecom Éireann information age schools initiative, every school in the State has received a multimedia Internet-ready computer. Telecom Éireann has provided a total of 4,200 computers under this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware that, in many cases, the grant provided by my Department has been added to significantly by local groups, companies and businesses. It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of computers acquired by schools to date as some schools are still in the process <Col N="438" /> of purchasing ICT equipment from the grant-aid provided.  However, taking all of these factors into account, I would estimate that there will be at the very least 15,000 additional computers in our schools by the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>In October the Higher Education Authority, as a first step, allocated £29,092 to the college specifically for the purchase of computers.  In addition, the college has received a further allocation of £259,000 to meet refurbishment costs associated with the increased student intake for 1998-99.  A further allocation of £210,000 to meet other costs, including computers, associated with the increased student intake has also been sanctioned for the college.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The general position is that arrears of salary, pension and lump sum are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement.  The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.  My Department's plan to complete the work of paying the arrears by September of this year was based on the required temporary staff being in place in the spring.  It was not possible, however, to appoint them until June, following protracted negotiations with staff unions.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, the pace of the work has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding super-annuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering phone queries between 10 a.m. and 12 noon in the case of secondary teachers and between 2.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. in the case of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before Christmas.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due by Christmas, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>
      <P>The position in the case of the retired teacher referred to by the Deputy is that arrears of salary have been paid and arrears of pension and lump sum are being prepared.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  However, I understand that the person in question is seeking financial assistance <Col N="441" /> towards the cost of education at a fee-paying second level school recognised by my Department.</P>
      <P>All fee charging schools receive teacher allocations from my Department in accordance with the normal criteria governing such allocations.  As teacher salaries represent the single most significant item of expenditure by a school, I would hope that the Department's salary grant would be seen as a significant contribution towards the education of pupils attending these schools.</P>
      <P>The overall rationale governing spending in the education area is to make reasonable education provision for all eligible pupils including pupils with special needs.  Generally, where it is considered that adequate provision exists within the free education scheme, my Department does not grant aid attendance at schools outside of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is open to the parents to have the child concerned enrolled in a school in the free education scheme.  My Department can provide assistance in securing a suitable placement if desired.  In addition, arrangements can be made to have the nature of any special needs assessed by my Department's psychological service with a view to making appropriate educational provision in the case.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question was assessed by a psychologist from my Department's psychological service in mid-May 1991. The sole purpose of this assessment was to determine the person's eligibility for special arrangements in the then intermediate certificate examination. The assessment was carried out as a result of an application to the examinations branch of the Department for special arrangements for the particular candidate.</P>
      <P>After carrying out the assessment a recommendation was made to examinations branch, by the psychologist concerned, in accordance with the procedures applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the purpose of the assessment, it is not accepted that an error was made either in the assessment or in implementing the appropriate <Col N="442" /> procedures.  It is considered that the recommendation made by the psychologist was in accordance with the criteria for determining eligibility for special arrangements in the public certificate examinations in respect of candidates having specific learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>No other request was received by the psychological service of my Department, in respect of the student referred to, prior to the application for consideration under the special arrangements in State examinations scheme as it applied at the time.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, one of the student's parents made contact by telephone with the psychologist concerned on a number of occasions in order to discuss the learning difficulties the student experienced.  During the course of these discussions the psychologist advised that the parent should seek help from a local branch of a voluntary organisation which provided assistance to those having particular learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding, as well, that the post-primary school attended by the student, during the period of the junior cycle, made arrangements to provide additional tuition in order to help with the learning difficulties experienced.  The student ceased to attend school after taking the intermediate certificate examination.  In the course of further correspondence with the Department, the parents were advised to seek assistance from the local adult education organiser.  I consider that appropriate efforts were made to meet the problems as they presented.  My Department reviewed and inquired into the responses made in this particular case over a year ago as a result of continuing correspondence about the matter and considered then that appropriate steps had been taken.  My Department will, however, communicate further and directly with the young person concerned, in order to offer to arrange for vocational guidance.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned so that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service, while at the same time ensuring that vehicles are utilised in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools. This means that pupils are often required to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for <Col N="444" /> some time in the evenings.  Post-primary school transport services are planned so that, as far as possible, travelling and waiting times do not exceed three hours daily, and every effort is made to keep waiting times to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In this case the school bus operates a trip to Kilbeggan and another post-primary centre.  The arrangements for pupils on these services is currently under examination by my Department and Bus Éireann has been requested to provide a detailed report.  The Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
