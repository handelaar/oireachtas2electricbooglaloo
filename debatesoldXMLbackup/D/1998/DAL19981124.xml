      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My speech at the inaugural meeting of the NESF on 12 November 1998 has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In my address I asked the forum to take on a new role in developing policies and programmes to tackle long-term unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  Under its new mandate, the forum has a unique contribution to make in evaluating the effectiveness of policies which are being implemented within the framework of the social partnership agreements and in the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum's work will be complementary to that which I have asked the NESC to undertake in preparing a new strategy as a basis for social partnership in the next decade and beyond.  The Government will rely heavily in the next period on their advice and evaluation of measures which are in place to combat poverty and exclusion and <Col N="182" /> I assured the forum of the Government's continued support in their valuable work.</P>
    <P>On the question of staffing, the outgoing forum had completed its work with the publication of its report No. 16, &ldquo;A Framework for Partnership&rdquo;, in December 1997.  Accordingly, the staff whose secondment contracts had expired returned to their parent organisations with the exception of the director who has continued in the meantime. The director has access to the staff of my Department in which he is currently located to support him in his work.  Now that the new forum has been given its mandate, approval has recently been given for appointment to an upgraded post of assistant director and a policy analyst and the appointment of an executive secretary.</P>
    <P>Both organisations will soon work side by side in a new building which has been acquired for them in South Frederick Street.  The Centre for Management and Organisational Development in the Department of Finance has been asked to examine the scope for sharing administrative support services between the NESC and the NESF and to make recommendations on the matter.  In the light of this report, which is expected shortly, the administrative staffing for the forum will be finalised.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the forum's evaluation process will be carried out by project teams constituted from the social partners, relevant Government Departments and agencies and independent experts as appropriate.  The team approach will require the information and expertise of public representatives, social partners, and consumers of services at local level to establish the impact of policies and programmes and to identify the scope for policy improvement.  To assist the teams it is envisaged that project leaders will be required for assignments to provide special skills and expertise.  Project secretaries may also be needed from time to time for particular assignments.  These short-term staff may be recruited on contracts or assigned on loan from other agencies and organisations depending on the topics selected by the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the staff arrangements.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees that it would be impossible for such a body to function with just one member of staff.  Is the Taoiseach aware of reports that members of the voluntary sector in the forum are complaining about what they perceive as negativity on the part of the various departmental secretaries who are also members of the forum, and that a dialogue of the deaf seems to be taking place between both sets of members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was at the first meeting and I can see there are different perspectives.  It will take some time for it to settle down.  The departmental secretaries bring with them the short and medium term difficulties they have while the organisations representing the social community pillar want to see active and far more lively <Col N="183" /> responses.  The increase in size of the forum is a change and it will take some time for members to come to an understanding of their different perspectives.  I hope members will quickly settle down to work jointly on the issues of unemployment, exclusion and poverty which are their agenda items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage the possibility of an economic and social forum of this nature taking on a North-South dimension and involving members of the equivalent organisations from Northern Ireland participating in the work of an all-Ireland forum on such topics?  Is that something that might be considered as part of the range of North-South institutions currently under consideration to bring the third sector, as well as the State and private sectors into North-South co-operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was raised by some of the community and voluntary pillars in the summer.  There is a reference to it which is not well expanded on in the British-Irish Agreement. They have asked that it be expanded.  I originally thought it could be represented in the civil forum but as Deputy Bruton said it is envisaged that it be represented as it is here.  I cannot recall in what section it is contained in the Agreement but it was pointed out that a North-South group could work on this together.  Some people in the Department of Foreign Affairs have co-ordinated an expansion of that section in the document to see how this would work.  It is likely we will be able to respond positively to what Deputy Bruton has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the staffing arrangements and the additional staffing provided for the forum to be in place particularly the secretarial back-up which will be necessary if the members of the forum are to carry out their functions?  What role will the secretaries general of the various Departments play on the forum?  Will they work to an agenda set by Government, their ministerial bosses or act in a purely departmental role, advising on the operations of departmental schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the back-up secretarial staff from my Department are already in place.  That may not be the long-term solution.  I am not sure if that arrangement will work, having been associated with the department in South Frederick Street.  It is not one I am enamoured of. I have asked that that issue be looked at.  Some of the posts are being advertised.  There is a new executive assistant.  Some of the other posts, an assistant director, a policy analyst and a further executive secretary, are in the process of being filled.  I hope that by Christmas those posts will be filled.</P>

      <P>What is the role of the secretaries general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect everyone will play a constructive part and not merely represent the body from which they came.  They should all work on the agenda to deal with the problems.  Secretaries general have the benefit of being able to make a positive input to the NESF, because they have been working on these issues and will be able to explain the departmental view.  I do not wish them to give merely a departmental view but to have a positive input.  The secretaries general have immense experience and knowledge.  In working side by side and in collaboration with the community and voluntary pillar they should help to move the agenda forward.  Rather than reports going back and forward, they should be able to do that on the spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if he does not want the role of the secretaries general to be merely a departmental one, but also a substantial and responsible role, they cannot play that role unless they have a clear political mandate from the Ministers in question?  Does the Taoiseach intend to submit guidelines to the NESF on the development of strategies in these areas?  In the absence of such guidelines, does he accept the NESF runs the risk of becoming a talking shop?  Surely it is the Government's role to lead and the role of the secretaries general to have a mandate which includes a political responsibility that is accountable to this House.  It should then be the role of the NESF to flesh out the problems associated with the implementation of such a strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for that reason I went to the first meeting, addressed the issues and spelt out my view of the mandate.  Deputy Quinn would agree that might have to be said more than once, but I made it clear at the first meeting.  I genuinely want people to work on the issues involved, such as unemployment and social exclusion, rather than seeing the obstacles and difficulties involved.  I am pleased with the initial response.  It took at least nine months to get the NESC and the NESF going because there were difficulties with the representative groups in deciding who should be represented.  I have had discussions of this sort a number of times during the year, and I have been assured by people that they will be positive.  I take the point that Ministers need to reflect that, and I have said so to my Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has a lot of experience in Government Departments.  An assurance from a secretary general that he or she intends to play a positive role is not worth the paper on which it is written because he or she has a legal responsibility to carry out the instructions of Ministers.  Unless secretaries general have a clear <Col N="185" /> political mandate from the Government, what the Taoiseach has said is tantamount to nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also has a fair amount of political knowledge, and he knows that secretaries general play very constructive roles on many boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Always on the political instruction of their respective Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case they have been told by their respective Ministers to participate actively in the NESF, as they do in the NESC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In writing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in writing.  They are not schoolchildren.  They are eminently qualified and experienced.  They know how to play a positive role, or a blocking one if they so wish&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is their natural role if they do not have political instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined my position at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 3, I am thinking of Dublin villages, such as Crumlin, Rialto, Dolphin's Barn, Inchicore, Kilmainham, Terenure and, dare I mention them, Phibsboro, Stoneybatter and Chapelizod.  Did the Taoiseach raise with the NESC the need to restore those villages as a millennium project with a view to improving their economies?  If he has not raised that matter, will he undertake to do so at his next meeting with the NESC?  It is clear the villages of Dublin need major investment and upgrading if they are to be restored to their former glory for the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not within the presentation I made.  A large number of Oireachtas Members are part of the NESF and would be able to make their views known.  Finding a strategy for the next decade is an interesting concept.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On Friday last I met David Trimble at Government Buildings.  It was a very positive meeting. We focused primarily on North-South matters and made substantial progress.  We are hopeful that over the next ten days to two weeks we should be able to conclude these matters so that all the institutions envisaged in the British-Irish Agreement can be up and running by next February, as originally intended.</P>
      <P>I will be meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair over the next two days during his historic visit here, in the course of which he will address a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition to matters relating to Northern Ireland, I also propose to raise with Prime Minister Blair the likely issues to be discussed at the Vienna European Council.  Prime Minister Blair will be meeting with Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria on Wednesday morning just before travelling to Ireland and I hope he will be in a position to brief me on the outcome of that meeting. The issues most likely to arise for discussion in this respect are Agenda 2000, employment, institutional reform and enlargement.  I will be meeting with Federal Chancellor Klima on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>In my meeting last week with United States Senator Connie Mack, we had a general discussion on the current situation in Northern Ireland and the Senator's visit there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to a positive extent, no. While there has been a good deal of background work in this regard, I cannot report anything positive from it.  The International Body on Decommissioning has endeavoured to move ahead with its workload.  It has talked to the parties involved in detail, but I cannot report to the House on the way they are trying to construct their work in this regard.  I do not have that information.  I purposely did not contact the chairman in the past few weeks, but he is actively trying to talk to all the parties involved.  It would be wrong to give the impression I have information from those talks that is leading somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the <Col N="187" /> episode concerning the cancellation of the Donegal Celtic match, where there seemed to be a degree of intimidation of a community and a soccer club that had taken a democratic decision, creates problems in regard to the perception of the way power might be used and, therefore, causes additional fears to centre around the availability of arms to organisations that might want to use power in a selective way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton said, it is unfortunate that club was put under pressure and it created a difficulty for it.  The club was aware of the fixture and had qualified for the next round of a knock-out competition.  It was aware of the sensitivities involved.  It held a democratic meeting and made a decision on what it wanted to do. I am concerned about the question of intimidation, about which there is no doubt.  Everyone must be allowed freedom of action to make their own choices, but that did not happen in this case. It is unfortunate that a sporting occasion has given rise to such difficulty.  We all recognise the tensions and difficulties in Northern Ireland will take time to resolve and there are sensitivities on all sides, but that reinforces the need for us all to work together to realise the vision at the heart of the British-Irish Agreement.  I was glad a club was able to return to its homeground after 29 years to play the Cliftonville-Linfield match this weekend. That was more positive than what we heard the previous weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Taoiseach's meeting with the First Minister designate, David Trimble, last Friday, did he inform David Trimble that it was his view that the movement towards a united Ireland has an irresistible dynamic and, if so, did Mr. Trimble express any views on the longevity of the life expectancy of the Taoiseach in office or on that dynamic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss that with him last Friday, but I gave him my view on this several times and he gave me his.  Needless to say we do not share the same view.  I stated that many times. During the debate on the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution I stated:</P>
      <P>The new position is more in keeping with our dignity as a people.  The people of Northern Ireland have the freedom to choose.  A majority may, indeed, some time in the future decide to become part of a united Ireland. None of us can pre-empt what decisions will be taken by the people in the future and it is they, not us, who will decide if the present Agreement is to be a transition to a united Ireland on the basis of a continuation of the Union.  For our part, we can work to make such unity as attractive a proposition as possible by developing our economy, improving our society in every way, including its pluralism and respect of diversity of identities and traditions on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> I have repeated that many times and it is a longer-term view.  It is not the issue of the day and during his visits to Northern Ireland Prime Minister Blair states clearly his view on the Union and its longevity.  I state my views on it when I am asked.  I try not to do it too often but when I am asked I do and will never apologise for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach quoted from his contribution to the debate on the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  Does he consider that the quotation, which is elegantly phrased prose, constitutes an &ldquo;irresistible dynamic&rdquo;?  If it does so in his own words, does he believe that perhaps that poses a threat to the principle of consent written into the constitutional amendment that was signed off in the British-Irish Agreement on 22 May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the words &ldquo;irresistible dynamic&rdquo; were not mine.  As the Deputy is aware, I did not say that.  The principle of consent governs everything.  Constitutional change or a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> established by the Agreement will depend on consent and peaceful persuasion.  I also said that last Sunday.  I say every time that we have accepted a new situation where the driving force for the future is consent and that will never change.</P>
      <P>The future is in the hands of the people and there will be no imposition, coercion or double dealing in that.  The fear is gone and I believe that in a rapidly changing world the barriers are coming down.  Many of the reasons for maintaining partition in the past no longer exist and that will grow as time goes on.  However, I accept that other people have different views and we do not need to dwell too much on this now.  The important factor is that the Agreement works properly and for its own sake and to a large extent the future will take care of itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it, given that the Taoiseach said the words were not his, that he disagrees with them and does not believe that there is an &ldquo;irresistible dynamic&rdquo; but, on the contrary, there is the principle of consent which will take its own time and place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that either.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Deputy an explanation, as I did last weekend when I was asked my view several times.  Regarding Northern Ireland I am regularly asked my view locally and <Col N="189" /> internationally on the long-term prospects of a united Ireland, which is my political party's long-term ambition.  Of course the principle of consent governs everything in future.  There is no longer any issue of threats.  In the spirit of the last number of years, in the fundamental working of the entire peace process whether it is the Downing Street Declaration, the Framework Document or the British-Irish Agreement, Nationalists and republicans are as entitled as Unionists to express freely their long-term constitutional aspirations.  I am sure the Deputy would allow people to hold that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were not my words.  I can only answer in this House for what I said.  I cannot answer for other people's words and when I am asked a question I put it in the context of the reply.  The reply is as I have given today but I defend very staunchly in this House the claim that the Nationalist viewpoint cannot be suppressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe anybody in this House would argue for any point of view to be suppressed.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is desirable for the Taoiseach of the day to be conscious of the process in which he is engaged on behalf of the people of this State in trying to ensure that the British-Irish Agreement is implemented in full, and that he must bear in mind that there is an alternative Nationalist view, Unionist Nationalists, who currently are extremely nervous about what they perceive to be a possible dynamic within the agreement towards a united Ireland, and that words the Taoiseach might use which might reinforce that fear ought to be avoided?  Would he agree, therefore, that the British-Irish Agreement is neutral as to the outcome in the present or in the future as regards a united Ireland or the maintenance of the union with Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I would.  The principle of consent governs everything.  What people will do in 15 or 20 years' time is a good question, and we should not be too bothered about it. Equally, Deputy De Rossa would agree that when the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on at least three or four occasions this year came to Northern Ireland and stated his position very strongly on the Union, I did not get too excited about it.  However, when I am asked in an interview to speak not only as Taoiseach but as leader of Fianna Fáil, I am entitled to state the long-term aspiration of my party in the mild terms in which I did.  I do not see that as standing on anyone's corns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that one of the big problems in Northern Ireland is that of suspicion and a fear that there is a hidden agenda?  Does he believe that referring to an irresistible <Col N="190" /> dynamic and to what might happen in ten or 15 years' time, while it may go down well among the audience the Taoiseach is addressing at the time, feeds the suspicion that there is a hidden agenda behind the British-Irish Agreement &mdash; which there is not &mdash; and that notwithstanding the natural obligations the Taoiseach has as a party leader it might be better if he avoided engaging in speculation which could fuel unjustified suspicions in the minds of people who are not yet convinced that the British-Irish Agreement is as good an agreement as it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat myself. There is no doubt that what Deputy Bruton says about fears and suspicions makes sense, but that works two ways.  Members of this House could get exercised every day of the week when reading the letters columns of the newspapers where people express annoyance with us as political leaders because we do not always respond to things that are being said about reforming the RUC and so on.  It is right not to get too excited about these things.  However, when I am asked a question I try to give an intelligent answer to it. The answer I gave the other day, for which I make no apology, was that the whole agreement is based on the principle of consent and if there are people who traditionally felt that the way to achieve things was through the barrel of a gun, that should all be left behind and people should use their energies in a constructive way to pursue their agenda and maybe in time people will see things their way.  That will not happen overnight. I put a period of 15 to 20 years on it.  I cannot say what will happen in 15 to 20 years, but I appreciate that people can have an aspiration.  People have held that aspiration for several hundred years.  One thing I have learned about people in Northern Ireland in my political life is that they like people to be straight.  They do not like people to be underhand or to dodge questions.  However, in this case, the principle of consent governs everything.  That is the Agreement for which I sought support and that is how it will be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that much, if not all, of the Agreement is in the process of being implemented, including the issues of policing, North-South bodies and ministerial positions, and that the only obstacle to these matters coming to fruition is the question of decommissioning? Does the Taoiseach foresee an early resolution of <Col N="191" /> this issue given that the letter which the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, gave to the leader of the Ulster Unionists Party indicated a six month deadline in relation to dealing with the matter? Does the Taoiseach foresee this as the period in which the issue will be brought to a conclusion?</P>

      <P>I hope that before Christmas we will have reached a position where the assembly is up and running.  The various administrative arrangements for it are almost finalised.  A number of details remain to be finalised but work is ongoing in that regard.  The Government is not directly involved in this matter but I am kept informed of developments.</P>
      <P>The executive will move to a composition which will allow proper participation under the d'Hondt system.  This is a matter for Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon but I am aware that substantial progress is being made in that area regarding numbers and designations.  Under the d'Hondt system, it is easy for parties to work out their positions.  I hope the implementation bodies will agree.  Some work remains to be done, but I hope meetings will take place later tonight and matters will be finalised over the next week.  In addition, the general areas of co-operation will be specified.</P>
      <P>In terms of legislation, I hope the human rights Bill will be before the House soon.  Other measures, including the legislation relating to the British-Irish Agreement itself, will be enacted shortly.  Most of the other mechanisms are progressing.  It is hoped that the implementation bodies and the legislation surrounding them will be operational by late February.  This is a tight deadline because we have lost time in reaching this stage.  However, they should be ready for use by the institutions at that time.  Another aspect is the east-west arrangements.  This aspect has not been dealt with, but I do not foresee any difficulties in that regard.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that everything has been incrementally moved forward with the exception of one issue, decommissioning.  I hope people in the cool light of day will realise that is the case.  Substantive progress has been made arising from the work of General de Chastelain with the parties, particularly the Progressive Unionist Party and Sinn Féin.  I hope they will realise that this is the only matter, assuming nothing goes wrong with the other areas I mentioned, holding up the implementation of all the other aspects and stopping people taking up their positions in the executive and their ministerial positions, or whatever title is agreed for them. Something must happen or some measure must be taken to give confidence and allow those issues to proceed.  It would be an entirely unreasonable position for people not to give way and allow the blockage to be removed.</P>

Does he agree that these are being put in jeopardy because of the constant roadblocks which are derailing the timescales set by the two Governments and the major parties in Northern Ireland?

Based on the views of the Attorney General, is legislation being prepared which will provide for the statutory framework which the Attorney General indicated was required to make regulators accountable to the Dáil?

He strongly believes that a new way of dealing with these issues should be found, given that difficulties have been encountered in other countries.  He cited various examples and case histories.</P>
      <P>His principal point is to recognise the valuable role of independent regulators in a modern, developing society and to highlight the need to ensure that we, as elected representatives, uphold the basic principles of democracy and political accountability.  Since he made that speech we have discussed matters with the Ministers involved to build on what he used in the strategy statement of the Department of Public Enterprise.  We have no definite plans yet, but in terms of what he identified as a democratic deficit there is an issue to be addressed.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grants to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications were received.  The regional breakdown of these applications will be made available in a table to be included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year, I recently sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow my Department to assist a large number of people again this year.  The regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications and they expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.  This will continue to apply as it has since the inception of the scheme and the actual amount of the grant will continue to vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands.  I emphasise that no decision has been made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme <Col N="196" /> despite some media reports.  I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July of last year I have spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

Again, I emphasise that I did not in any way change the remit of this scheme.  It was never guaranteed under this scheme that a full 90 per cent would be provided in each case.  That was the way in which this scheme operated last year and the previous one.  I emphasis that since I came into Government 18 months ago, we spent £10 million&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not in accordance with Standing Orders.  I asked a simple question which was how much money would be needed.  Does the Minister accept that £5 million was available in 1997?  Will a small amount of extra money, £1 million or £2 million, be sufficient to allow 90 per cent for 1998?  Why was that money not provided?</P>

      <P>When this scheme started in 1996, when Deputy O'Keeffe's party was in Government, it included £2 million for three years in the MABS, the multi-annual budgeting scheme.  When I came into office I increased the figure, with the consent of the Government, by £3 million.  I increased it by another £3 million this year.  The money the Government of which Deputy O'Keeffe's party was a member allocated to this scheme was grossly insufficient.</P>

      <P>I challenge the Minister on his figures.  He did not allocate an extra £3 million. Does the Minister accept the amount was £5 million in 1997 and £5 million in 1998?  Does he accept it would be reasonable to allow an extra couple of million pounds this year to ensure that the 90 per cent figure will not be cut?  It is impossible for many old people to put up the 30 per cent or 40 per cent which is now demanded because of the way the Minister is administering the scheme. Does he accept this is one of the meanest cuts of all on the part of a Government which is flush with money?  As far as the elderly are concerned, this extra couple of million pounds should be made available.</P>

      <P>These are supposed to be questions.  While Deputy O'Keeffe accused me of doing something in relation to my replies, he is not too bad at it himself.</P>
      <P>As a result of an initiative taken by me to increase the figure of £2 million, which had been provided for in the Estimate, an extra £3 million was given last year and again this year.  The 90 per cent figure in the previous year and in the first year was never an absolute maximum grant to be made available; it was always a maximum potential and not every group got 90 per cent. There was never a guarantee that all groups would get 90 per cent.  This year, as well as last year, some groups have been in some way dissatisfied because they applied for much more than the previous year.</P>

      <P>My Department has been making payments by direct credit to customer bank accounts for a number of years.  The facility know as electronic fund transfer is available across a number of the Department's schemes.  Unfortunately, for operational reasons, it has not been possible to extend the facility to one parent family payment.  Software changes must be made to the computerised payment systems to enable this to be done and other administrative changes are also required.</P>
      <P>The EFT option will, however, be extended to other categories of customers as quickly as the necessary changes can be made allowing for other priority projects.  It is my intention that the option will be offered to lone parents as early as possible in 1999.  In the meantime, a specific card based electronic payment system has been developed by the Department for lone parents, as well as the unemployed, to enable them to avail of the household budgeting facility provided by post offices.  Through this system, customers can have payments in respect of rent, mortgage, electricity and telephone bills deducted from their social welfare allowance each week at their designated post office.  More than 2,000 lone parent customers are now availing of this option.  This facility will continue to be available as an option after the introduction of the more comprehensive electronic funds transfer system for lone parents.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention had been drawn to the fact that family income supplement for the self-employed has been in operation in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland for many years without any difficulty; and the reason this system has not been introduced here.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme was introduced in 1984 with the specific purpose of providing an incentive to low paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.  The problems relating to the scheme were seen at the time as being more acute for employees than for self-employed people.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years, the question of extending the scheme to cover the self-employed, including farmers, has been considered on a number of occasions.  Such consideration would have regard to a range of factors including: the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme to the self-employed; the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes; and, most notably, the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of the wider social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> My Department has now completed revised estimates of the cost of extending the family income supplement to the self-employed. Assuming substantial take-up, it could cost between £70 million and £80 million.  This cost would be in addition to the existing expenditure of some £43 million under the unemployment assistance scheme paid to self-employed people, including smallholders, on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the family credit scheme which operates in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom includes provision for the self-employed.  That scheme differs significantly from the family income supplement scheme in the manner in which the income of the income supplement is calculated.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the question of extending the family income supplement scheme to the self-employed must be considered on its own merits and take account of the factors I have outlined and, in particular, the high costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on 4 February last gave a figure of £30 million, assuming 100 per cent take-up.  Subsequently, on 3 November, he indicated that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were in receipt of the supplement.  Does he accept that his figure of £70 million to £80 million as being a prospective cost is wildly overstated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I will tell the Deputy how it is calculated.  If we were to extend FIS to the self-employed the estimate is that for smallholders in receipt of UA it would cost £5.3 million with 3,400 families involved; for other smallholders and farmers it would cost £24.3 million, involving 12,700 farmers; for self-employed already on UA it would cost £1.9 million and involve 1,300 families; for other self-employed people it would cost £45.1 million involving 20,000 families.  That is a total of £76.6 million involving 36,400 families.</P>
      <P>The overall cost would be in the region of £70 to £80 million as we estimate it.  Even if there was only a 50 per cent take up, it would be half that figure on top of the £43 million paid by the State for UA for the self-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minster accept that the present take-up of family income supplement is less than one in three and that, therefore, the figures he quotes are not applicable?  If we base it on the present take-up the question of extending family income supplement to self-employed becomes a realistic proposition at not too great a cost.</P>
      <P>Does he further accept that there is a major case for the extension of the family income supplement to self-employed farmers, many of whom are living on less than £100 per week, and to small shopkeepers and suppliers of services throughout the State?  There is a case in justice to extend the family income supplement to them and it can be done without breaking the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is such a great case, Deputy O'Keeffe and his party were not successful in having it implemented when in Government, despite the fact that a number of organisations, including the farmers whom he mentioned, raised it in the negotiations for Partnership 2000 but were not successful in having it included.</P>
      <P>One of the issues in the first part of the Deputy's question which was included in Partnership 2000, and was the only reference in it to family income supplement, was that it would be calculated on a net rather than a gross basis.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy, if he is not already aware, that I achieved that in the last budget to such an extent that an estimated extra 7,000 families will benefit from the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>I agree that the take-up of the family income supplement has not been as great as we had anticipated but there is a substantial information campaign in my Department and in organisations such as the INOU and others to entice other low income families into that system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I have met the farmers' organisations on a number of occasions and a number of mechanisms have been discussed in regard to the issue of low income farmers with families.  That matter is being looked at.</P>

Does it not make sense that we should extend it here along the same lines?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Government's key objectives is the establishment of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and the incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country.  In formulating proposals for the 1999 budget, the Government will aim to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With specific regard to increases in social welfare <Col N="202" /> rates, current policy in this area is determined having regard to the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  These commitments include increasing the real value of social welfare payments; increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 by the year 2002, and bringing the lowest rates of payment up to the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1999.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget has already made significant progress in these three areas.  It provided for a general increase of £3 per week for some 560,000 social welfare recipients aged under 66 years, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 6,000 people on reduced rate contributory payments, together with a 3 per cent increase, in general, in the rates for some 144,500 qualified adults.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget provided for a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions.  This was a significant first step towards achieving the commitment in our action programme to increase the rate of old age contributory pension to £100 over the Government's five year term of office.  These increases represent real increases of 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has also been made in relation to bringing the lowest payments up to the Commission on Social Welfare recommended rate.  The 1998 budget increases mean that payments to over 797,900 recipients, representing 93.5 per cent of all recipients, are about or above the minimum recommended rates, while payments to a further 57,000 recipients of short-term social assistance, equating to 6.5 per cent of the total, are still about 3 per cent below the target rate.</P>
    <P>In relation to future increases, a number of factors will have to be taken into account.  It will remain a priority to ensure that the real value of payments will at least be maintained in real terms.  In addition, this Government is committed to raising the old age pension to £100 per week &mdash; a rate of increase expected to significantly exceed inflation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the ESRI is an independent body and that its comments and criticisms can be accepted as being objective?

I had a very long and detailed discussion with the ESRI at my instigation just before it published that document &mdash; which I had no knowledge it was publishing &mdash; to get its views on the issues in regard to low income families.  A number <Col N="203" /> of issues are raised in that report which are very pertinent to the budgetary strategy which I and my Government colleagues will be looking at. However, it is important to point out that the pension increases in the last budget were above both price and wage increases, which is in stark contrast to 1995-7 when pensions did not increase beyond wages, as was suggested at that time.</P>

Will he further accept the ESRI report made it clear that a continuation of that policy trend, with social welfare rates increasing more slowly than average incomes, will see a rise in poverty in coming years?  On that basis, will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the trend established, particularly in the last budget, of favouring the rich over the poor will not be pursued in the forthcoming budget?</P>

However, it acknowledged to me that the increases in the last budget were very significant and went a long way to reducing that discrepancy.  I assure the House and the Deputy that this report will be very much to the fore in the Government's building upon the work we carried out last year, where we gave very substantial increases in social welfare payments which were far in excess of those delivered in previous years.</P>

Will the Minister accept that in the forthcoming budget &mdash; and in any other budgets if the Government manages to hang on to office &mdash; the benefits of growth must be spread more widely throughout the community? In order to prevent the rise in poverty to which the ESRI referred, social welfare increases must rise, not in line with the CPI or inflation but in line with other incomes.  If the Government does not accept that, poverty will increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 44 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grants to voluntary groups and organisations, such as the group adverted to in Deputy Jim Higgins's question, which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year, I recently sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  With this level of funding my Department will be able to assist a large number of people this year, and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing the applications received under the scheme.  They expect to be in a position to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications in due course.</P>
      <P>Although the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the one-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.  This will continue to apply, as it has since the scheme's inception.  I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people this year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that, since I came into office in July last year, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme, as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people <Col N="205" /> and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  My Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how it is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>Given the Minister's reply, the pre budget leaks to the effect that older people would be a priority in the forthcoming budget must be viewed with scepticism.  Is the Minister not embarrassed by this response?</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether it is 90 per cent or 60 per cent &mdash; and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that it will be 90 per cent &mdash; how can the Minister justify the situation that, although it is now only four weeks to the shortest day of the year, not one grant has been allocated by his Department to date and not one alarm system has been installed for the elderly?  Although the winter is the most vulnerable time for elderly people, not a penny has been allocated yet and the year is almost over.  How can the Minister justify that?</P>

      <P>It is difficult enough to sit through Priority Questions without having to sit through one's own.  I am very disappointed at the lack of generosity on the Minister's part in regard to the scheme.  Does he acknowledge that this scheme was introduced in the first instance by the previous Government and was established virtually overnight because of concerns expressed in regard to elderly people, particularly those in rural areas, being at risk of burglary and attack? Does he also accept that the previous Government allocated £2 million in the first and second year of the scheme and that, as there was a change of Government mid-stream, he was spending money allocated by the previous Government?  Will he indicate what number of elderly people have been assisted through this scheme?  What is the average allocation per application for each of the years the scheme has been in operation?  I understand the Minister is proposing a 60 per cent allocation which would be the lowest ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to nail the lie that I am imposing any restriction on the maximum allocation available.  I am aware of groups in my constituency which will be receiving 90 per cent of the amount for which they have applied; these groups have already been informed of this matter. Some groups which have made applications under the scheme will not receive up to 90 per cent of the amount applied for, which is exactly the situation which pertained when the scheme was set up.</P>
      <P>I give Deputy De Rossa full credit for responding so quickly in setting up the scheme when it was pointed out that the tax allowance made available in the then budget was more or less useless to many older people who required security assistance as most of them did not pay tax.  I regard the scheme as a good one and that is why I went to Government on two occasions during the past 18 months to get extra money to meet the need which existed.  Grant applications totalling in the region of £7 million have been received this year.  Last year, a similar situation prevailed where the application value was greater than the amount of money allocated.  However, at the end of the year, we were more than satisfied that the money which was made available was sufficient to meet the needs of the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 36,000 people have been assisted by <Col N="207" /> the scheme and it is estimated that a further 20,000 will be assisted in the coming year as a result of the increased allocation.  I accept that the previous Government allocated £2 million for the first, second and third years of the scheme.  On taking up office, I recognised the need for additional funding and I was happy to secure that. Funding under the scheme has not been cut in spite of what some Members of the Opposition might suggest; if anything, it has been increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a total of £5 million was allocated to the scheme in 1997?  It is ridiculous to speak of the previous Government allocating £2 million for 1998 when it is not even in Government this year.  Does the Minister accept that the £5 million which was spent in 1997 was initially cut back to £2 million this year and subsequently supplemented to bring it up to £5 million?  Does the Minister accept that his Department &mdash; presumably at his behest &mdash; has written to the various organisations involved offering them unsavoury options which put the onus on them to make decisions?  Under one option, it is stated that individuals will be obliged to pay between 30 and 40 per cent of the actual cost and, under another option, that voluntary organisations are obliged to choose the most vulnerable individuals as sufficient money would not be available to cover all applications.  That is quite unfair to the very good voluntary organisations operating in this area.  Is the Minister not behaving like Pontius Pilate when he should be providing the top-up necessary to ensure that the full 90 per cent is available to all applicants?  With so much money in the Exchequer, is the Minister not making the unkindest cut of all as far as vulnerable elderly people are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is somewhat naive if he believes that, in relation to all schemes coming before any Government Department which involve the expenditure of taxpayers' money, people are automatically entitled to a 90 per cent payment.  That is patent nonsense.  It is a Department's job to vet applications to see whether they are valid and necessary; that has been the case previously in regard to this scheme.  The Deputy may have been contacted by an organisation in regard to allocations for this year but I wager that there were other organisations last year and the year before &mdash; when only £2 million had been allocated to the scheme &mdash; which were dissatisfied with the amount of money received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Estimates, Deputy O'Keeffe obviously does not understand the system of multi-annual budgeting.  A Department is obliged to outline an indicative sum of the funding required for schemes such as this on a three year forward basis.  The previous Government outlined a figure of £2 million for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively.  When I took up office last year, I increased the figure to £5 million and have done so again this year.  No cut has occurred and no 60 <Col N="208" /> per figure has been imposed.  If applicants comply with the criteria, they are entitled to receive up to 90 per cent of funding.  However, there is no guarantee that every group will receive that amount.</P>

      <P>The deadline for applications was late May.  As I had initiated a review, which was ongoing at that time, it was felt we should wait until the review had been completed. However, I decided to go to Government after the summer when it became apparent the review would not be completed until some time in the new year.  As an interim measure, I requested that an additional £3 million be allocated to the scheme and the Government consented to the request on the basis that between now and the completion of the review, the manner in which the scheme should operate in the future will be examined.  The scheme is very beneficial to many people and is being delivered through a number of voluntary organisations.  Difficulties have been experienced since the scheme's inception because of the fact it was established so quickly; that is why I decided a review would be useful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>My question has been partly answered by the Minister in the reason he gave for the delays. Recently I was contacted by one scheme which last May sought an allocation towards work amounting to £9,000.  They only received a letter back the other day saying their application would be considered if they decided how many they would apply for on the basis of a figure of £7,000.  Is the Minister satisfied that it is very late to receive a letter in mid-November concerning a scheme which will give peace of mind to the elderly and that it will be hard to put the scheme into operation this winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that for this year only £2 million was included in the Estimates submitted in 1997.  Because of this I found it necessary and was happy to obtain from Government extra funding for the scheme.  I accept that due to the upcoming review there was some delay in making the final decision relating to the £5 million.  However, this was indicated immediately to the regional offices.  My understanding is that regional offices have indicated to groups what their allocation will be.  Groups which are not receiving the 90 per cent sought will have to tailor their measure.  There are groups receiving 90 per cent of what they sought.</P>

      <P>Those who have been looking for assistance towards alarms for the past six or seven months are not interested in what was in the Estimates <Col N="209" /> in previous years.  Billions of pounds are available and in that context I ask the Minister what criteria he is setting for deciding whether an application should receive 60 per cent, 70 per cent or 90 per cent funding, particularly given that elderly people who have to find 20 per cent of the cost must come up with £28?  Does the Minister accept that on the basis of a 60 per cent allocation elderly people will have to find over £100 for the same appliance and that this is totally unacceptable?  He should try to find the money in the context of the Estimates.  What portion of the £5 million, which the Minister referred to time and again, has been expended this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While the amounts in the Estimates may not be of concern to the people involved, they are of concern to me.  I faced a situation where the Estimate submitted under the MABS by the previous Government, of which the Deputy's party was a member, was only £2 million.  I was worried about this and decided to endeavour to get additional resources for the scheme, something I successfully did.  This is why there is much more money in the scheme this year than was anticipated and planned for.</P>
      <P>I do not have information relating to expenditure under the scheme, but the allocations have already been notified to the various regions. There were 940 applications which will involve an estimated 25,518 individuals.  It is important to note that one group alone which perhaps made application to a number of other regions in the country applied for £755,000 in one region, namely, Dublin south.  This was a very significant application and obviously had to be checked given the fact that ultimately this is taxpayers' money.  If a group such as this received 95 per cent of the amount it would leave an awful lot less for groups around the country.  I do not know where the Deputy is getting the figure of 60 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.  My Department has now completed revised Estimates of the cost of extending family income supplement to the self-employed which indicate that such a measure would cost between £70 million and £80 million. This cost is based on a substantial take-up and would be in addition to the existing expenditure of some £43 million under the unemployment assistance scheme paid to self-employed people, including smallholders, on low incomes.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that under existing arrangements, self-employed people, including smallholders, whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance &mdash; UA &mdash; appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA.  In the context of the difficulties facing farmers affected by the recent bad season, a number of initiatives are being introduced to increase access to the scheme by low income farmers.  For instance, farmers already on the scheme are being encouraged to come forward for re-assessment of means; efforts are being made to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers and in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, the means assessment procedure is being reviewed to ensure it takes full account of the recent deterioration in farm incomes.  I understand, however, that there has not been an upsurge in new claims or in requests for reassessments in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I have met with representatives of farming organisations to explore the potential within the social welfare system of providing additional income support to farmers on low incomes.  Any proposals emerging from this process will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who have applied for and received supplementary welfare allowance and special needs payments since 1 August 1998 is 12, at a total cost to date of £1,586.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously when I asked this question I was told that what I am suggesting could not be done because of budgetary implications, a point of view which is seemingly reinforced by the figure of between £70 million and £80 million mentioned in the Minister's reply.  The Government is not willing to put up the money.  I have <Col N="211" /> no wish to grant FIS to all farmers &mdash; it would have to be means assessed so that only those deserving it would receive it.  Does the Minister agree that the unavailability to people, who are self-employed and whose incomes are exceptionally low, of an allowance which is available to everybody else constitutes major discrimination? Will the Minister see to it that the discrimination is eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to farmers on extremely low income, there is a scheme, namely, the smallholders' dole, which is not available to other sections of the community, under which between 7,000 and 8,000 farmers receive £33 million from my Department.  FIS was put in place for good reason, to assist low income employees, and it has been significantly changed over the years.  It is important to note that extension of FIS was not a commitment in Partnership 2000, although the issue of whether FIS should be extended to the self-employed was discussed.  As a result of the difficulties farmers have faced in recent months I have spent quite considerable time examining the issue, meeting with the farming organisations and fleshing out the difficulties in the system.  It is important to point out that 86 per cent of the 900,000 people in receipt of payments every week receive less than £100.  It is worth bearing in mind that a significant number of people on low incomes have no opportunity to top up that income as the self-employed have in some cases.  I can put it no better than my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, who said when questioned on this that it would be very difficult to police an extension of the family income supplement to the self-employed.  That is probably one of the reasons it was not extended over the years.</P>
      <P>I am looking at mechanisms to see whether there is any way in which we can assist low income farm families who are experiencing difficulties.  As a result of the difficulties about six weeks ago, my Department exhorted all those farmers who were in difficulties to make application to have their circumstances reviewed or to make a new application for small farmers' dole. Some 24 applications have been received to date from 1 September 1998, 20 of which have been successful.  The average time taken to process applications from registration to first payment was 19.5 days.</P>

In looking at other options to assist farmers who are genuinely in need as a result of low income, will the Minister ensure any changes he may make to the unemployment assistance scheme will apply equally to all families and not only to self-employed families?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the small farmers' assistance route is not the answer to the problem of the self-employed, particularly farmers, given that only 24 new applications have been received since the scheme was advertised in September?  The figures speak for themselves.  Will the Minister accept that under the social welfare assistance programme a husband, wife and child on an income of £120 per week can top up their income by a total of only £4.90 per week, whereas under the family income supplement the top up would be £52.30 per week?  On that basis will he agree there is a major anomaly and discrimination against low income self-employed?  Will he accept there is an unanswerable case for the extension of the family income supplement to the self-employed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an unanswerable case why did the Deputy not use his influence when in Government to extend FIS as had been requested by the farming organisations and his own political party?  Obviously he did not have influence in Government and that may have something to do with the fact that my predecessor was Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the reason only 24 people made application since 1 September for smallholders' dole, given that it was publicised and people were free to apply, the Deputy may say the scheme is not significant.  Others would interpret it as indicating that the situation is not as bad as made out to be. I am not saying that but it is an interpretation that could be taken from the fact that only 24 people have applied.  I suggest to any farmers that the quickest way to obtain any social welfare assistance is through the smallholders' dole as constituted for farmers on extremely low incomes.  The Government is sympathetic to cyclical difficulties.  The extension of FIS, particularly for the self-employed and farmers, would create a difficulty where the assessment of income would be set for 52 weeks of the year.  This is not the situation in farming where there are some very good and some very bad months.  FIS is not designed for that type of cyclical work.  The Government is looking at whatever mechanisms <Col N="213" /> are available but is conscious of knock-on effects in other areas.</P>

Certainly that is not the information I have from those who have been reassessed.  I came across a case recently where a payment was reduced from £45 to £28 for a person whose wife is handicapped.  There was no realisation of the drop in income in that assessment.  It is not sympathy but money farmers will need before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for assessment are contained in legislation which has been amended over the years.  If the event of falling income, social welfare inspectors would have to take that into account despite the fact that we would be unable, in the absence of legislation, to change the criteria of assessment.  In relation to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's question, I have stated in the House and outside that we are looking at the options available.  Everything we look at will have to be decided in a budgetary context.  In reply to Deputy Brady, I thank him and other Fianna Fáil Deputies who took the time to go to Northern Ireland to see how the equivalent scheme works there.  I thank them for their information, though my Department was already aware of it, as was I. As I said earlier, the family credit system in the North is being changed to a tax credit system, so it is not exactly analogous to the situation here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three Deputies for putting down these questions.  The unofficial work stoppage today by Iarnród Éireann locomotive drivers is to be greatly regretted.  I wish to express clearly my regret at what has happened and in particular at what is unofficial action.  This has caused inconvenience and great hardship to commuters all over the country, not just in Dublin, and to those going about their ordinary business. It damages the reputation of the railways as an effective and reliable means of transport.  Iarnród Éireann management and unions have been engaged in lengthy and difficult restructuring negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Government and I, and I am sure the House, are strongly committed to the future of the railway in Ireland, as are the management and unions in Iarnród Éireann.  Given that commitment, progress can best be made by management and unions in the company working together in a co-operative spirit to conclude these negotiations.  The parties to the negotiations are themselves the best placed to resolve the remaining difficulties.</P>
      <P>I thank the Labour Relations Commission for facilitating the discussions between management and unions and particularly for its day-long efforts last Sunday to try to get discussions back on track to avert today's unofficial action.  While these talks were unsuccessful in preventing today's stoppage, I understand that a formula put forward by the Labour Relations Commission to get over the current difficulties will be discussed on Thursday by the unions representing Iarnród Éireann drivers.  This formula is acceptable to Iarnród Éireann management and I hope it will be acceptable to the unions.  I urge all parties to get around the table as soon as possible to resolve their remaining difficulties and to bring those talks to a successful conclusion.</P>

Will she extend her apologies and not just her regrets to them about <Col N="215" /> what has happened?  The Minister knew about this threatened strike for at least four to five days. Why did she not have a contingency plan in place to ensure people could get to work today without waiting two or three hours for buses that did not turn up?  Why did the Minister not take the initiative to hire private buses to allow people to get to work?  Will the Minister assure the House that there will not be further such stoppages?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully and utterly accept my political responsibilities, even though the chairman was keen last week that I did not take responsibility and that I leave the matter to CIE as he said.  I fully accept my political responsibilities for the bodies under my aegis, and I always have.  Yes, I apologise for this unofficial action.  It is not an official strike; it is unofficial.  I accept absolutely my political responsibility, and that is what I told the chairman last Wednesday and yesterday.</P>
      <P>I have known about this since last Friday morning, and I have been working practically every day to try to ensure that there would not be an unofficial stoppage.  Everybody's efforts in this regard failed.  The operational responsibility for Iarnród Éireann by law is with that body.  That means the provision of replacement buses would be an operational matter and not one for me, but the political responsibility is mine and it is one I will carry out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that responsibility for solving the dispute rests with management and the unions, and that it is a matter for them to resolve, she is in effect standing back from this dispute.  In her own phrase she is leaving it to them to resolve.</P>
      <P>In relation to political responsibility, does the Minister agree that the most essential thing a public transport system needs is certainty, and that uncertainty is at the heart of this dispute? There is uncertainty among unions and staff as to management's intentions, and there is uncertainty among management and the board as to the Minister's intentions.  Does the Minister agree that it is her political responsibility to restore some certainty to the context in which this dispute is taking place and to indicate clearly what resources will be available for investment in rail transport as well as what the Government's policy on the development of rail transport will be?  This should be done rather than allowing a situation to continue in CIE where the talk is of cuts rather than development of the system.  That seems to be at the root of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore said I was standing back.  I am not, and that seems to be a difficulty for some of the participants in this matter.  Deputy Gilmore also mentioned certainty.  I agree that for some time &mdash; I am not referring to the Government Deputy Gilmore was part of &mdash; there was a lack of certainty in Iarnród Éireann <Col N="216" /> as to the future of the railways.  That goes back as far as the mid-1980s, as the safety report clearly states.  For the first time there is a rail investment subhead in the Estimates for next year, which never happened before.  There will be investment under that subhead from now on.</P>
      <P>I have met the board of CIE four times since coming into office &mdash; three times at Heuston Station and once when it came to see me.  We had an independent safety study done which clearly lays out what is to be spent on the railways, and I have asked them to furnish me with their investment needs as distinct from railway safety.  We will be conveying what we can of those needs to the EU, but we will also look at Exchequer funding, public-private financing and CIE's own financing.</P>
      <P>I am not uncertain as to the future of the railways.  However, the taxpayer makes a massive investment in the railways.  We must ensure there is a good return on that investment and there must be political responsibility for overseeing that process.  I was given my job by the Taoiseach and the President gave me my seal of office.  I will not stand down from dealing with this matter merely because someone said I should.</P>

      <P>Given the Minister's acceptance of her political responsibility and the failure of the current format of negotiations on a viability plan for CIE, which has resulted in today's regrettable unofficial industrial action and traffic chaos and disruption throughout the country, will she agree to change or revamp these negotiations to ensure she or her representative is directly involved in them?  As the shareholder and owner of the company, will she agree it is essential she should be so involved, notwithstanding the advice or demand of the chairman of CIE that she should mind her own business, as if this was not her business? Will she also agree the format I proposed of direct ministerial involvement in negotiations was successful on a previous occasion when a cost and competitiveness review was successfully negotiated with ESB unions, its management and, most importantly, the Minister's representative was directly involved?</P>

An employee of the Labour Relations Commission has been involved in these negotiations on a full-time basis for the past 18 months.  I have faith in that machinery of Government.  The Labour Relations Commission does a good job and is acting as a facilitator and conciliator.  I note the Deputy's proposal that a representative, acting on behalf of the Government, should be involved in such talks.  The Government appointed John Behan to be part of that process and he attends all the talks and works with all those involved in them.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister and she has put her finger on it.  Commuters pay the subsidy for Iarnród Éireann, while in most European countries Governments pay the bulk of it.  Does she agree that investment in public transport has been nothing short of pathetic?  A total of 10 per cent of the EU operational programme was spent on rail compared to 53 per cent on roads.  Is she saying that CIE is satisfied with the level of investment by the Government?  Will there be special provision in the Finance Bill for capital investment in railways?  Is she prepared to arrange a meeting with the staff of CIE affected mostly by this dispute so that the rest of us who use trains will not be forced to cycle 22 miles from Balbriggan to the House as I did today?  Will there be a resolution of this matter tomorrow?</P>

I cannot speak about the Finance Bill in advance of its introduction.  The Deputy asked if I would arrange a meeting and, yes, I would be glad to arrange a meeting.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Emmet Stagg's questions, if I inadvertently misled the House, I would be glad to come here tomorrow and openly correct it.  Mr. John Behan is reimbursed by CIE.  He reports to me informally.  He deals with management.</P>

      <P>Deputy Éamon Gilmore asked why in spite of the appointment of trouble shooters the situation in Iarnród Éireann is as it is.  It is because it is a very difficult and complex situation going back over a great number of years.</P>

      <P>Today's event is exacerbated by an unofficial group &mdash; there are two official unions and an unofficial group.  CIE needs to be put in shape as quickly as possible.  The first viability plan was produced four years ago.  It is time to look at it in a modern sense, in the light of the recent safety report in particular which made reference to restructuring.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret what happened in this city and country today with regard to public transport.  I hope there will not be a recurrence.  I intend to carry out my duties and to act as Minister with responsibility for public transport.</P>

      <P>It is not.  As the Deputy is aware, the Refugee Bill, 1996, was enacted on 26 June that year.  A commencement order to give effect to sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 55 was made at the end of August last year.  The remaining sections have not been implemented.  The procedures were designed to deal with 300 to 400 applications per year and only provided for the appointment of one refugee applications commissioner without the power to delegate.  By the end of 1996 there were over 1,000 applications for asylum in hand.  This had increased to almost 4,000 by the end of 1997.  Over 4,000 applications have been lodged so far this year.

The compellability legislation is being drafted and much work has been done on it.  I indicated last week that the timeframe was two weeks.

The debate on the Estimates will be held this week while the budget will be debated from 2 December.  Will the Taoiseach arrange to have the motion taken next week?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate that it will be necessary to amend the Constitution if there is to be devolution of powers to the two new regions he proposes in line with the powers held by regions in other parts of Europe?  Is he making preparations for a referendum in that regard?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject any criticism that the figures in this year's Estimates, or the presentation of those figures, have been manipulated in any way so as to create a misleading impression of what the true increase in spending is.  In my statement on the publication of the Estimates on 11 November, I set out in a clear and unambiguous way the basis <Col N="239" /> on which the annual average increase of 3.9 per cent represented by the 1999 Estimates was calculated.  The figures were presented in an open and transparent manner.  There is nothing to be gained by attempting to conceal the facts and, as I said when presenting the Estimates, whether one agrees with the Government's 4 per cent limit, there can be no doubt as to the basis on which that limit is measured.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, to have this opportunity to set out clearly again for the Dáil and the public the Government's approach to public expenditure and how it is reflected in the 1999 Estimates. The Government takes very seriously its commitment to limit expenditure growth.  If the growth of public spending is not controlled, we risk undermining the prudent budgetary policies which have done so much for the success of the economy in recent years.  The Government is not prepared to let this happen.</P>
    <P>Before I set out the position on the Government's spending plans for 1999, I would like to review the general economic position since it provides the context within which budgetary and expenditure policy must be seen.  On the whole, 1998 has turned out to be another year of very strong economic growth, well balanced between exports and domestic demand.  It is very encouraging that strong growth in output has again been translated into strong growth in employment. Employment has risen by about 4 per cent for the second year in a row.  There are more than 100,000 more people at work now than there were two years ago.  Unemployment has fallen to below the EU average.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years or so, Ireland has managed to combine very strong growth with modest inflation.  However, exchange rate movements in 1997 and the early part of this year saw a significant depreciation in the Irish pound's trade weighted exchange rate.  Largely as a result of this depreciation, there was a pick up in inflation here from 1 per cent in August 1997 to 3.2 per cent in August of this year.  Since then, inflation has fallen back to 2.9 per cent in October and should fall further in the coming months.  However our inflation rate is still well above the EU average and there are inflationary pressures in the housing sector and in terms of labour shortages and wage pressures.</P>
    <P>As we prepare to join EMU in less than six weeks' time, it is vital that price stability be maintained so as to sustain our international competitiveness at a time of slower world growth and very low inflation in our trading partners' economies.</P>
    <P>Our economic assessment for 1999 and the following two years will be presented in our first stability programme which is being prepared in accordance with the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.  This will be published on budget day, 2 December, so I do not propose to go into detail on this today.</P>
    <P>It is already clear, however, that next week's <Col N="240" /> budget is being framed against the background of more than usual international economic uncertainty.  The IMF and OECD have reduced their forecasts for economic growth for next year.  In short, we are facing a significant slowdown in growth in the United States and the UK, two of our most important trading partners, and greater uncertainty regarding the international economic scene.</P>
    <P>As a small and very open economy we cannot expect to remain immune from a world economic slowdown.  We are likely to see its impact in terms of slower export growth and a slower rate of growth in foreign direct investment into this country.</P>
    <P>Our budgetary planning and our expectations generally must take account of these realities.  We cannot prudently base our plans for the future on the assumption that the extraordinary rates of economic growth we have seen in the past will go on forever.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss the 1999 budgetary position today.  On budget day I will outline the economic and budgetary prospects for next year and up to the year 2001.  The economic success we have achieved is based on sound budgetary policy and on the consensus between the Government and the other social partners.  Prudent fiscal policies have allowed the Government to reduce taxation and to increase spending on key social programmes.</P>
    <P>Stable budgetary policy will become even more important in the new environment which we will be entering on the establishment of the euro on 1 January next.  This will mark the beginning of a new phase for the Irish economy with new challenges and also new opportunities.  Ireland must be in a position to take advantage of these new opportunities.  The maintenance of prudent and stable budgetary policies will be crucial in ensuring that we can do this.  In these new circumstances, firm and effective control of public expenditure will play a key role.</P>
    <P>If we want to make certain that significant reductions in taxation can continue to be delivered over the medium to long-term and that the competitiveness of our economy can continue to be improved through wage moderation and strong social consensus, the growth in public spending must be contained within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; deliberately.  I am aware that there is a perception in people's minds when the phrase &ldquo;control of public expenditure&rdquo; is mentioned, a perception of severe cutbacks in public services and the hardship which that entails for ordinary people.  However, I can assure the House that this Government's commitment to the control of public spending does not and will not result in such cutbacks or hardship for the public.</P>
    <P>This Government fully accepts that our society faces many social and economic pressures.  Many sections of our community continue to feel excluded from the general economic progress of <Col N="241" /> recent years and the increased wealth which this has created.  I assure the House that neither I nor the Government are complacent about this.  On the contrary we are acutely aware of these problems and the need to ensure that they are addressed in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
    <P>As the economy grows and more resources become available, it is inevitable that there will be pressure to increase spending on improving public services.  The Government is constantly faced with demands from strong and vocal interest groups seeking more resources.  It is simply not possible to meet all the demands that are made.  It must be recognised that there must be prudent limits on the amount of resources we can commit to improving public services.  This is why the Government's programme includes a commitment to limit the increase in net spending to 4 per cent on average over its lifetime.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this objective strikes the right balance between the requirements of a tight budgetary policy, particularly in the context of our participation in EMU, and the need to provide real additional resources to meet pressing social and economic priorities.  The Government knows that if expenditure plans do not strike this balance it will be all the more difficult to sustain the progress of recent years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that our approach to controlling spending is a concrete expression of the Government's desire to see that economic progress is accompanied by real social advance for those in genuine need.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Government's expenditure plans for 1999.</P>
    <P>I want to stress at this point that the overriding aim in the Government's consideration of the 1999 Estimates was to ensure that the commitment to limit the annual average increase in net current spending to 4 per cent over the lifetime of the Government was respected.  This has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Estimates show net current expenditure as defined in our programme, increasing by an annual average of 3.9 per cent in 1999 over the 1997 outturn.  Budget day spending measures will add somewhat to expenditure.  However, the Government's planning and preparation for the budget are based on adherence to the 4 per cent limit.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Estimates also provide for a very substantial increase in capital expenditure. Exchequer capital spending will increase by almost 27 per cent in 1999 over 1998.  The increase in 1999 follows a similar large increase in 1998 which will bring the cumulative increase in capital spending to 58 per cent over the two years.  The Government is determined that the continuation of strong economic growth in the future is not put at risk by deficiencies in our infrastructure.  Public capital investment has to be increased to ensure that bottlenecks which could hinder growth and development are removed. The level of increase in capital expenditure in 1998 and 1999 underlines the Government's commitment <Col N="242" /> to public investment which will help to sustain the growth and development of the Irish economy over the medium to long-term.</P>
    <P>I now want to review briefly 1998 spending and set out the position on 1999 expenditure.  My remarks today on both 1998 and 1999 are based on the figures published in the Abridged Estimates Volume on 11 November and take no account of any budget day spending changes.</P>
    <P>The Abridged Estimates published on 11 November included summary tables showing the latest assessment of the 1998 outturn for each Vote. As the 1999 budget will be announced on 2 December, it is appropriate that the Dáil and the public were given in the Abridged Estimates Volume information about actual emerging 1998 position.  The outturn figures given in the volume include spending which will require Supplementary Estimates for which the Government will be seeking Dáil approval before the end of the year. As the general note at the front of the Estimates Volume indicated, the 1998 outturn figures reflect present knowledge and they have to be revised. Present indications are that the outturn figure for the total net voted current spending will be somewhat higher than that published in the Abridged Estimates.  However, it is expected that the outturn will still be lower than the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Revised Estimates Volume provided for total net voted current spending of £11,020 million.  This was an increase of 6.6 per cent on the 1997 outturn.  The figures published in the Abridged Estimates indicate that net voted current expenditure in 1998 is estimated at £10,991 million, £29 million lower than the budget figure and 6.3 per cent higher than 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government has had to face pressures for increased spending in a number of areas this year, the main one being public service pay.  It has been possible, however, to keep overall net voted current spending within budget due to lower spending in some areas, most notably on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The main changes on the budget day figures are as follows: as I have already mentioned, the pay bill is estimated to be £131 million higher than originally expected.  The main reasons for the increase are the Garda pay agreement and the Garda and prison officer overtime which, together, will add an extra £80 million to the original Estimate on the Justice Group of Votes.  As a result of this and additional costs in other areas, the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1998 will be 9 per cent greater than the previous year. Extra spending of £29 million will arise in agriculture and food, primarily because of the package of measures approved by the Government to support farmers.  Spending on social welfare will be significantly lower as a result of lower than anticipated numbers on the live register and increased PRSI receipts.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in this House and elsewhere since the Abridged Estimates were published on the position of health spending in 1998.  The Minister for Health and Children and I have explained the position at great length to <Col N="243" /> the House and I do not intend to go over this ground again today.  I will simply repeat the fundamental point that the gross allocations of the Department of Health and Children in this year's Estimates will be fully applied to improving the health services.  It is absolutely incorrect and misleading to suggest that moneys allocated to health agencies will remain unspent.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Estimate for capital expenditure was £1,948 million.  The outturn is expected to be £1,928 million, some £20 million lower.  The main changes on the Estimate are that £22 million education capital was allocated to allow for the primary and second level schools building programme, an extra £13 million was provided for IDA building grants and for the county enterprise boards and lower spending in other areas resulted in a reduction of overall spending of £20 million.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the 1999 current supply service expenditure Estimates.  The abridged Estimates volume shows that total net current supply services spending will increase from an estimated outturn of £10,991 million this year to £11,939 in 1999, an increase of £948 million.  Of this increase, £301 million, or one third, is to cover additional Exchequer pay and pension costs next year and the balance, £647 million, is for additional non-pay costs.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the Exchequer pay and pensions bill will amount to £6,077 million, an increase of £300 million, or 5.2 per cent over the projected outturn for 1998.  This includes provision of £130 million for general round increases under the terms of the Partnership 2000 pay agreement and a further £58 million to cover local bargaining increases under Partnership 2000.  There will be a reduction of £66 million due to retrospective payments during 1998 in relation to various local bargaining settlements under the terms of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  Other factors, including the cost of service improvements, will add a further £179 million to the bill.  The forecast outturn for 1998 is £5,776 million, an increase of 9 per cent over the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer pay and pensions bill represents 51 per cent of total net voted current expenditure in 1999.  The significant increases in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in recent years and the fact that it represents over half of all net current voted spending demonstrate clearly that containing the growth of the public service pay costs is crucial to the Government's efforts to control public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The costly series of PCW local bargaining settlements have been a major contributory factor in the increase in 1997 and 1998.  For example, in 1997, the settlements with nurses and paramedic grades in the health services added about £100 million to the bill, and in 1998 the settlements with the craftworkers, Garda and Defence Forces have brought significant costs. The PCW local bargaining process has only now effectively drawn to a close, although the terms of the PCW expired 16 months ago in the public <Col N="244" /> service.  Only a small number of claims covering about 5 per cent of Exchequer funded employees, remain to be resolved.  I expect that the bulk of these will be finalised by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Each Department and office of State's Estimate in the abridged volume includes provision for the 1999 cost of pay increases due under Partnership 2000, both the cost of living increases and the 2 per cent local bargaining increase.  As a consequence, there will be no Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions in 1999, unlike in previous years.  This change, which is part of the new pay management and control arrangements I announced in the 1998 budget, means that Civil Service Departments and other public service employing organisations are allocated funding now for the cost of the agreed Partnership 2000 terms and will have to deal with whatever claims arise during 1999 within those allocations.  There will be no central contingency fund to fall back on, as has been the case under the PCW.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the terms of Partnership 2000, including the explicit limit on the cost of local bargaining increases, is adhered to within the public service if we are to continue to manage the public finances and the economy in a balanced and responsible way.</P>
    <P>In the Abridged Estimates, the Government has allocated a net additional £647 million for the improvement of the non-pay element of expenditure programmes in 1999.  Some £224 million of this increase is accounted for by the establishment of a new local government fund next year &mdash; I will come back to this shortly.  Leaving aside this technical item, the increase in non-pay current expenditure in 1999 is £423 million.  Some of the key policy areas to which this is allocated are as follows.</P>
    <P>An additional £121 million is being allocated to Health.  The Government is very much aware of the pressures on the health service.  This substantial increase will be used to fund hospital services and to continue to develop the important initiatives launched by the Government in areas such as child care and mental and physical handicap. The Social Welfare Vote includes an extra £80 million to cover the full year costs of the improvements made by the Government in the 1998 budget and other technical factors, for example, demographic changes which will lead to increased numbers on certain schemes next year.  The gross increase is higher since savings are expected to come from a fall in the live register, reflecting recent trends.</P>
    <P>An extra £69 million is being provided for Education, including provision for a significant increase in capitation grants for primary schools from £50 to £60.  This means that capitation based funding for primary schools will have increased by over 40 per cent in two years.  Major increases have also been included to provide services for children with special needs, and both second and third level funding will be increased significantly. There will be further significant growth in the number of third level and apprenticeship places. <Col N="245" /> Defence will receive an additional £32 million, mainly for new equipment for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the increase in non-pay current spending in 1999 includes an extra £224 million on the 1999 Estimate of the Department of the Environment and Local Government as a result of the introduction of the local government fund from next year.  This change arises from the new arrangements agreed by the Government for the financing of local authorities.  Because of its one-off nature, it is necessary to adjust for this item in the calculation of the percentage increase in current spending in 1999.  It is important, therefore, that the changes which are being introduced are set out as clearly as possible so that the rationale for making the adjustment is apparent to, and understood by all.</P>
    <P>At present, local authorities receive the proceeds from motor tax revenue and their expenditure on non-national roads is paid for from money voted by the Dáil.  With effect from next January, a local government fund will be established to fund the non-national roads programme and to make a contribution to the general costs of running the local authorities.  The fund will have two sources of income: receipts from motor taxation and a contribution from the Environment and Local Government Vote.  Some £270 million is provided in the Estimate for the fund in 1999.</P>
    <P>Current spending on non-national roads is now provided for in the 1998 Environment and Local Government Vote.  Adjusting for this, the net increase in current spending in 1999 is £224 million.  To allow a valid comparison between spending in 1998 and 1999, the £224 million must be taken out of the 1999 figures for net voted current spending.  For similar reasons, to allow proper comparison of the 1998 and 1999 capital spending figures, £178 million in capital spending, which is included in the 1998 Environment and Local Government Vote but which will be financed from the local government fund in 1999, must be deducted from 1998 voted capital expenditure figures.</P>
    <P>The significant increase of almost 27 per cent in Exchequer capital expenditure next year reflects the Government's determination to provide the social and economic infrastructure which is essential to underpin Ireland's continued development.  In 1998, capital expenditure is forecast to be £1,928 million.  In 1999, the Government is providing £2,216 million, an increase of £288 million.  This additional spending is being allocated to a number of key development programmes</P>
    <P>Education and Science will receive an extra £18 million.  Of this, £12 million is for the primary building programme, with a further £3 million for special schools.  The Government has decided to allocate an extra £26 million to Agriculture.  Some £19 million more is being provided for Leader and INTERREG and the Western Development <Col N="246" /> Commission is being allocated an extra £3 million, more than double its 1998 allocation.</P>
    <P>Tourism, Sport and Recreation will receive an additional £21 million next year to fund a wide range of developments.  Grants for sports and recreational facilities are being increased by £5 million.  An additional £6 million is being provided for tourism development grants and £6 million is being allocated for the development of a 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
    <P>Capital spending on the Public Enterprise Vote is set to rise by £90 million in 1999, reflecting in large part the Government's decision to make a substantial investment in public transport, with particular emphasis on taking immediate steps to meet Dublin's traffic problems.  CIE will receive £36 million to support its investment programme.</P>
    <P>An additional £212 million is being provided for Environment and Local Government, taking account of the adjustment for the changed arrangements in local authority funding.  Housing will receive £28 million extra.  An additional £90 million is being provided for water and sewerage schemes. The Government has decided that significant additional resources are required to meet road transport needs.  Accordingly, road projects are being allocated an additional £54 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Health capital spending is £155 million, over 5 per cent higher than the 1998 outturn, which is significantly higher than that for 1997.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the very substantial increase in capital expenditure which the Government has provided in both the 1998 and 1999 Estimates is fully justified.  The very strong economic growth in recent years has placed severe pressures on the country's infrastructural capacity.  Significant investment is required to ease these pressures.  It is also essential to the healthy and balanced development of the country that some of the resources generated by growth should go to improve social facilities and amenities.</P>
    <P>I want to explain how the 1999 expenditure plans fit in with the limits on spending to which the Government is committed.  The Government is committed to limiting the growth in net current expenditure to 4 per cent a year on average for the lifetime of the Government.  As I explained to this House previously, net current expenditure for the purpose of the 4 per cent limit is defined as net voted current expenditure plus spending on central fund services, which is mainly the cost of servicing the national debt.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear to this House also, particularly in the context of its consideration of the Estimates for 1998, the base to be used in calculating the average increase in net current spending for the purpose of the Government's 4 per cent limit is the 1997 outturn.  Much criticism was directed at the Government when the 1998 Estimates were published.  It was said that using the 1997 outturn as the base was misleading in view of the fact that significant additional expenditure was incurred at the end of 1997 which had the <Col N="247" /> effect of increasing the 1997 outturn, thereby reducing the percentage increase in 1998 and the annual average increase in subsequent years.  As I indicated in this House when the 1998 Abridged Estimates were being debated, this criticism was totally misplaced.  The payments that were made at the end of 1997 were completely legitimate and proper.</P>
    <P>I set out the position on these payments clearly and fully when the 1998 Estimates were published and again when they were debated in this House this time last year.  The reason I mention this now is that I have heard the same criticism on the use of the 1997 outturn repeated this year in relation to the 1999 Estimates.  Having explained the position fully last year, I have no intention of going over the same ground again this year.  As far as I am concerned, the matter has been dealt with comprehensively and the criticism shown to be unjustified.</P>

      <P>Central fund expenditure is not included in the Abridged Estimates since Dáil approval for it is not required each year.  We therefore have to add the figures in the Estimates volume to those for the central fund.  I would emphasise that the figures for the central fund for 1999 are provisional.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the 1999 Estimates volume, and the provisional figures for central fund services, total net current spending will rise by an annual average of 3.9 per cent over the 1997 outturn. This is after adjusting for the changes in local authority funding which I mentioned earlier. While additional spending measures, mainly on social welfare, will be announced on budget day, I can assure Deputies that the Government's decision making for the budget is being done in a spirit of determination that the 4 per cent limit will be adhered to.  Exchequer capital spending in 1999 is increasing by 26.6 per cent over the forecast 1998 outturn after adjusting for the changes in local authority funding.  The cumulative increase in capital spending in 1999 over 1997 is 58 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have enjoyed another year of strong growth.  The rapid expansion in our economy has created significant strains in our infrastructure and is increasing people's expectations and demands for the delivery of more and better public services.  Our continued economic success will depend crucially on the maintenance of prudent budgetary policies, particularly in the context of our participation in the single currency.  Control of public expenditure has a very important role to play in this regard.  What is required is a disciplined approach which aims to contain the increase in day to day spending to reasonable levels, <Col N="248" /> while at the same time providing sufficient additional resources to meet the legitimate demands of those in genuine need.  A significant boost to public capital investment is also required to ensure that the economy can continue to develop efficiently and effectively.  This is the approach on which the Government's expenditure plans, as set out in the 1999 Abridged Estimates volume and summary public capital programme, are based.  I can assure Deputies that the same policy will be firmly implemented throughout the Government's term of office and will secure Ireland's continued economic progress in the years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of my contribution to this debate on the Estimates, I would like to pose a number of questions.  Is the Minister for Finance proposing to spend too much money in 1999?  Is he proposing to spend more than he promised?  Is there any sign he is reordering his spending priorities or, to put it more simply, is his additional spending going on the right programmes? How much will he add to his expenditure plans on budget day?  Will he do a better job in controlling the cost of the public sector pay bill than he did in 1998?  Is the Minister merely responding to the expenditure demands of other Ministers or has he an overall plan to guide and control public expenditure?</P>
      <P>It now appears to be an impossible task for the Minister for Finance to hold the increase in current expenditure to 4 per cent.  The Government commitment to do so was a clever political ploy and, for this political purpose, net current spending is defined as the aggregate of net voted current expenditure and expenditure on central fund services.  Consequently, savings on debt servicing allow the Minister to spend significant amounts in excess of 4 per cent in net voted spending.  The bonus of additional PRSI receipts from the increased number at work also assists the Minister.  We can see this clearly in an introductory note on page 2 of the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's annual average increase in total net current spending over the 1997 outturn over the two years 1998-9 is 3.9 per cent but this represents an increase of 6.5 per cent in net voted expenditure or, to use the words from the Book of Estimates, the &ldquo;underlying expenditure&rdquo; is 6.5 per cent.  The increase in total net current expenditure in 1998 over 1997 was estimated last year at 3.7 per cent.  The Minister's average for the two years was 3.9 per cent so, even on the basis of the Government's ambiguous election promise, the increase this year exceeds 4 per cent.  That is not the end of the story; the Minister has departed from the practice of recent years and has not made any allowance in the Estimates for <Col N="249" /> increases in social welfare payments on budget day.</P>
    <P>In his first budget last year, the Minister committed an additional £200 million of spending on budget day.  Last year's social welfare package was meagre and the Minister is expected to do better this year at extra cost.  The Minister for Health and Children has already promised additional budget day spending on waiting lists and the needs of the handicapped.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has hung a threat of resignation over the Government if the allocation for overseas development aid is not significantly increased.  It seems fairly certain, therefore, that the Minister's increase in expenditure on budget day will be greater than the £200 million he spent last year.  If we allow for a very modest increase to £240 million, this will add a further 1.5 per cent in expenditure terms to the Minister's Estimates resulting in a year on year increase of 5.6 per cent according to the Minister's clever political way of calculating the figures or, to quote the Estimates, on the &ldquo;underlying increase&rdquo; in net voted expenditure of 8.1 per cent.  The real increase is 8.1 per cent when the Minister spends the savings he is making on the central fund and the extra PRSI receipts.  Perhaps the Minister has a trick up his sleeve to balance budget day increases in expenditure through further savings but we have not yet received an indication of any planned significant expenditure cuts for budget day.</P>
    <P>This is not the end of the expenditure story. The Minister has based his Estimate on a very benign view of the 1999 increase in public service pay which he estimates at 5.2 per cent.  The Minister does not make any allowance for additional spending to settle the variety of public service pay disputes on the industrial relations horizon.  Last year, the Minister estimated that the 1998 increase in public service pay over 1997 would be 6 per cent.  He was appalled at the size of this increase, blamed his predecessors for it, described it as unsustainable and made its reduction an absolute priority.  The 1998 outturn was 9 per cent, a figure the Minister has confirmed on a number of occasions, most recently in his speech this evening.</P>
    <P>The 1998 increase in public service pay was 9 per cent &mdash; the Minister's Estimate was 6 per cent.  Doubtless, circumstances outside the Minister's control made it very difficult for him to contain the pay bill but past success is the best predictor of future success in most areas of human endeavour.  Failure in the past makes one very uneasy about the future.  The Minister for Finance failed to control the public service pay bill in 1998.  Is it likely he will be more successful in the industrial relations circumstances which present themselves as we move into 1999?  I do not believe he will succeed in keeping the pay bill increase at 5.2 per cent so an additional amount should be added to the 8.1 per cent in net voted spending for 1999 which is already contained in this Book of Estimates in order that a realistic <Col N="250" /> view of the actual expenditure in 1999, as represented by the 1999 outturn, can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the Government's commitment is to contain the annual average increase in total current expenditure using the 1997 outturn as a base.  He will probably indicate that he intends doing some wild and wonderful things to contain current expenditure in next year's budget and that of the following year, that is if he is still Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister that the political calendar moves on, something he knows very well as an experienced politician.  Whatever chance a Minister for Finance has of controlling public expenditure at the start of an Administration, he has little hope of doing so once a Government passes its mid point.</P>
    <P>The Minister is planning to spend almost £1 billion extra on current programmes next year. The 1999 outturn will show an increase of over 9 per cent on 1998 if the Government's pay strategy succeeds.  If the Government gets into serious pay difficulties the increase will exceed 10 per cent. This is an extraordinarily high level of expenditure when a CPI figure of less than 3 per cent is accepted for 1999 and when most commentators are predicting that inflation, having peaked at 3.2 per cent in August and which is now under 3 per cent, will continue to decrease somewhat during 1999.  Even if we allow for double digit growth figures in GNP for 1998, it is still an extraordinary amount of money to be spending on the current side.  No doubt there are huge demands on the Minister for Finance to spend more.  The job of the Minister for Finance in the 1980s was to reduce public expenditure.  In the 1990s the emphasis moved to controlling public expenditure and ensuring the economy grew.  I believe that now a Minister's actions will be judged in the context of the input to social justice and equity of his spending programme.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem in the Minister's approach is that he is showing huge increases in public expenditure but is not improving the services for which the public pay.  A very clear illustration of this may be seen in the Minister's introduction of the 1999 Book of Estimates.  In reviewing current expenditure for 1998 he pointed out there were some increases over the Estimate which were going to be offset by substantial reductions.  The Minister continued by saying what the main increases would be:</P>
    <P>On pay it is estimated that expenditure will be £131 million higher than originally estimated.  The Garda pay agreement is the largest single factor in this.  The pay provision in the Justice Vote is £80 million higher than the original Estimate to cover the Garda pay agreement and additional overtime for both gardaí and prison officers.  To offset these increases savings are likely to be made on spending across a number of Votes.  Of these the largest savings of £117 million arises from social welfare, mainly as a result of a reduction in the live register below the expected levels and <Col N="251" /> increased PRSI receipts.  Health non-pay expenditure is also estimated to be £42 million lower than the original estimate, largely because of increased health contributions. Health programme spending will not be down.</P>
    <P>Here we have the nub of the problem.  It is as good an example as we are likely to get of the Minister's failure.  Expenditure on pay will be £131 million higher than estimated in 1998 and this will be offset by savings in social welfare and health.  The savings will not be used to give better social welfare payments to the elderly, the poor or families with children.  Neither will they be used to reduce the national debt.  Rather they will be used to balance the pay bill which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform failed to control.</P>
    <P>In current economic circumstances the Government should spend more to improve the health services, eliminate poverty and help the disadvantaged.  However, even when the Estimates plan huge additional expenditure the bulk of it is used to reinforce existing spending programmes and to cover overruns in pay.  This is the principal failure of the Government and the Minister.  He is spending more, with plans to spend an extra £1 billion on the current side this year.  In the medium term he is probably spending far too much.  However, the problem is that the Minister and the taxpayer is getting very little return for the extra expenditure.  The taxpayer continues to pay more for unsatisfactory social services.  The waiting lists in hospitals are returning to 40,000 persons, the level they were last at when the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government left office in 1992.  If the Minister for Health and Children did the honest thing and released the figures from his Department we would probably find they have reached 40,000.  However, we were told that releasing the figures was not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The poor are sinking deeper into poverty and increasingly there is an underprivileged, disadvantaged underclass which the decisions of the Government are institutionalising.  Against this background there has been no attempt by the Minister to examine, re-evaluate or prioritise spending programmes.  The Estimates campaign proceeds along traditional lines.  The Department of Finance seeks to impose spending limits on the line Departments and the line Departments at official and ministerial level fight for increases on every spending programme as if they were all equally important.  A bad compromise is reached, the no policy change increases are factored in and some development funds for expanding services are included.  In the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science, for example, the development funds are in the pay Votes because these services are principally improved through the employment of additional staff.  The Minister then fails to control the pay bill and much of the expenditure intended <Col N="252" /> to improve the services is hovered up by the rising pay bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must re-evaluate all spending programmes.  To do so effectively he must change the manner in which the Estimates are agreed between the Department of Finance and other Departments.  The people best positioned to re-evaluate spending programmes are those at departmental level who run them.  Currently, they have no incentive to do so.  I propose that in preparing next year's Estimates the Government should allocate an envelope of money to each Department to cover the no policy change position of the Department.  Departments should be asked to prioritise their spending programmes within this envelope of funds and those which show savings by prioritising spending programmes should be rewarded with additional funds for the delivery of additional and improved services within their remit.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficulties arise from the Minister's inability to control the pay bill, something for which the Minister can thank many of his Government colleagues who were totally irresponsible in Opposition.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform led the charge of the gardaí towards industrial action while the Minister for Health and Children actively fanned the anger of the nursing unions.  The Government is now reaping the whirlwind.  Special pay claims by public service unions must be processed in a new way.  It seems the policy of the Department of Finance since the early 1990s is to break the relativities between different groups of public servants.  This was a legitimate policy but it has not worked.</P>
    <P>Leapfrogging and attempts at leapfrogging have continued and the attempts under the PCW to ring-fence pay increases to particular categories of workers through the use of productivity and flexibility deals has been an abject failure.  The lever of productivity has been used to get quite high special wage increases but little or no productivity is then conceded by the public service unions.  The Garda deal which allowed one group of workers to negotiate a new claim under a phase of an agreement for which they had already completed negotiations has proven the last straw. Unless the Minister quickly deals with the small number of outstanding claims under PCW and succeeds in keeping within the pay parameters of Partnership 2000 in 1999, his estimate of a 5.2 per cent increase in the pay bill in 1999 will be well off target.  I see no proposal from the Minister which gives grounds for optimism, while the Taoiseach's proposals have all the appearances of PCW mark II.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again reaffirmed his intention of abolishing Vote 4 and distributing the special pay residual fund among Departments.  Departments are supposed to deal with claims under Partnership 2000 and the local bargaining phase of 2 per cent with that money at their disposal. Most of the development fund provided for the Departments of Health and Children and Education <Col N="253" /> and Science are going to the pay Vote. Better education requires more teachers.  Better health services require more doctors and nurses. At the same time the Minister is saying that if the Minister for Health and Children has to pay more to the nurses in 1999 he is on his own as there is no contingency from the Department of Finance. He will have to pay it out of own resources.  The bottom line on that arrangement is that there will not be money to pay for the extra staff.  The claim that the health services will improve by employing extra staff is spurious because out of the same Vote, the Minister for Health and Children will have to settle his outstanding problems with nurses, ambulance drivers and various other people while the Minister has given an absolute commitment he will not get an extra penny.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in capital expenditure. At present this country has the vital statistics of a modern economy.  Under almost every heading, we are at the top of the international league table but this modern economy is running on the infrastructure of an under-developed country.  Our roads and particularly our city streets are choked with traffic.  Local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have insufficient serviced land to allow the building industry to provide affordable housing to young people.  Untreated sewage flows freely into our lakes and rivers and our public transport grinds to a halt.  Dublin Airport cannot accommodate its throughput of passengers.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented wealth creation, there was never a higher level of stress, frustration and anger among ordinary people going about their ordinary day to day business.  It is high time a capital programme, designed to increase the capacity of our infrastructure, to meet today's needs and allow for the inevitable expansion of the future was put in place.  The Government's response in addressing the infrastructural needs has been slow.  Individual Cabinet Ministers seem to be afraid to make a decision.  Many Ministers seem to think their function is to act as public relations officers for themselves and their Departments.  The Civil Service is a fine body of men and women.  However, they need policy decisions from Ministers and the Government before they can act.  So far as I can establish, about half the Cabinet have yet to make a decision, even a bad one, since they entered Cabinet 18 months ago.  This is the reason so many problems are not addressed and a significant amount of the additional capital being provided by the Minister for Finance will remain unspent at the end of 1999 or will be rushed at the end of the year into bad spending projects.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware that the inability of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide additional serviced building land has weakened the impact of Dr. Bacon's proposals.  The Minister grasped the nettle, brought proposals into the House and enacted the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, which it was hoped would work.  The failure has been on the supply side because the money which this House voted to the <Col N="254" /> Department of the Environment and Local Government has not resulted in extra serviced building land in 1998.  The bottleneck continues, demand is still out-stripping supply while the Minister for the Environment and Local Government wrings his hands and lectures us through the frequent press releases from the pinnacle of the Department which he occasionally inhabits.</P>
    <P>Another example of this can be seen in the current expenditure outturn of the Department of Health and Children for 1998.  The Minister for Health and Children did not plan the spending of the extra £65 million which came to him by way of additional health levies, which he was made aware of in mid-year.  Some £32 million is shown as a saving on the Health Vote, a saving which the Minister for Finance, when he last addressed his press conference, said he would use to fund overruns in Garda and prison officer overtime.</P>
    <P>I always appreciate the wonders of modern technology.  It is helpful to Ministers that they do not have to continue rewriting scripts because with the word processor one can do a scissors and paste job which brings the salient part of one's speech forward for repetition in one's next speech.  When this part of the Minister's statement at his press conference was brought forward into today's speech, the savings of £42 million in Health had disappeared from the word processor. It disappeared because the Minister for Health and Children was so embarrassed in this House that he went back to Government and said: &ldquo;please let me spend it, I will be embarrassed if they say I have money left over&rdquo;.  Everybody knows that six weeks from Christmas one cannot spend on patient care in hospitals because one needs to plan in advance.  Instead the Minister gave the money to the health boards to enhance their pension funds which he considered to be light.  What a way to behave?  Bad Ministers who do not make decisions and who do not plan their budgets will end up in crisis.  That is happening right across Departments.</P>
    <P>The Government is fortunate that it lives in such good economic times.  Half of the Cabinet would be threadbare if they were playing against bad economic circumstances.  The Minister came into office 18 months ago with much goodwill from all sides of the House.  For many years he had stressed the importance of controlling public expenditure and he sounded impressive.  He talked a very good game.  His record does not match his rhetoric and the political clock is ticking away.  We will still wonder on budget day, even though the Minister can talk the talk, whether he can walk the walk.</P>

      <P>That is the key question.  I wish to ask two questions arising from the Minister's contribution which I think were omissions.  What is the Minister's estimate of additional numbers in the public service in 1999 over 1998?  I presume he has made an allocation to the main Departments <Col N="255" /> and has informed the Department of Health and Children, for example, that out of that extra money he has put into the pay Vote it can employ so many extra head of staff.  If so, has he broken it down on the health care side &mdash; nurses, doctors, registrars, consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be many consultants in the Department because those Votes are very heavy, but not in the hospitals.  There will have to be consultants for pension funds to see how they spend the Minister's Christmas eve largesse.  Pensions are very important to people but are not a priority spend coming up to Christmas.  The lead-in time for maturing pensions is long.  The lead-in time while waiting for a bed to have one's heart fixed up is not as long as the lead-in time to a pension fund.  In respect of the Justice and Education Votes will the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, when replying, do a similar exercise on the number of extra gardaí, prison officers and teachers?  Most of the development fund is in the pay Votes and I would like to have those figures on the record.</P>
      <P>Another figure which would be of interest is the Department's estimate of inflation in the building industry, as measured by public service tenders.  The Minister mentioned all the extra money which would be spent on capital to provide hospitals next year.  He saved plus 5 per cent. I am of the view that year on year tenders for the provision of, or extensions to hospitals would have gone up by at least 15 per cent.  A nominal increase of 5 per cent, on a capital vote in any sector, is falling well short of inflation as measured by successful tenders coming in on a square metre by square metre comparative basis. I would be surprised if that is not the case.  While I welcome the capital expenditure increases he has made &mdash; they more than compensate for inflation and will enable Departments to carry out excellent work &mdash; he chose a bad example when he highlighted the Health Vote because 5 per cent extra on health does not give the additionality.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember from his time in the Department of Health that the Tallaght Hospital was being built and the underlying increase for spending in Health in 1997 was about £130 million, of which a large amount was for Tallaght Hospital.  The underlying amount of capital spending was about £100 million.  In the three year programme the Minister for Health put in £150-£165 million.  The programme was agreed.  It was a very significant increase in 1998 over the underlying increase in <Col N="256" /> 1997 and previous years.  The allocation for 1999 over 1998 should be looked at in relation to the 1997 figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let Deputy Rabbitte deal with the 1997 base argument as he is an expert on that matter.  I agree that there was a significant decrease in capital spending on health in 1998 over 1997, however, the Government is not continuing that into 1999.  The Government is showing a 5 per cent increase, and that is far off the inflation on tenders going to all Departments as I understand it.</P>

      <P>If someone set out to deliberately devise a bad value for money exercise, one could not construct a worse failure than the Irish prison system.  It fails under all headings. If the purpose of prison is to rehabilitate and to deter, the figures speak for themselves.  Deputy Noonan has rightly laid emphasis on the public pay bill.  Last June we debated the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in committee, when the Minister assured us that there would be no problem with the blue flu and that there would no need for a Supplementary Estimate, funding would come from the marvellous contingency fund.  Yet two weeks ago there was no money in the contingency fund, and we had to move a substantial Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is the same for the prison pay bill.  The Estimate for prison pay in 1999 is £109,548,000, which is an increase of 16 per cent over the current year. That works out at an average of £41,000 per prison officer.  The Minister confirmed to me last week by way of question that the overtime bill for the first ten months of this year for the prison service is £28 million, and £33 million over the full year.  That is £12,378 in overtime per prison officer.  Where is the rationale for that, let alone the fiscal restraint?</P>
      <P>We have the ridiculous situation of having the same number of prison officers as prisoners, which is unique in the world.  Overcrowded schools and hospitals must look with envy at the generosity of the staffing regime of our prisons, which is more like a babysitting service than a prison service.  It costs £46,000 per annum, or £125 per day, to keep someone in prison, as opposed to £79 to keep someone in the relative luxury of the Burlington Hotel.  The costs and staffing levels are bad enough, but we have very little return to show.  The prison service gives an entirely negative dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is at a loss as to why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has constantly refused to accept the promptings of Dr. T. K. Whitaker's report or his own Department's report on tackling crime, or the lessons learnt from international experience to move towards a more enlightened, more effective and more cost-efficient policy of penal reform.  Negative penal policy seems to be an immovable cornerstone of the Minister's zero tolerance philosophy.  In <Col N="257" /> reality there is no rehabilitation or deterrent value.  Even if the will existed, almost half of those sent to prison receive sentences of less than three months, while three quarters of all sentences are for less than one year.  Where is the rehabilitation or deterrent here?</P>
    <P>Of the 10,000 people who pass through the prison service each year, approximately 2,500 are jailed for non-payment of fines or civil debts, which is a waste of resources and prison space.  In addition, seven out of ten people who go to prison reoffend on release.  This underlines the theory that prison is an expensive way of making damaged people worse.  Dr. Paul O'Mahony's study of Mountjoy Prison, published in June 1997, showed that 77 per cent of those surveyed had spent time in St. Patrick's Institution.  Those surveyed had an average of 14.3 convictions or an average of 10.3 separate sentences.</P>
    <P>At present there are 200 people in jail convicted of sex offences, but only ten are receiving treatment or therapy.  Apart from the daily swelling of the ranks of convicted sex offenders, how can any Government allow 190 people with a proven propensity to reoffend to be released back into the community without rehabilitation, therapy or treatment?  Treatment should be mandatory and intensive.  The release of untreated paedophiles leaves the Minister open to the real possibility of substantial claims from the victims of such untreated offenders.</P>
    <P>The Minister presides over a system in which Mountjoy, with an official capacity of 600 prisoners, is not only drug infested but has more than 800 inmates on any one day.  They are sleeping in corridors and recreation areas.  Yet 80 miles away, in Loughan House in Cavan, there is a prison with an official capacity of 90 prisoners but it has only 40 prisoners in residence.  There are 50 empty prison spaces there.</P>
    <P>In any commercial or social sphere of activity, the managing director presiding over such a farce would be fired for failing to take corrective action.  The former Minister, Deputy Owen, commissioned 400 prison spaces in Wheatfield, a further 440 in Portlaoise, Limerick, the Curragh, Castlerea, St. Patrick's Institution and the new women's prison.  The present Minister inherited a detailed report from Deputy Owen issued by a study group set up to examine the prison system in detail.  That group recommended an overarching prison service board and suggested the draft heads of a Bill to give legislative effect to its recommendations.  Such a Bill has not appeared, and it does not even appear on the Government's list of legislative priorities.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the present shambles continues.  The Minister continues with his incarceration binge and now proposes building a further 1,000 prison spaces, presumably with a further 1,000 prison officers, at a cost of £110,000 per prison space and an operational cost of £46,000 per space, as well as a huge overtime bill.  I am very surprised that the cold, clammy logic of the Department of Finance has not intervened here <Col N="258" /> to bring some sense, order or economy to bear on penal policy.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service has a mere 150 officers and deals with 5,000 offenders per annum at a cost of £2,000 per offender.  The Minister's expert group recommended the appointment of 70 more officers three weeks ago, but he has ignored that recommendation in his Estimates.  There has been a minimum inflation increase across the range of headings and a 23 per cent cut in services.  There is no scope for developing drug treatment in prison or for treatment of sex offenders and there is no family law report.  Not one family law report is produced by the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>Offenders have completed 80 per cent of community service orders.  This is a viable alternative that works, yet it is under-utilised.  The Minister has refused to introduce attachment orders to end the wasteful jailing of fine defaulters.  He has refused to introduce instalment payment of fines and to examine prison officer training to equip prison officers to deal with therapy and rehabilitation.  The Minister refuses to embark on any imaginative alternative, and the result is that the taxpayer and society continues to carry the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is unique in some ways.  It is the first opportunity to debate spending Estimates in the context of a significant budget surplus.  For many years, until 1972, Governments of all hues operated according to a very simple dictum: one funded current services out of current moneys and one borrowed for capital purposes only.  George Colley changed all that, and each Government until a few years ago borrowed for current purposes also.  After the 1977-81 Fianna Fáil Government, the current budget deficit reached 10 per cent of GNP.  This year we have an overall Government surplus of close to £1 billion and a current budget surplus of more than twice that amount.</P>
      <P>These figures, and the measure of success we have experienced, would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.  That success is not without its challenges or difficulties.  The choices presented by success are no less important or daunting than those presented when the IMF was at the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a real opportunity to create a fairer, more equal and more civilised society.  We can bring our public services up to a standard we can all be proud of.  We can tackle disadvantage and poverty in a way that can affect the standard of living of hundreds of thousands of our people. We can make provision for the future by building the physical and social infrastructure on which the community and we, as individuals, depend. The choice is real and stark.  We can make this a country in which some rich people live, or we can make it a rich country.  We can invest in the future or we can give ourselves a few pounds more in our pay packets now.  We can build up our infrastructure in terms of our roads, railways and sewerage facilities or we can prematurely redeem <Col N="259" /> the national debt.  We can transform our schools and hospitals or we can put away the money for a rainy day.  We can channel the benefit of economic growth into public services or we can channel it into private consumption.</P>
    <P>The choice is between creating the basis for sustained economic growth and improved social provisions or giving a short-term benefit to a large minority of our people.  We can do what is right for some of us, maybe even many of us, or we can do what is right for all of us in ten or 15 years' time.  If we get it wrong and miss this opportunity &mdash; the Government is missing the opportunity &mdash; we will rightly deserve the condemnation of this and future generations.</P>
    <P>Before we can assess the performance of the Government, the Minister and this Book of Estimates we need to know something about how the choices were made and what choices were made. On 3 November last I asked nearly every Department of State to let me have certain documentation relating to the Estimates process pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.  I specifically stated in my letter that I required the information for the purpose of this debate.  I made at least ten requests to ten Departments of State.  In theory each Department has up to four weeks in which to send a reply, but as of today not one Department has sent me anything other than an acknowledgement of my original letter.  Not one Department sent me a substantive reply, good, bad or indifferent. I am entitled, as is the House and the public, to that information.  The House is entitled to know how the Minister decided to spend our money and the way he did so.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am, but my guess is that some way will be found to deny us that information, at least in the short-term.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Estimates process is not a normal decision-making process with a beginning, middle and end, but an ongoing war, a battle that never finishes.  If a Minister or a Department do not get a project through this year, they will seek to do so next year, the year after or the year after that.  Because the deliberative process is ongoing it is not possible to tell the public what is happening, but the public is entitled to know what is happening.  If the Minister for Health and Children were to decide to use his allocation to activate one project and thereby postpone another, the public is entitled to know that.  The spending Estimates, the process of which this is only a very small part, are by far the most important part of the budgetary process.  They are far more important than the minor changes that will be revealed tomorrow week.</P>
    <P>For too long the so-called Estimates campaign has been carried on almost entirely in private, usually on a bilateral basis, between the line Ministers and the Minister for Finance.  At the end of this private process the House is presented with aggregate spending figures which do not <Col N="260" /> make sense to anyone.  We are told that in this year's Book of Estimates the total block grant for the health boards is £1.7 billion.  A breakdown of that figure is not given and we must rely on press statements from the Department to tell us what this means.  That is not good enough.  It is not acceptable that we should have to tune into the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, however entertaining that may be, to find out how public moneys are being spent.  It is not good enough that we should have to put together a series of self-serving and self-congratulatory press statements from Ministers to find out what the budget or spending Estimates mean in terms of the level of services to be provided.</P>
    <P>This problem is not new and it is not the peculiar choice of the Minister, though he is peculiarly complacent and self-satisfied about a system which serves only those who work it.  I have spoken about this issue before and no doubt I will do so again.  We all know what needs to be done to make the decision-making process more open, accountable and democratic, but the Minister has no intention of doing so.  I do not intend to take up the time of House labouring this point.</P>
    <P>In the Government's programme, the two parties committed themselves to a limit of 4 per cent on net supply services over the course of the lifetime of the Government.  That limit and target does not make sense.  I want to indulge the Minister, as did Deputy Noonan, by judging him on the basis of the standard he set for himself.  A target of 5 per cent as a limit on capital spending also appears in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the Government's programme.  The Minister did not make any effort to adhere to that target which is good and, therefore, we need not detain ourselves further in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget the Minister effectively also jettisoned the 4 per cent target for current spending by bringing forward nearly £0.5 billion of future liabilities into 1997.  He effectively rigged the figures to make it look as if the 1998 increase was a good deal lower than it seemed. The Minister knows better than most that the real increase for 1998 was nearly 50 per cent higher than the 4 per cent he claimed at the time.  Given the rather obvious nature of the doctoring he carried out last year, I am flabbergasted he tried the same trick this year of averaging out the net growth over the two years.  We heard yet another bravura from the Minister this afternoon when he repeated that line.  He seems to believe that the more often he repeats it the more likely people will believe it and he seems to believe his own line.</P>
    <P>He went on to tell us that the Government is determined to stay within the 4 per cent average figure come budget day next week.  Has he thought this through?  Is he saying he will limit the increase in spending next week to £21 million or £22 million to keep it below the average figure of 4 per cent for the two years since he came into power, accepting the inflated 1997 base as the base of the calculation?  I do not believe he <Col N="261" /> intends to restrict increased spending next week to £21 million or £22 million unless he has some curious way of doctoring the books yet again or he has savings or cuts up his sleeve about which we do not know at this stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour this point but, given that the Minister has gone on about this at length, it is important to say that the figures are bogus and the promise is bogus, but it is also wrong and misguided.  We need to have a limit on spending and to ensure we get value for money.  There is a value in targets, but those figures need to be something more than figures that were picked out of the air in the context of a Fianna Fáil election manifesto with no obvious justification in terms of the economy, public finances or the need for investment.  Target spending figures should be related to all those factors, but most crucially to our ability to pay.  I and my party believe that spending targets should be related to the trend in the GNP growth rate with provision this year and for the foreseeable future for a small surplus.  That would give us the flexibility and necessary resources while ensuring that we live within our means.</P>
      <P>If we take it at its face value, the 4 per cent target tells us more about the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, than it tells us about our economy.  It confirms and demonstrates his antipathy to public services and his hostility to public spending.  I was struck by a formulation of words he used during his speech this afternoon when he spoke about the inevitable pressure and demand for improving public services, as if there was a band of Indians coming over the mountain.  People are entitled to expect there will be improved public services and more money will be spent improving the services of which they avail when we can afford it.  Why should they not expect that?  I support their entitlement to expect that.</P>
      <P>As politicians, we have a duty to respond to those demands because many of them are legitimate.  Services, be it health services or services in education, are not up to the standards in the rest of Europe or to the standards people are entitled to expect at a time when we can afford to spend more money on them.  The Minister spoke about this in fearful terms and that tells us a great deal about his priorities, his psychic and the way he approaches public spending.  If we can afford to spend more money on improving the health services and ensuring the person, to whom Deputy Noonan referred, has a heart operation earlier, we should spend that money.  We should be happy to spend it because it is a useful way of spending taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It is interesting that public spending as a percentage of GNP is still one of the lowest in the European Union.  Indeed, the money spent on public services has reduced substantially over the past two years, for example, on health services. This has not happened by accident.  The Minister made it clear on more than one occasion that he wanted to reduce the role of the State and the relative importance of public spending.  I challenge him to repeat that and spell out the consequences in terms of health, education and social welfare.  Does he want to continue to reduce the public spending-GNP ratio and the tax take as a percentage of GNP?</P>
    <P>The Minister had made the traditional arguments of the conservative right and he said he was proud of that.  If so, I want him to spell them out again.  One of the great fallacies which his attitude promotes is the notion that all spending is bad, has the same effect and is inflationary. This is complete nonsense.  We could spend hundreds of millions on capital investment tomorrow morning with little or no inflationary risk even as defined by the traditional paradigm.  Spending which is channelled into personal consumption is likely to have a different effect than money invested in infrastructure.  Is anybody seriously suggesting that increasing the capitation grant for primary schools has the same potential inflationary effect as reducing the higher rate of tax?  Does anybody believe that providing decent residential or day care for people with special needs will threaten future economic growth?</P>
    <P>I will refer to individual Estimates.  When I sought to question the Minister's officials a number of weeks ago before the most recent row about health spending, I was told the projections for next year were based on the assumption of the same level of procedures and service as this year.  That is astonishing when hospital beds lie idle and temporary nurses have been laid off and are signing on.  It is amazing that the Minister is satisfied to introduce an Estimate for next year based on the same level of service.  How can he claim that is adequate?</P>
    <P>He was very up front last week in putting the blame on the previous Government for introducing legislation which provided for a certain measure of budgetary discipline in the health boards.  I supported that legislation and still do, but what has surely been shown is that the budgets are inadequate.  The budgets need to be examined and a decision made on whether the provision to health boards should be increased so that they can increase the number of procedures. I expect the Minister to come into the House next week and tell us that an additional £5 million, £10 million or even £15 million will be provided to deal with waiting lists.  That is not the way it should be done.  The provision of additional moneys to deal with waiting lists as a &ldquo;smartie&rdquo; on budget day is not the way to deal with an obviously serious crisis in the health service.</P>
    <P>In addition to the normal provision in the health service, significant moneys are also needed <Col N="263" /> in a number of specific areas.  This is one of the challenges which we, in this economic boom, are well placed to deal with.  We can deal with drug rehabilitation, special needs and mental handicap. The plans were laid by the previous two Governments.  The cost is known and we have a good idea where the requirement is in terms of the number of places.  It can be afforded and should be done.  The Minister should make a commitment to do it.  Deputy Noonan, were he still Minister for Health and had those resources available to him, would be only too happy to put in place these plans and process to deliver the services needed.</P>
    <P>Overseas development aid was debated in the House in recent weeks.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Book of Estimates shows a 1 per cent or 2 per cent increase in overseas development aid. People, in times much worse than now made it clear that they expected us to live up our responsibilities to those who are less well off.  It is nauseating even if it is easily explained.  Perhaps, somebody took his eye off the ball or is playing political games but this is simply unacceptable. Ireland has international responsibilities to those who are less well off and it is not good enough that we must wait again for something to be pulled out of the bag on budget day in order to fulfil them.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts there are problems in Dublin in terms of public transport, yet what is the Government's response?  A couple of weeks ago it allowed CIE to start borrowing money to deal with rail safety.  Several months ago it announced that it would redistribute some of the Luas moneys to allow Dublin Bus to buy 100 extra buses and there is provision in the Estimates for 50 more.  Dublin Bus is allowed to replace one fifth of its total fleet, a fleet which everybody believes is geriatric.  It will improve public transport in Dublin, but not to the standard required. People still talk about two Luas lines when every Dubliner knows a comprehensive package is needed in ten or 15 years which will comprise much more than two lines.  There is still only one quality bus corridor in place and others are at the planning stage.</P>
    <P>I get no sense that the Government has any serious appreciation of the current crisis and how to deal with it.  I recall the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill this year when the Minister in his own inimitable way threw his hands up and said that he gets caught in the traffic on his way from Kildare to Dublin every day but had been for 20 years and we just have to live with it.  We must deal with it and the Minister has the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>He gave commitments earlier this year and in last year's Budget Statement to move to multi-annual budgeting to provide desegregated financial envelopes for the next three years for each Department.  Has that still to be done and why has it not been done with the Book of Estimates? It would have helped us a great deal to assess <Col N="264" /> policy, if the Government set out those envelopes in the Book of Estimates where they would make most sense.  We have difficulty in assessing the Government's choice when we do not know what is the overall budgetary position.  I presume the White Paper will be published later this week and we will know whether the Government intends a huge surplus next year.  I find it very difficult to debate spending when it is not known what the Government intends to do in terms of taxation reduction and surplus.  While in Opposition the Minister made comments which he repeated to some extent last year about moving to an accrual method of accounting in terms of the Estimates. What is the current position?</P>
    <P>I spoke at great length about the need to invest further in services and my colleagues who mark various spending Ministers will do likewise.  I do not want to give the impression that we are in favour of a splurge of spending &mdash; anything but. I believe very strongly in value for money and that we need to look at each programme and decide whether we are getting value because I am sure there are many cases where we are not. Deputy Noonan described the process that remains and how it writes wastage into itself.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Quinn, the Minister for Finance in the previous Government, set in train a programme of review of public spending by Department, programme and Vote.  It was intended that this would be completed within three years.  When I last asked about this one month ago I was told that eight out of several hundred programmes had been reviewed and reports had been received.  It is crystal clear that despite all his rhetoric, the Minister is not committed to value for money or evaluating how we spend the public's money and we might as well be talking to the wall as looking to him to make choices that will make a difference.</P>
    <P>These Estimates tell us a great deal about the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the accountant, but they do not tell us a great deal about Deputy McCreevy, the politician.  I get no sense of someone with a vision of how Ireland might look in ten or 20 years' time.  He has no sense of purpose, no sense of planning, no sense of a politician who wants to do something.  I certainly get no sense of a politician who has an appreciation of what is needed to tackle the inequality and disadvantage which are still endemic in our society.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the severe difficulty that students from low and middle income families now face in funding their third level education due to rapidly escalating <Col N="265" /> accommodation costs, calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive package of emergency measures to tackle this crisis.  These measures should include:</P>
    <P>&ndash; a substantial increase in income eligibility limits for student maintenance grants, with eligibility calculated on net as distinct from gross pay;</P>
    <P>&ndash; the introduction of a graduated system of entitlement to maintenance grants, with a substantial increase in the size of the maximum grant available;</P>
    <P>&ndash; a programme for the provision of good quality student accommodation in universities and institutes of technology, involving both direct State aid and tax incentives for the private sector; and</P>
    <P>&ndash; the abolition of the student registration fee. In addition, the Minister for Education and Science should undertake a review of policy with a view to ensuring a more equitable and rational geographical distribution of student numbers throughout the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach finally made free education a reality across the whole system when she abolished fees at third level.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, seeks to constantly criticise Niamh Bhreathnach on this issue.  When all the bluster is stripped away, there is only one relevant question in regard to third level fees which the Minister must answer, that is whether he intends re-introducing fees.  If the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; then his criticism is empty hypocrisy.  If his answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then all those attending or intending to attend third level education will know where they stand.  The Minister must put up or shut up.</P>
      <P>The motion which I move tonight on behalf of the Labour Party seeks on the one hand to build on the very solid foundation provided by Niamh Bhreathnach in abolishing third level fees and on the other hand, to deal with a whole series of factors that impede equality of access to third level education.  Essentially these are socio-economic and geographic factors.  This timely motion comes against a background where it is widely accepted that our highly educated workforce has been a key factor in our recent economic success. It also comes at a time when economic and social commentators have pinpointed a shortage of skilled labour as one of the key factors that may limit economic growth over the coming years. The steady supply of skilled workers is one of the most serious economic bottlenecks that our economy and society will encounter in the coming years.  It is essential that we face up to this fact now before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> Our policy in this regard should be twofold.  We must ensure that a steady stream of graduates is forthcoming from our universities and third level institutes.  We must also ensure that the obvious inequality that currently exists regarding access to third level education is addressed.  The provisions of this motion will achieve both of these important economic and social policy objectives.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the specific proposals mentioned, I wish to say a few words about the context in which this motion was proposed.  In late summer and early autumn of this year the soaring cost of accommodation in our major urban centres, where many of our third level colleges and institutes of technology are situated, became all too apparent to the families of students who have secured a place in college.  One of the key structural problems affecting our third level education system over the years has been student accommodation.  Due to a lack of capital investment, our third level institutions have not developed the on-campus student accommodation facilities that are a feature of colleges among our partners in the European Union.  Our student accommodation needs are catered for in the main by the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The serious dangers associated with this situation were made all too apparent this year by the huge inflationary factors affecting the housing market.  The demand for rented accommodation increased as more people could not afford to purchase a house and remained in the rented sector. In addition, the Government measures on foot of the Bacon report, and its appalling decision in last year's budget to slash the rate of capital gains tax, combined to produce an exodus from the rented sector by many landlords.  The problem of high demand and shrinking supply resulted in exorbitant rises in the cost of rented accommodation. This is the situation that greeted thousands of students and their families after they received an offer of a college place in the summer or prepared to return to their studies.</P>
    <P>To date, the Government has failed to introduce a package of measures to address the situation.  It has buried its head in the sand in the hope that if the problems are ignored they will go away.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The recent surge in house prices will have an effect on everyone seeking rented accommodation over the coming years.  It is a severe problem that will reappear year after year unless the Government takes action.  The Government must face up to this situation sooner rather than later. Those worst hit by the accommodation crisis are families on low and middle incomes.  The Labour Party motion before the House this evening seeks to introduce measures that will provide relief to these families and allow their children to continue their studies at third level.  The motion also seeks capital funding for on-campus accommodation that will provide a long-term solution to the current crisis.</P>
    <P>Maintenance grants are the mainstay of Government support to many students in the <Col N="267" /> third level sector.  The motion before the House this evening deals with three aspects of the maintenance grants system, namely, the level of the grant, the manner in which it is calculated and the introduction of a graduated system of entitlement.  In a Dáil reply on 22 October this year the Minister stated: &ldquo;My Department has not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third-level college&rdquo;.  That is patently obvious when one considers the latest increase in the maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>This year the value of the maintenance grant was increased by 1.7 per cent.  In real terms this meant that students living away from home received a 77p per week increase and students living at home received a 36p per week increase.  It is hard to accept that these miserly increases are in line with the escalating costs that face students and their families.  The Minister must accept that costs have increased substantially in the recent past, most obviously for students who have to find accommodation away from home.  Only a Minister living in cloud cuckoo-land could stand over an increase of 1.7 per cent.  It is clear that the current maintenance grant level of £1,624 for a student living away from home and £660 for a student living at home is wholly inadequate. These grant levels place enormous strain on both families and students attending third level.  I have no doubt that many students, either mid-way through their courses, or even when they are offered courses, fail to continue their studies due to the sheer financial pressure it places on themselves and their families.  Unfortunately, not only has the Minister no idea of how much it costs to maintain a student in a third level college, he also has no idea how many students drop out of third level.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question put by Deputy Hayes on 23 June last the Minister stated: &ldquo;Information is not readily available on the number of students who fail to complete third level courses at the institutes of technology and universities&rdquo;.  The only figure to which the Minister could refer was in a study carried out by the Higher Education Authority for students entering university in 1989-90.  This study showed that 19 per cent of students failed to finish their courses.  I read with interest an article in a newspaper today about the OECD &ldquo;Education at a Glance&rdquo; report which shows that almost a quarter of all university students fail to complete their third level education.  These figures do not refer to students attending institutes of technology.  However, the figures as they refer to the university sector are revealing.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, many factors influence the drop out rate among third level students.  However, it must be accepted that the increased financial burden imposed on families has a serious impact.  If the Government insists on maintaining grant support at the current levels and continues to measure grant increases solely on the inflation <Col N="268" /> rate as distinct from the real costs facing students, the situation can only deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The students worst affected are those from low income backgrounds.  In the interests of equality of opportunity and access, the maximum level of grant support should be increased.  In addition to an increase in the level of student grant, it is time to reform the grants system to ensure provision is made for a graduated system of support.  An arbitrary cut off point, such as the one now in existence, is not the way to handle our grants system.  There are two rates, the full rate and 50 per cent.  Where the parents' gross income exceeds £17,740, a child will receive the 50 per cent rate. It is time we took the harshness out of the system and considered the introduction of a 75 per cent rate and a 25 per cent rate.  The 75 per cent rate should be introduced as a priority.</P>
    <P>Regarding the calculation of eligibility for grants, it is unjust that eligibility limits are based on notional rather than real income.  The motion seeks to base these eligibility limits on net rather than gross income.  The relevant income figure would then be the gross figure minus PRSI contributions, Government levies and income tax. When assessment starts from the base of disposal income, it starts from a base rooted in reality. This would extend eligibility to a considerably larger group of students.  This principle was present in the last budget when the basis for the calculation of entitlement to family income supplement was changed from gross to net income. It is fair and sensible and should be extended to the calculation of third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>There is also a major failing with regard to the income limits for maintenance grants.  Income limits are increased for families which have a child currently in college.  This is a reasonable additional allowance which takes families' circumstances into account.  However, it is time to extend this principle to cover families where there is a young adult with special needs.  On the one hand we acknowledge the extra financial strain on families where a child is already attending college but, on the other, we do not recognise the additional financial strain that is placed on families with young adults with special needs.</P>
    <P>In the past fortnight, there has been a detailed debate in the House regarding the challenges and difficulties facing students with special needs and their parents.  Waiting lists are unacceptable and many families have to make considerable emotional and financial commitments to ensure that these young adults receive the quality of life they deserve.  This places an additional financial burden on the family and this should be recognised by the third level grants system.  It is time a special allowance was introduced to the current eligibility limits which would take account of the position of families with young adults with special needs.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to the abolition of the registration fee.  This fee, which covers examination and registration fees and contributions for <Col N="269" /> student services, was capped by the former Minister, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, at £150.  Since the Minister took office, the charge has increased by 73 per cent to the current rate of £260.  However, the manner in which this money is allocated is not understood by the majority of students.  There is a lack of transparency and accountability in the charge.  There is also major concern that this charge could be used to introduce fees through the back door.  The Minister's actions in increasing the charge by 73 per cent has given credence to this concern.  Are we to expect a 73 per cent increase over the coming two years, pushing up the fee to £450?</P>
    <P>I propose that a degree of transparency and accountability should be introduced into this charge as a matter of urgency.  I also propose that the current fee should be scrapped and that a new method of payment which would separate college and student service fees should be introduced. The college fees regarding examinations and registration should be linked to inflation and any move to increase these fees above this rate would have to be transparently accounted for and approved by the Minister.  The separation of the student services element of the current charge would also allow for greater accountability and transparency for students.</P>
    <P>The social aspect of college life is important and students should be expected to contribute to these costs.  However, individual colleges should account to their student bodies for the allocation and dispersal of these funds.  The funding of essential services, such as medical, career guidance and counselling services, should be funded separately from the registration fee.  The degree of pressure on young people in third level make such services a vital element of third level institutions.  We are all aware of the alarming increase in suicide among young people.  Other pressures relating to examinations, family breakdown and relationships affect young people at college.  It is vitally important to have well resourced back up services available to students.  I have grave concerns that the current funding arrangements do not provide for the necessary support services.</P>
    <P>My proposals amount to widespread reform of our third level student grants system.  They will also involve a substantial increase in the current £91 million which is spent on third level grants. However, given the importance of education in society and its crucial role in attracting investment and sustaining our recent economic growth, it is a timely and sensible investment.</P>
    <P>Beyond addressing the failings of our maintenance system and the need for expanded capital investment in on campus accommodation, the motion also calls on the Minister to seriously review our third level education system with a view to ensuring a greater geographical distribution of student numbers.  The expansion and enhancement of the institute of technology sector over the past decade has been a welcome development.  The Minister and his predecessor deserve the support of the House for their <Col N="270" /> endeavours in this regard.  However, a more imaginative and innovative approach to regional distribution could achieve major benefits in our third level sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the opportunity presented to us now should be used to actively encourage the construction of on campus accommodation. Government finances did not allow for such capital investment in the past, but our recent impressive economic performance has changed the situation.  The Minister for Finance has indicated his intention of providing substantial finance for capital projects during his tenure in office.  This is a sensible approach to economic and social planning which contrasts with his short-sighted approach to limit net current spending to 4 per cent per annum.  However, that is a matter for another day.  Unless there is an expansion of on campus accommodation the crisis in the housing sector that hit students particularly hard this year will continue.  On campus accommodation would not only relieve this problem and thereby take pressure off the private rental sector as a whole, it would assist in developing a more convivial community atmosphere on many of our college campuses.</P>
    <P>The capital required for this endeavour could come from two sources, direct Government grant to third level institutions or alternatively private companies could be invited to tender and construct the accommodation and receive tax relief on the profits for a set number of years before the accommodation is handed back to the third level institution concerned.  The Government has signalled its intention to avail of capital made available through public-private partnerships. Whether it be through this route or direct State aid to third level institutions, the Government should take action on this issue immediately, otherwise the growing student population in our major towns and cities will continue to exert immense pressure on the already strained private rental sector pushing up prices and allowing disreputable landlords who let substandard accommodation and breach the housing regulations put in place by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, to continue to rip off students and those on low incomes who have to avail of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The motion seeks to support ordinary families which endure the huge cost of sending children to third level.  This is a huge burden to thousands of families throughout the country.  The present level of support is inadequate.  For families with high disposable incomes the cost can be borne without much worry.  However, for the vast majority of families who have to make ends meet on the average industrial wage or slightly above, it creates a huge degree of hardship.  When one looks at those families which survive on wage levels below the average industrial wage or on social welfare entitlements the need for this package of measures is even more evident.</P>
    <P>The number of children from disadvantaged areas who make it to third level is shockingly low. If we are serious about creating a just and inclusive <Col N="271" /> society, removing this inequality must be a priority.  A small number of children from working class areas access third level through the CAO system.  In the recent past third level colleges have been required to address this gross inequality through the provision of direct access programmes which are still in their infancy.  In 1997 fewer than 50 students gained a place through these programmes.  Reforming the third level grants system would ensure that students from disadvantaged areas could confidently aspire to a third level place without the worry of having to drop out or that they will place an unmanageable burden on family resources. Ensuring students are adequately supported and not cushioned by the grants system is a key element in tackling inequality.</P>
    <P>Education is highly valued in Irish society. Third level education gives thousands of children throughout the country an opportunity to develop to their full potential in an intellectual and social sense.  Beyond these personal benefits the third level system produces graduates with the skills necessary to maintain our economic success of recent years.  The major challenge facing policymakers is how to ensure all sections of society receive their fair share.  Ensuring ordinary PAYE workers and those families which survive on social welfare can afford to send their children to third level is a key element of this process. That is what the motion seeks to achieve.  It is worthy of the support of everyone in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is being debated at a time when the economy is in excellent shape. The riches and new found wealth which come with economic boom can also create some spinoff problems.  In the past year we have engaged in debate on the growing housing crisis in which the first-time buyer and the family on the housing list have featured but there is an added problem in the rental sector.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which have arisen for those who wish to purchase a home mean that they are staying for longer periods in rented accommodation.  Some property owners and landlords have taken advantage of this and increased prices well above the rate of inflation.  The rental cost of some poor quality accommodation is being set at unreasonable rates.  This has the knock-on effect of pushing low-income earners and students out of the rental sector or into substandard accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Student accommodation needs to be addressed in the context of what is happening in the rental sector.  The motion calls for a programme for the provision of good quality student accommodation in universities and institutes of technology involving direct State aid and tax incentives for the private sector.  Most European countries which are pro-education operate accommodation provision programmes for their student population. Ireland has always boasted a quality education <Col N="272" /> system.  If we want to sustain quality, we must make provision to support students.</P>
    <P>There are students standing in telephone boxes with a copy of the <i>Evening Herald,</i> the <i>Evening Echo</i> and others publications making endless calls to landlords.  For some students the new academic term commenced in mid-September and they still have not found an appropriate place to live.  In the small advertisements in tonight's edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> it was difficult not to notice the accommodation strictly reserved for professionals.  Even in those advertisements which were not prefaced with the words &ldquo;professional person required&rdquo; the cost of the accommodation on offer was far beyond that any student could afford.  A shared room in a flat in Ranelagh costs £50 per week while the cost of a single room in a house on the North Circular Road is £260 per month.  The only advertisement placed under the heading &ldquo;Student Accommodation&rdquo; offered a shared bedroom for £160 per month per person but even this is outside the reach of an average student who is attempting to live on a maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>In seeking accommodation at peak times prior to the commencement of the academic term the availability of a parent with a car can make the difference in obtaining affordable accommodation.  This is yet another aspect which places less well-off students at a disadvantage.  I am aware of students who are sleeping on sitting room floors and others who are commuting long distances to and from their parents' homes daily because of the shortage of affordable rented accommodation.  These arrangements are not conducive to studying or to a healthy lifestyle.  A student who has to make a two to three hour journey to college cannot expect to be in a position to do course work.  Living a long distance from college limits access to library and study facilities.  Such students cannot engage in the social aspects of college life.</P>
    <P>While students in Dublin and Galway are suffering the brunt of the accommodation crisis, high rental costs are a concern for all those living away from home.  It is essential, therefore, that all State agencies which have a direct role in third level education, including vocational education committees, universities and the Department of Education and Science, draw up a plan of action to deal with student accommodation needs.  Some universities offer limited accommodation for students but this is merely a drop in the ocean. While on campus accommodation is the most desirable, there is a limit to the amount that can be built, particularly on the older and more developed university campuses.  I praise the University of Limerick for leading the way.  I hope that will be followed in other universities.  It is only what students deserve when they are trying to pursue their third level courses.</P>
    <P>Plans are now in place to demolish a number of housing complexes in Dublin city centre.  In some cases this accommodation is very sound and well constructed.  While much of it is unsuitable for <Col N="273" /> families and older people, consideration should be given to retaining some of it for the purpose of converting it for use as student accommodation. Furthermore, the leader of the Labour Party has pointed out the need to retain the section of hospital accommodation at St. Vincent's Hospital earmarked for demolition.  It could be converted for use as student halls because of its proximity to UCD.  Indeed it could also be used by student nurses who are also suffering from the accommodation crisis.</P>
    <P>However, the welfare of our student population goes deeper than the accommodation crisis. In a society which is trying to encourage young people to complete the education cycle and attain some follow-on education at third level, it is essential we put in place structures and supports which ensure the maximum participation at third level.  It is still the case that only a very small percentage of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make it through third level education.</P>
    <P>When parents assist their children in achieving the qualifications to move to third level education they do not expect them to have to deal with huge financial problems.  The maximum grant for students living away from home is just over £1,600 per year.  A student from a low income family who must live away from home to attend third level college cannot live on this amount of money.  It is not surprising that so many students drop out of college after their first year because they cannot cope financially.  Others must work part-time, which does not give them an equal opportunity to those students who do not have to do so, and this puts them at a disadvantage, which should not arise when students need to devote their time to their studies.</P>
    <P>In an economy where it is easier to secure a full-time job than a place in third level college it is essential we are seen to support those who opt for a qualification.  It is even more important that we encourage young people to participate in third level education.  While the jobs created by the economic boom may be an attractive option for a 17 or 18 year old today, the boom will not last forever and the gloomy prospect of an economic downturn and job losses is never too far away.</P>
    <P>Education is the key to securing a route out of poverty and insecurity, but young people, especially those from disadvantaged areas, will not be attracted to an education system where they are faced with dealing with continuing financial insecurity and poverty.  We in the Labour Party believe in equality of access and opportunity.  If students from disadvantaged areas cannot compete on an equal basis we are not achieving that, which is why we have moved this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and important debate.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, our spokesman on Education and Science, for having the foresight and interest in education to propose this motion.  I represent a midlands constituency <Col N="274" /> which is perhaps equidistant from the colleges in the country.  We are lucky to have a very important college in the constituency, the Athlone Institute of Technology, which is expanding day by day.  It will shortly face accommodation pressures, although this has been streamlined thus far.  Traditionally people from the midlands have studied subjects such as agriculture, veterinary and engineering at Dublin, Galway or Cork.  That has created a major problem.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Minister the matter of the impact of the student maintenance grant on students attending Athlone Institute of Technology.  People living in Ballymore, just less than 15 miles from the college, are not entitled to the grant.  Some of them are on very low incomes and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter. The maintenance grant amounts to £1,652 per annum, which is very small, especially for a family whose parents are on, say, invalidity benefit.  I come from a similar background and I speak on behalf of these people.  My father was only a council worker and his wages were very poor &mdash; approximately £8 per week.  I know the sacrifices parents must make to try to give their children an opportunity.  For example, often two or three members of a family would be capable of going on to third level, yet some would make a sacrifice to promote the chances of another.  Some of my young brothers stayed at home to enable me to go on to third level.  I owe a debt of gratitude to them and to my parents.  However, this should not happen.  The issue of the maintenance grant is very important in County Westmeath, especially given that the Athlone Institute of Technology is such a fine college.  It should be addressed in this time of plenty.</P>
      <P>Many young people have to travel to major cities to avail of third level education.  These students and their families have had to take on board the spiralling increase in the cost of private rented accommodation in the recent past.  In 1974 the council grant was £300 per annum.  We stretched it to last, but at the time a couple of lads could share a flat in Dublin for £2 or £3 per week.  That would not buy a cup of tea today, which is an indication of the increase in the cost of accommodation for young people over the past 20 years.  People are still trying to get accommodation in Dublin for this academic year, indeed some are now trying to commute from home because of the difficulties they have encountered. The underlying problems must be tackled.</P>
      <P>The Minister increased the rate of maintenance grant available to students by 1.7 per cent, from £1,624 to £1,652 per annum.  This is a miserly increase and it does not take account of the real rate of inflation which third level students face when securing private rented accommodation. The increase amounts to 77p per week for those living away from home and 36p for those living at home.  It is miserable and it means that the burden falls on the parents to support their children's education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Some people can afford third level accommodation.  They can also afford private health service and can be in the Blackrock Clinic within 48 hours.  Yet those on medical cards can queue for 18 to 24 months while their hips deteriorate, their orthodontic treatment is not addressed or their knee joints remain out of place.  It is time the Government addressed seriously the rate of maintenance grant and raised it in line with the real cost of living facing students.</P>
    <P>It is also time to calculate grants on net as distinct from gross income.  I have always been a critic of assessment schemes that work from gross income levels.  There was a small movement to assess medical card entitlements on net incomes. The budget last year finally moved the family income supplement on to a net income calculation base.  It is time the Government had the good sense to do the same for third level eligibility grants.  If one is £100 over the eligibility limit one loses everything.  There is no justice in that.  A graduated eligibility limit should apply whereby if one was £100 over one would get 90 per cent of the grant and if one was, say, £1,500 over one would not be entitled to any grant.  It is very unfair that those who have worked overtime are ineligible for maintenance grant for their sons or daughters.</P>
    <P>Education has always been valued in Irish society and our educated population has been a major contributing factor to our recent economic success.  It is vital that we continue to invest in education to maintain economic growth.  The motion proposes a substantial package of reform, especially of the maintenance grant system.  The reforms aim to ensure that children of low and middle income families can avail of third level education and can afford to stay in education until they attain their qualifications.  In short, it is an investment in the future.  The Minister knows we have a highly skilled, adaptable and qualified technology-based workforce which is the envy of the world.  We must ensure all children from whatever background are given an opportunity. Education is a great leveller and transcends all economic classes and boundaries and gives people from my background an opportunity to gain equality.  It is the one way to ensure equality is real and achievable and not imaginary.  I urge the Minister to look at the points I raised positively in a constructive way.  I am not making a major political issue but as someone who went through the system.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Dáil Éireann notes the significant expansion in funding for further and higher education, particularly relating to the creation of extra places, and believes that:</P>
    <P>&ndash; there is a need for increased dedicated student accommodation, and</P>
    <P>&ndash; additional resources for student support should be targeted at increasing participation by the most disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome this second opportunity in two weeks to discuss education during Private Members' time.  In particular, I welcome this opportunity to debate the issue of third level provision support and accommodation.</P>
    <P>Having been attacked by the Opposition last week for spending too much on third level, being attacked this evening for spending too little shows an admirable flexibility on behalf of the Opposition.  I suspect that this creative approach again demonstrates that the Opposition recognises the success of this Government in the area of education generally.</P>
    <P>It is a significant constraint within this House that there is no opportunity for the specific object of Opposition ire to respond at or close to the end of a debate such as this.  Last week I would certainly have been eager to respond to the regrouped party line of the Opposition on Wednesday night.  Those contributions demonstrated without doubt that the Opposition can give it but it cannot take it.  It seems it believes that it is disreputable to expect it to be accountable for its actions in Government only a year and a half ago.  It expects its record to be accepted as a <i>tabula rasa.</i> I assure the Opposition that we have no intention of being deflected by the sort of self-serving attacks which we heard last week.</P>
    <P>The House should note that none of the substantive points which I made in my contribution were refuted.  Instead, most Opposition contributions implicitly admitted their failures by calling events of less than two years ago ancient history.  However, this did not include Deputy O'Sullivan, who was indignant that anyone could dare question the Labour Party's record.  I reassure the Deputy that I was not attacking my predecessor.  The education failures of the Rainbow Government should be laid at the door of the entire Government and not just the then Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we have moved from a debate on targeting educational disadvantage to one on expensive, untargeted and ill-thought out proposals.  There are a number of specific areas included in the Labour Party's motion and I would like to address them all.  Within this, we should take the opportunity to debate wider issues of participation in third level and the long-term requirements of the sector.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the last Government chose specifically to reject the principal recommendation of the Review Group on Student Support concerning third level maintenance grants.  The group, under the chairmanship <Col N="277" /> of Donal de Buitléir, proposed that extra funding should be directed in the first instance at improving grants.  Instead of implementing this, it was decided to concentrate all funding on the abolition of undergraduate fees.  This was certainly a very significant decision, although attempts to compare it with the great expansions in education initiated by Donogh O'Malley and Fianna Fáil were laughable.</P>
    <P>When this abolition was announced we were all informed that the decision would, if I may quote the Labour Party, &ldquo;throw open the gates of higher education to the underprivileged&rdquo;.  This was an initiative which was directly targeted at helping the middle and higher income earners who then paid fees, as opposed to the roughly 50 per cent who had them paid by the State. Allowing for the under-representation of poorer families in higher education, by definition this was an initiative which would very specifically target resources at the better off sections of society.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most ingenious argument used at the time was that, although it was admitted that poorer families would gain nothing by the initiative, it would increase participation through the psychological effects of feeling that third level was now somehow more accessible.  This fundamentally ignored the realities of economic and educational disadvantage and has proven as empty as it sounded in the first place.</P>
    <P>What is incredible is that many grant holders and, therefore, by definition those more in need, actually lost money because of so-called free fees. It was estimated at the time that grant holders could lose between £235 and £280 each because of the removal of covenants.  This conscious cutback in support available to grant holders makes Labour's new love-bombing of students on grants more than a bit surprising.</P>
    <P>Participation in higher education by poorer families has not and will not increase because of this decision.  I have said it before and will say it again: this decision has not helped a single child from the most disadvantaged groups in our society to attend a higher education institution. This conclusion is absolutely incontrovertible.  I will later outline in more detail my views on how we can address under-representation, but it is enough to say at this point that I believe that diversity and appropriateness of provision and targeted interventions are the key and these form the core of this Government's approach to the sector.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that next year the overall cost of meeting tuition fees in third level will be £140 million.  There is absolutely no doubt that this has, heretofore, significantly constrained the ability of my Department to obtain further funding for targeted interventions.  The year 1995 marked a dramatic discontinuity from policies initiated post-1989 and, in particular, saw the brakes being applied to spending in many other areas of education.  I see no other explanation for the proposal in 1997, when the phase out of fees began <Col N="278" /> to be a significant force, to freeze school funding and cut primary teacher numbers.</P>
    <P>These concerns were voiced in the press by Democratic Left at the time of the so-called free fees initiative.  Labour's new partners opposed the abolition of fees it seems because it would be regressive and undermine the ability of the system to properly expand access.  I look forward to it outlining its current views on this matter and whether or not it will endeavour to have the Labour Party reverse its decision once it is firmly within its welcoming bosom.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked me last week to expand on my statement that, while I believe the decision was flawed, I do not believe it should be reversed.  This is quite simple, the opportunity cost at the time could not justify the decision as has been clearly demonstrated since.  However, there are many in middle-income families who have benefited from the decision and rely on it. The de Buitléir proposals at the time would, in all probability, have helped this group, but I do not believe that a system could be found to address their needs were the fees to be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more significantly, we now have a Minister for Finance who recognises the need to invest in other areas of education as well.  With the largest ever increase in primary funding and significant extra funding in a range of areas, this Government has demonstrated that it will make sure that other sectors are not held back because of this one decision.  As such, this Government is dealing with the principal negative effect of the initiative.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House proposes the abolition of the student registration charge.  This represents a remarkable change of mind on behalf of the Labour Party seeing as it is the originator of the charge in the first place.</P>
    <P>It may help if I remind the House that the charge was created at the time of the abolition of fees in order to specifically cover the cost of exams, student services and registration.  Originally set at £150, it was said at the time of its introduction by the then Government that it would be reviewed again after two years.  When I took up office, the two years were up and I received many representations from institutions to say that the cost of these services was, in fact, on average about £400 per pupil per year.  In light of this, I agreed that they could increase the charge by £100.  This was followed by a further 4 per cent increase this year in line with the general rise in fees.  I listened to the proposal put forward by Deputy O'Shea and it seems his proposal would result in a further increase of £140 to the existing charge given the definitions and criteria he outlined.  The House will appreciate that fees still exist and still rise every year, it is just that the State now pays them all.</P>
    <P>The impact of the increase has been to provide a sounder and more secure funding base for the services covered.  I am concerned, and I share those of Members, that progress on implementing <Col N="279" /> a more fully transparent system has been too slow and I have asked students to supply information where difficulties have arisen.  I remind the House that this increase has fallen heaviest on my Department, as it pays the charge on behalf of roughly 50 per cent of students.</P>
    <P>The last Government's attachment to the charge was underlined by the specific inclusion of a provision in the Universities Act to allow the charge.  On a number of occasions the Opposition, and certain student leaders, have sought to present the increases as, in some way, the reintroduction of fees by the backdoor; this is nonsense. Undergraduate fees would now run at roughly £2,000 per student, if still in place.  I assure the House that were they to come back, which they will not, it would be through the front door following a full and honest public debate about third level.  This charge is not paid by roughly 50 per cent of students who receive higher education grants and, therefore, its abolition would benefit only the better off sections of society.  At a cost of £12 million, it seems that the inescapable conclusion from this motion is that the Labour Party is again willing to prioritise the interests of the better off at the expense of others seeking access to education.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls for a range of increases in the student grants scheme.  The total list of measures to which the Leader of the Labour Party signed up on the back of a truck in Molesworth Street would amount to more than £100 million a year.  Grants are paid to roughly 50 per cent of students attending higher education.  As such it could not be described as a targeted measure aimed at helping the poorest of students.  We should aim to increase the income available to students in need but, because of finite resources, we must have priorities and must target those most in need.</P>
    <P>The policy I have followed is to increase payments in line with inflation and increase income limits in line with the average industrial wage. While the Labour Party now finds this inadequate, I would remind it that this is another policy initiated by it.  While de Buitléir recommended some of the changes proposed in this motion, they were rejected by the Labour Party in Government.  Because of this, I find tonight's protestations of concern difficult to take seriously.</P>
    <P>As my party indicated in Opposition, and as the current Opposition rightly points out, it is our belief that significant improvements in the grants scheme are required.  As we pointed out in the relevant discussion document, we also believe in prioritising and that it is reasonable to deliver things across the lifetime of a Government.  It is my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants scheme before dealing with the more general issue of levels.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has not pointed out this evening that we are already implementing our <Col N="280" /> largest single pledge relating to grants by introducing grants for post-leaving certificate students. Estimated to cost almost £16 million next year, these grants will benefit students often from the most modest backgrounds who were for so long neglected by the Opposition.  Even though it was included in the Rainbow Coalition's Programme for Government, PLC students were not given grants and were forgotten as others benefited from the largesse being spread around.  Continuing this policy, tonight's motion again ignores PLC students, perhaps out of a sense of guilt.</P>
    <P>This new grants scheme has involved very complex administrative arrangements and the first payments have been delayed but I assure the House that my officials are doing all they can to ensure that the first payments are issued as soon as possible, I hope within the next six weeks.</P>
    <P>The administration of the overall grants scheme needs attention.  I accept the various recommendations of de Buitléir and I am persuaded by the need to move toward a central grants authority with flexible methods of payment.  This is proving significantly more complicated than I first expected.  In the meantime, I have addressed one of the ongoing problems with the scheme, the problems caused by paying local authorities in arrears.  Because of my move on this, grants have been paid significantly earlier this term.</P>
    <P>I accept that students in many parts of the State are experiencing difficulties in finding good, affordable accommodation and I welcome this opportunity to discuss the issue.  This is a subset of the wider housing squeeze which has been growing in recent years.  As income levels rise, and demand for accommodation rises, students are left competing with people who have greater spending power.</P>
    <P>Because of this, an across the board increase in direct grants would have little direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.  Grants are paid to roughly 50 per cent of students, only some of whom are affected by what is happening to rents.  Increasing grants for all is not a measure targeted at the students in need.  What is described in the motion as an emergency package is a knee-jerk package which at great expense would leave the problem unresolved.</P>
    <P>The core need is to increase the availability of dedicated student housing with a resultant release of pressure on the rented sector.  In Dublin there are almost 3,000 student residences.  These have been developed since the late 1980s through a series of self-financing initiatives.  My officials have held discussions with colleges on this issue and we have signalled our willingness to assist further significant student housing developments. I hope we will be in a position to announce some movement on this shortly.  At this stage direct State aid is not required, though tax relief is likely to play a role.</P>
    <P>This is not a problem which has arisen overnight.  Accommodation is something which, by <Col N="281" /> necessity, cannot be dealt with on a short-term basis.  It is noticeable that the Labour Party's manifesto for the last election did not even mention student accommodation.  In this context, the House will forgive me if I reject the scatter-gun proposal contained in the motion and look instead to the policy which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The feedback we have received from the Higher Education Authority and the colleges is that the problem is concentrated in the Dublin area and is not as acute in the locations of other colleges.  There are 7,000 college residence places provided at the moment by various colleges including the colleges of education.  Limerick and Cork are doing well with 1,700 places, while UCD has 1,472 places.  However, we need to do more, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes a review of policy concerning what is termed the &ldquo;more equitable and rational distribution of student numbers throughout the State.&rdquo;.  In general terms I agree with the idea that we should have a balanced spread of provision through our higher education institutions.  This said, I do not see the potential for redistributing places or disproportionately concentrating future expansions.</P>
    <P>Students coming to Dublin place pressure on the rented sector in the city, but it is not credible to duplicate the provision in its colleges throughout the State.  It would be inefficient and damaging to quality to adopt the &ldquo;one for everybody in the audience&rdquo; approach implicit in the motion.  In addition, Dublin contains the areas with the lowest participation in third level in the State.  It is therefore essential that we increase places in Dublin, particularly at sub-degree level.  It is a matter of some considerable concern to me that it has proved so difficult over the last year to create extra sub-degree places in key areas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government is absolutely committed to making sure colleges throughout the State are given the opportunity to grow.  That is why we have initiated the largest ever third level building programme through the Education Technology Investment Fund.  As a result more students will have the opportunity to study in high quality facilities in their home regions if they wish to do so.  We have already increased the number of third level places by more than 8,000.  Apprenticeship places now stand at 5,500 and in the PLC sector we have increased the numbers by 5,000. That is real access.</P>
    <P>The Government has already implemented its most expensive commitment on grants and will, as resources permit, make further improvements. This said, we are determined to target resources on the issue of broadening and deepening participation in further and higher education.  We are committed to targeting the most disadvantaged groups with the key areas being summed up as access, diversity and progression.</P>
    <P>The promotion of access must deal with tackling disincentives of tradition and support.  In particular, colleges must reach out and additional <Col N="282" /> support should be available where it is needed. Between direct funding from my Department, and indirect funding from the HEA, almost £900,000 is being spent on this area in the current year.  I hope to go significantly beyond this next year.  As part of this I want to deal with the issue of retention in certain parts of the system which seems to relate to background in many cases.  We have already initiated research on the area of attrition and we will have a significant initiative to announce to deal with attrition in third level education.</P>
    <P>A diversity of provision is also essential to expand access.  It is not good enough to concentrate on the supposed high status degree level courses.  A system which is to have any credibility must have a balance and the opportunities provided by any sub-degree level courses are a critical part of any effective plan to promote participation.  I see this sector expanding and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine it.</P>
    <P>I would like to direct the House to a shining example of the benefits of diversity of provision &mdash; the National Certificate in Manufacturing Technology.  This course has already provided 300 people, many of whom are second chance students, with the opportunity to access, through a non-standard route, innovative education and training on the way to a well paid job.  A further 500 places will be available in institutes of technology in January.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the long neglected, much promised and unfunded institute of technology in Blanchardstown will make a major contribution to expanding access and diversity.  The £20 million provided for the first development phase of the institute is in place and is a concrete demonstration of a Government which is delivering in comparison to the last Government which, like a mountain goat, had a loud cry but little wool.</P>
    <P>Ensuring progression between levels is also a key to expanding participation.  The low level of progression at the moment is simply unacceptable and I have said on many occasions that I expect institutions to join the effort to expand its operation. The qualifications Bill, which I will be publishing shortly, will be an important part of guaranteeing routes of progression through further and higher education, which is essential for students suffering educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The problems pointed to in the motion are important and need to be addressed.  This said, the broad scale, untargeted approach to solving the problems is simply not credible.  The net effect of the proposals would be to spend many millions of pounds on once again using limited resources and not helping those most in need. The empty opportunism of the Labour Party is not just to be found in its radical change of position, but in the fact that it is actually calling for the abandonment of policies which it introduced in the first place.  It was the Labour Party which created and enshrined in law the registration charge it now wants to abolish, it was the Labour</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Party which decided to confine grants and income thresholds to limited increases but now wants huge increases, and it was the Labour Party which failed to mention student accommodation in its last manifesto but now wants it to be a priority.</P>
    <P>We need a balanced approach which targets funding at those most in need and deals with the real issue of accommodation in an effective manner.  I am already working with colleges to expand access and address the accommodation issue.  This is the most credible and progressive way to address the concerns of those most in need.</P>

      <P>Admitting that the prosperity of our country has been based on economic success and that as many as possible throughout the country should benefit from education, our focus should be on those who can gain access to education at all levels rather than, as we are doing this week, focusing on those who already have access to education.  It strikes me, having spent last week talking about the very important issue of disadvantage, how quickly the Opposition forgets that and just concentrates on those who have overcome their difficulties and gained access to third level education.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly a problem still exists.  Someone from a higher professional background is seven times more likely to go to college than someone from an unskilled manual background.  We accept that, as do all the colleges.  At a recent graduation ceremony in DCU, the president, Dr. Danny O'Hare, said we should be aiming for a situation where the proportion of young people going to university shall be exactly the same, irrespective of their background.  To accept anything less than this absolute equality would be institutionalised disadvantage and would make it permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of this Government to date is to ensure we are not institutionalising disadvantage or making it permanent.  We are ensuring that people who would never have dreamt of third level education are not being left stuck at the first and second levels but are getting the access and opportunity to break out.  The colleges are making a small effort in this regard but are not doing enough.  I commend the Ballymun BITE programme.  UCD has been working hand in hand with the Southside Partnership, in my constituency, and Trinity College, Dublin, has a south inner city sponsorship programme.  However, this is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is needed to make these people feel comfortable in attending third level education.  The emphasis of the Government on ensuring resources are spent on first and second levels will mean that all <Col N="284" /> people will feel that third level is the natural progression for them.</P>
    <P>Giving students grants to spend on accommodation will not lance the boil.  The real problem is the lack of accommodation, which is a wider issue that has been discussed many times in this House.  There are 70,000 accommodation units in the private sector.  Competition from a wide range of people in the commercial field means there is a general accommodation shortage, even before 30,000 students begin to hit the city of Dublin at the end of September.</P>
    <P>There is a number of ways to help students in this regard.  Colleges used to have very active and efficient accommodation officers who worked to facilitate students but who now do not offer the level of service they could for off campus accommodation.  Students are forced to pay professional bodies £40 or £45 to look at accommodation lists. An accommodation officer, with the backing and authority of the college, could encourage landlords willing to rent to students to register with them, whereas they might be unwilling to register with a commercial body.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a partnership could develop between old age pensioners living alone and students, particularly first year students in Dublin.  I raised this matter before and received considerable support from both students and the elderly, including members of the parliament for the aged.  Old people living alone often feel insecure and worried about their safety and students are unable to find accommodation.  Ne'er the twain met in the past but perhaps there is an opportunity for a college accommodation officer to match the two and to ensure both can benefit at a reasonable rate. The important issue, which the Minister for Education and Science might take up with his colleagues, is that the pensioner would not lose their living alone allowance and associated benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the issue of a proper building programme to be undertaken by the colleges themselves or in conjunction with private sponsorship, which would undoubtedly help the situation.  In the 1970s and 1980s 30 per cent of Trinity College, Dublin, students lived on campus.  Now in the 1990s, because of increased student numbers, only 10 per cent of students can live on campus.  However, that college, in common with other colleges in Dublin, where the main accommodation problem exists, has built a new pharmacy building, a new dental school and a new material science building.  There has been a vast building programme in UCD, including the O'Reilly hall.</P>
    <P>The colleges should use some of their land to build accommodation.  If it is possible to provide a Smurfit graduate business school on prime land or the O'Reilly function hall with support from the private sector, why can the private sector and the State, local authorities and colleges, not work together to provide student accommodation, perhaps based on the Carnegie model which provided libraries throughout the country?  Giving a grant to a student will only benefit that one student; providing accommodation will ensure <Col N="285" /> that future generations can benefit.  There will be no incentive for landlords to decrease the cost of rent as long as students are given more and more money.  There should be a separate landlord registration for those who are willing to rent accommodation to students.  Students only want short leases for 36 weeks of the year.  This would benefit both students and landlords, who are sometimes afraid of the outer bodies.</P>
    <P>The key issues are access to third level accommodation, a building programme instituted by the colleges and the State and more outreach courses, based, for example, on the model of The National University of Ireland Maynooth in the outreach campus in Kilkenny, so that everyone does not have to come to Dublin for their education.</P>

      <P>I support the motion.  Student accommodation in our major towns and cities has reached crisis point, no more so than in Dublin, a city which accounts for 60 per cent of the total student intake at third level.  In recent years, the number of college places has increased by 10,000 and the Government is set to make more places available over the coming years.  However, over the same period, there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of affordable accommodation, a situation which has been accelerated by the measures implemented by the Government earlier this year on foot of the Bacon report.  A number of media stories have highlighted the current situation regarding accommodation.  There have been reports of students sleeping rough and of a German science student sleeping in a tent on the N4.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, the average cost per week for a bedsit is £50, a one bedroomed flat costs approximately £100 and a two bedroomed flat approximately £150.  Rents in the capital have increased by approximately 20 per cent in the past 12 months; at the same time the Minister has increased maintenance grants by a paltry 1.7 per cent to bring them up to £45.90 per week.  This grant does not even pay for rent, never mind ESB, gas and food bills and the cost of college materials which average out at approximately £60 per week.</P>
      <P>How are students surviving with these overheads? Many students miss out on meals to save money.  A USI survey reveals that almost 50 per cent of students skip breakfast at least twice a week.  Many students attempt to reduce the cost of accommodation by moving into grotty and damp basement flats or by increasing the capacity of a flat.  I am aware of a case where a student sleeps on a couch in a bedsit in which two other people share a double bed.  The students pay £30 each per week for this accommodation.  One would think students were living in shanty towns in a Third World country rather than in the capital of the tiger economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Some students are being forced to refuse college places in Dublin and avail of courses in which they are less interested in order to remain nearer home.  Direct intervention is urgently required to provide students with viable housing options.  The amount of campus accommodation available in Ireland is minuscule compared to other EU countries.  A massive building programme is required in the third level sector using public and private funding.  I welcome the Minister's commitment and I hope he delivers on it. Any tax designation which would seriously question the use of tax relief as a method of funding this type of accommodation will be questioned by the EU.  Perhaps a scheme could be considered whereby elderly people would be entitled to take in students at a fixed rent without their pension entitlements being affected.  I hope Deputy Hanafin will encourage the Minister to ensure these suggestions are implemented.</P>
    <P>A radical overhaul of maintenance grants is necessary.  These must be increased in line with accommodation and other costs.  The current income limits must be reassessed.  Students are a long-term investment in ensuring our economy continues to develop in the future.</P>
    <P>Accommodation officers, funded by the various student unions, are available in third level colleges but that is equivalent to putting one's finger in a hole in a dam.  The Government has not done anything to address the problems faced by students on a daily basis and the Bacon report has only served to compound the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone has a right to third level education which in the long-term gives the possibility of full-time employment.  Access to colleges in Northern Ireland and the UK fee-free was a great benefit to the Border area but it is no longer available to us.  I was amused at the Minister disclaiming any involvement in doing away with free fees.  When that occurred, the Fine Gael Party was in Government and one of the Minister's colleagues claimed the abolition of free fees was being forced on the Rainbow Government by the EU.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of grants towards PLCs.  County Monaghan has the third lowest level of take up of third level education, according to the de Buitléir report.  In many cases, children come from low to middle income farm families and families of factory workers in the food and furniture industry.  There is no major third level college available to which students could commute on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>MIFFET, which is run under the VEC, offers the only available post leaving certificate courses and 130 to 150 full-time students participate in that.  Yet, no funds seem to be available to the VEC to purchase accommodation in St. Davnet's complex.  A commitment must be given to extend accommodation for first and second year students, linked up with regional technical colleges and universities, if we are to overcome problems in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> I will outline an example of the need for the Minister to take account of the motion before the House.  I refer to the case of the second child in a family of six children whose parents are small farmers in receipt of social welfare.  The student pays £55 per week for bed and breakfast and £2 per day for bus travel in addition to paying for food.  Her weekend return bus fare costs £7, books cost as much as £45 each and she must also pay a registration fee of approximately £400.  The total grant she receives is £1,624, out of which she must also buy clothes.  She would like to attend the Christmas ball, tickets for which cost £25.  If she did not attend college and remained at home or lived in a flat in her local town, she would cost the State £3,400 in social welfare payments and £1,800 in rent allowance.  She had to get a loan last Saturday as the money she had received to date was spent.</P>
    <P>We must implement a sliding scale to accommodate those who, for one reason or another, fall outside of current structures.  I am aware of someone who was forced to work overtime in his job in the emergency services as a result of which his family became ineligible for any grant payments. Allowances must be made for self-employed people.  I urge the Minister to take account of the motion.  If he does not, the remaining four members of the girl's family will not have an opportunity to avail of third level education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion on the need to review higher education grants immediately. Students and parents from low and middle income families are facing severe difficulties and stresses in providing funds for third level education which have been caused by the rapidly increasing cost of accommodation.  There is an emergency in this area and immediate measures must be taken to alleviate the crisis.  There is an urgent need to substantially increase the eligibility limits for students' maintenance grants; eligibility should be calculated on net rather than gross income as is currently the case.  The Minister for Education and Science increased maintenance grants by 77p per week for a student living away from home and by 36p per week for a student living at home.  It is the understatement of the year to say this is inadequate.  To say it is an insult is nearer to a realistic description of current circumstances.  The Minister should introduce a graduated system of entitlement to maintenance grants, with a substantial increase in the size of the maximum grant available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The USI's poverty survey of 1997-8 showed the average expenditure for students living away from home is £466.24 per month.  Accommodation costs have jumped from an average of £120.19 per month in 1995-6 to £220 per month in 1998.  This indicates a monthly increase of £100 for rented accommodation while the Minister has provided an increase of 77p per week.  Of those surveyed, 74 per cent said the rent did not include the cost of utilities.  Despite the introduction of <Col N="288" /> the 1993 regulations on housing and private rented accommodation, only 34 per cent of students had a rent book while 10 per cent did not know their landlord's name.</P>
    <P>I support the demands the USI is making on the Minister.  I support the immediate and full implementation of the 1993 housing legislation in the context of a workable system for tenants. There should be an immediate investigation into the effectiveness of providing tax incentives for landlords offering accommodation on a short-term basis for those in need of speciality houses, such as students, particularly students with special requirements, including student parents and students with disabilities.  There should be capital investment in on campus accommodation for students.  In this context there should be a joint initiative between the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Education and Science providing financial aid to institutes of education for the development of on campus accommodation with adequate provision being made for students with disabilities and student parents.  USI would like to see the Department of Education and Science taking the lead in this initiative.</P>
    <P>Funding should be provided for a feasibility study into the establishment of a student housing association and, pending the results, investment in the establishment of such a body.  The USI also asks for investigation into the viability of allowing the elderly accommodate students during the academic year without losing benefits such as living alone allowance.  We now know where Deputy Hanafin got her information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is timely.  I was disappointed with the speech of the Minister of Education and Science who seems to be living in a time warp.  This is his second time to come to the House and castigate what happened two years ago.  The failure of the Government to deal with a range of issues, including housing, health, traffic, crime, agriculture and education, is a failure to manage the booming economy it took over from the Fine Gael-led Government.  The Government has failed and is unable to manage the economy. It is necessary to manage in good times &mdash; one cannot sit back and hope everything will be all right, as the Government is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the failure on the part of the Government to manage the housing crisis has led to a massive increase in the cost of accommodation.  It is necessary to prove one is poor before one receives a grant.  This means a person must have little or no income before getting a grant. As an aside I wish to point out that the forms issued by the Department are in need of updating, something the Minister might take on board. They are complicated, complex and off putting. Those who prove they are poor may get a grant. I have been in houses where both parents have to work in order to make ends meet.  Because they both work they are over the income threshold <Col N="289" /> and no grant is given.  I maintain such households are poor.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for an increase in the eligibility levels for grants.  Those who are poor and get a grant have little or no money.  In Cork accommodation costs a minimum of £40 per week, which absorbs the entire grant.  Having proved one has no money in order to get the grant, what does one live on?  There is nothing left to buy food, books, pay ESB and gas bills, etc., and perhaps have some kind of a life.  If a student's family has money to pay for these living expenses then they will not receive the grant in the first place.  Therefore a paradox exists and the motion attempts to address it.</P>

      <P>The issue of distance must also be examined in the context of two people living 200 yards from each other but only one getting a grant.  There is something wrong when this happens, and a graduated scale is necessary.</P>

      <P>The sore point refers to those students who go to university and third level institutions with no previous contact with cities such as Dublin.  There are people from the country who have acquired apartments in Dublin &mdash; some have acquired multiple apartments &mdash; thereby ensuring their children are looked after.  There are also people who have contact, including friends, acquaintances, etc., who either have apartments, flats or access to flats or friends where they can stay.  The problem lies with those who never have had previous contact with the city in that way.  They are at the mercy of and are exposed to the rip-off merchants in what has become rip-off city.</P>
      <P>Students from many parts of the country lose the first quarter of the academic year traipsing around the city night after night looking for accommodation, often dingy, damp, dirty, filthy, vermin ridden bedsits which should be condemned and bulldozed into eternity.  It is not beyond the competence or imagination of Government to ensure the construction industry, in conjunction with the universities, the third level institutions and the Department of Finance, builds county dormitories or introduces county accommodation systems thereby solving the accommodation problems of the section of students who do not have access to friends, acquaintances or apartments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter concerns the future.  On Saturday night the Taoiseach referred to the world class education system in Ireland.  That may be so, but the back-up facility to make it world class and to draw on the imagination and ability of students is not helped by allowing them live in damp, dank, <Col N="290" /> filthy accommodation for which they are charged rip-off prices by rip-off merchants.  The Minister, even if he does nothing else, should ensure the problem is sorted out once and for all.</P>

      <P>This matter is of grave concern to public representatives and the people of County Mayo.  Last Friday notice of closure was given to 36 employees of the Betatherm factory in the town of Ballinrobe, 34 women and two men.  They work a two and a three day week and will finish their employment the week before Christmas.  The factory will close on 31 December.</P>
      <P>Betatherm was established in County Galway in 1987 and set up its factory in 1994 in Ballinrobe in an advance factory.  It was greeted in the community as great news at the time because it was difficult to attract industry into the area and it had a significant impact in the local community. Betatherm is a manufacturer of temperature control thermostats for the automotive business.  The reasons given for the closure are lost contracts, problems in the UK, the financial crisis in Asia and marketing problems which the company has experienced in the US.  I understand either factories or jobs have been lost in the company's factories in the US in Barbados and Florida.</P>
      <P>I visited this factory some years ago when it was in full flight but not during the past weekend when there were photographers around and great publicity was being given to some members of the Opposition.  The workforce was very loyal and there was good morale in the company.  It will be a great loss to the town of Ballinrobe.  For some extraordinary reason, Ballinrobe has not attracted jobs for many years.  Up to 1994 there were few industrial jobs in the town.  I find this hard to understand given that it is close to Galway.  There is plenty of room for development in Ballinrobe both industrial and residential.</P>
      <P>The company has informed its employees it will assist them in every way possible to find new employment.  I would like details of how exactly it plans to assist its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with whom I spoke on Friday, for getting in touch with IDA Ireland so swiftly and asking it to redouble its efforts in finding replacement employment for County Mayo.  Redoubling its efforts is not enough.  We need to set up a taskforce immediately.  On an absolute scale, the loss of 36 jobs may not seem large to constituencies where there have been hundreds of job announcements recently.  To the town of Ballinrobe it is very significant.  I want the town of Ballinrobe prioritised <Col N="291" /> by the Tánaiste and IDA Ireland as a location for the next new factory that comes to this country.</P>
    <P>Scarcely has a week has gone by, since we assumed office, where there has not been some new job announcement somewhere throughout the country.  I want the next one to be in Ballinrobe.  The Tánaiste has proved to be successful in this area previously.  In my second day here, the announcement of the closure of Asahi resulted in action by the Tánaiste when she prioritised north Mayo and particularly the town of Ballina for a new factory.  We have managed to attract one of the top 20 countries in the world, Coca Cola, into Ballina.  I ask the Tánaiste to put the same effort into doing something for Ballinrobe.  While the loss of 250 jobs in Asahi was a crisis in north Mayo, the loss of 36 jobs in Ballinrobe is also a crisis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to set up a meeting immediately between herself, IDA Ireland, the Ballinrobe Traders' Association and the staff of Betatherm to show them and the people of Ballinrobe she is serious in her efforts to do something.  We cannot argue that the jobs are not there.  During the past two years while we have been in Government, 100,000 new jobs have been created.  All I am asking is that the 36 employees of Betatherm in Ballinrobe have an opportunity to have their jobs replaced at a time when our economy is booming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>During my term as Minister for Tourism and Trade I dealt with a number of similar instances.  Given Ireland's island location, our population structure and our ability to manufacture high-tech components, exports are important.</P>
      <P>I regret the way the closure of Betatherm in Ballinrobe was handled.  The company should have been more open with its employees when the difficulty became apparent and the company had to go on a three day week.  I sympathise with the workforce and understand their frustration and disappointment in the run-up to the Christmas festivities but sympathy is of little use to the workforce.  There is no sympathy in the world of business economics and trading manufacturing components.</P>
      <P>This company has decided to close.  I am not sure it could have continued given that there was a buy-out, that the manufacturing took place in Barbados, testing took place in Ballinrobe and the product was exported to the Continent.  While I sympathise with the workers, I hope out of this disappointment we can create a new beginning.  I support the concept of setting up a Government-backed task force to deal with this given that a number of them have proved successful in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Betatherm is gone and will not return.  The company has assured me, following my visit on Monday, it will do whatever is necessary in the context of drawing up a redundancy package for the workers.  I hope the redundancy payments will <Col N="292" /> be reasonable and that the workers receive the full amount.  Ireland is no longer a low labour cost country.  Labour costs in Barbados and in South-East Asia are one-third and one-eleventh, respectively, of what they are here.  We face problems on a number of fronts.  Betatherm is not the first electronics company to face this problem and it will not be the last.</P>
    <P>We are very successful in the software industry and in the areas of high level engineering, multilingual skills and so on.  This workforce which is efficient and reliable has the capacity to be retrained.  There will be an opportunity to expand that workforce, given a range of opportunities leading to longer term employment and a high rate of payment.</P>
    <P>From speaking with IDA Ireland today, I am aware that already companies are interested in this plant and I hold out great hope in that context.  One of the best examples of commitment to Ballinrobe is by the McHale engineering plant on the other side of the town which is constructing a 100,000 square foot unit.  This is a locally based indigenous engineering firm, which has a long-term commitment to its 100 employees, involved in heavy machinery and exporting to 27 countries.</P>
    <P>Ballinrobe has had £40 million expended on it in the past ten years in water, sewage, telecommunications, roads, public lighting, fire brigade services and so on.  Some 30 miles from Galway, it is an attractive location for longer term industry and long-term development.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, not just to read the prepared script from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but to give his consent to setting up a task force.  I advise the Minister to appoint Mr. Des Mahon, the county manager, as chairman.  He was very successful in the post-Asahi task force.  Its membership should comprise Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the south Mayo Leader group, FÁS, local employment groups, Forbairt, Teagasc, the Lakeland Development Agency, local industry and local traders.  I would go so far as to suggest the inclusion of local councillors Burke, Mangan and Heneghan on that task force.  If we all work in the interests of Ballinrobe and the greater region, the opportunity will present itself to create a new future for these workers and for the Ballinrobe region.  I ask the Minister of State and the Tánaiste to consent to setting up this task force and to ensure it reports before the end of January.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As someone from the west I share fully the Deputies' disappointment over the recent decision by Betatherm to close its Ballinrobe plant.  I am very conscious of the effect which the closure of this plant will have on Ballinrobe and more immediately on the employees concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Betatherm Corporation, a private company, <Col N="293" /> was established in the United States in 1983 and since then, in addition to its US operation, it has set up plants in the Caribbean and Ireland.  Its manufacturing operations are engaged in the production of thermistors, which are electrical components used for temperature sensing in a wide range of industries such as the medical, industrial, consumer goods, automotive and computer areas. As the Deputies have stated, Betatherm Ireland Limited was established in Galway in 1987 to manufacture thermistors for the medical, consumer and industrial markets in Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1994, a second manufacturing operation was established in an IDA advance factory at Ballinrobe, County Mayo, to manufacture thermistors for the automotive industry.  However, the current financial crisis in Asia has seen a flood of product on to the market at knock-down prices and there has also been a 30 per cent dip in world markets, which has been acknowledged by both Deputies in their contributions.</P>
    <P>Against the deteriorating market situation, the Ballinrobe plant was put on week by week notice and on Friday 20 November staff were informed that the facility would be closed, resulting in the loss of 37 jobs.  The Ballinrobe operation, which has primarily carried out test work, will now be switched to automatic testing and housed in the company's Galway plant.  While it may be of little consolation to the Ballinrobe workers, I am told that Betatherm Ireland is confident for the future of its Galway operation.</P>
    <P>The House will realise that while the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment, which Deputy Kenny would understand from his time as Minister, and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which a company positions itself.  I am particularly conscious of the impact, both economically and socially, of the job losses at Betatherm.  The development agencies are working closely with industry and local interests to promote industrial development in the Mayo area through the attraction of new industry and the expansion of existing industry.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note for the area, earlier this year the Tánaiste announced that 200 new jobs are to be created at Volex Limited in Castlebar in an expansion to establish the Castlebar facility as the centre of excellence within the Volex Group for cable assemblies for the data communications and telecommunications markets in Europe.  This year also, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, as part of the company's expansion programme, has actively recruited for its eye care products a manufacturing facility at Westport.</P>
    <P>In light of the closure of Betatherm's operation in Ballinrobe, I have asked the agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional investment, job creation and job maintenance in the region.  In addition, FÁS will do everything possible to assist redundant workers through initiatives such as training and retraining.  Given the co-ordinated efforts by the agencies on the ground, I consider that the setting up of a task force is not necessary in this case.  I appreciate the case made by the Deputies.  Task forces have been established <Col N="294" /> in other parts of the country where problems like these have arisen.  I assure the Deputies that rejection of the idea of a task force does not mean that every effort will not be made.  The Tánaiste and I will closely monitor the efforts of the agencies involved in this matter.</P>

      <P>The first query stated that as he had leased all of his permanent milk quota entitlements, under the provision of regulation 4 of the Community's 1995 milk quota, Statutory Instrument 266/95, he had leased all his lands to which the milk was attached.  The farmer was to note that under paragraph 3 of the regulation, milk was attached to lands, which defined the lands used for milk production as any area used for maintaining a milk production enterprise including any land used as pasture for cows producing milk and replacement heifers land used for production for feeding to a herd.</P>
      <P>The farmer's application for a quota to the Department in 1991 indicated that his total holding consisted of 54 acres, and he was required to explain how he formed the view that his entire milk quota attached to less than 28 acres of land of a total of 54 acres.  The farmer responded that 26.74 acres of land was adequate to produce 24,557 gallons of milk as it was of excellent quality.  The Department stated that despite the fact he had leased all his dairy lands, he had continued to produce milk for delivery to Kerry Agribusiness &mdash; during the period 1 April 1998 to 30 September 1998 he supplied over 22,000 gallons to Kerry Agribusiness and the Department required him to outline in detail the lands he used to produce this milk, as he had leased all of his dairy lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer replied that he had leased 13 acres &mdash; folio number 645 &mdash; from one person, 16 acres &mdash; folio number 13940 &mdash; from another person and the remainder of his own land, 16 acres, was used to produce 22,000 gallons of milk.  The Department also required confirmation of the identity of a person operating lands leased to another named person.  The farmer's reply supplied a person's full name and address and went <Col N="295" /> on to state that there were sheep on the farm. The farmer believed the farm was to be used for tilling in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Department's other queries were also answered in a positive manner and all queries were responded to in writing.  The financial institutions are pressing the farmer concerned, who did not get a positive response from the Department in the last ten days on the transfer of the quota from Kerry Agribusiness to Golden Vale. I appeal to the Minister of State for a positive response so that this man can secure his family farm for his children, as the financial institution will be moving in on him before the weekend.</P>

      <P>The transaction in question relates to an application to transfer quota on foot of a land and quota lease agreement to Golden Vale plc from Kerry Agribusiness Limited.</P>
      <P>The provisions covering the transfer of land and quota are contained in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1998, Statutory Instrument 266/95.  Under these regulations a producer who wishes to transfer all of his quota must transfer all the lands to which the quota is attached.  Furthermore, the lessee must take over the operation of the leased lands in order that the quota can be validly transferred.  My Department's investigations in relation to this transaction are still ongoing, and no decision can be made on the application until it is established that all the relevant provisions of the regulations mentioned above are adhered to by both parties to the lease agreement.</P>
      <P>My Department has to confirm in particular that the amount of quota being transferred by way of this lease is available to the lessor in the current quota year.  It might be useful if the supplier in question contacted the relevant division of my Department with a view to arranging a meeting to discuss the issues involved in the interests of trying to save his farm.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue now as the deadline for the abolition of duty free sales is next year.  It is essential the Government keeps up pressure in Europe to ensure that deadline is extended.  This battle can be won and it must be won in the interest of protecting jobs.  The argument to abolish duty free sales was made unanimously by the Finance Ministers in the context of the completion of the internal market, but the position has changed given that the internal market has not been completed in the anticipated timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> There is a logical argument for retaining duty free sales, particularly in the context of creating and maintaining jobs which is the main priority of the EU.  There is no doubt a sizeable number of direct and indirect jobs will be lost if duty free sales are abolished next year.  It can be logically argued that EU countries need time to develop policies to respond to the economic and social consequences of the abolition of duty free sales.  A majority of European countries appear to be coming around to this view and it is not outside the bounds of argument that in the interest of maintaining jobs we could persuade all the countries concerned to come around to this view.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues including, Deputy Ryan and Bernie Malone, MEP, have raised this issue and Senator Joe Costello raised it with Mr. Santer in the Seanad last week.  As a representative from the mid-west, the Shannon region is particularly vulnerable in this regard.  Shannon Airport is in a precarious position and it must remain competitive.  It is in a more peripheral location than Dublin Airport, which has a large population and a capital city on which to depend.  It is essential Shannon Airport remains competitive to carriers and to passengers.  Duty free sales is an important mechanism for keeping down costs because it raises funds for airports and ensures that the costs to carriers and to passengers are not prohibitive. In the interest of maintaining direct and indirect jobs in the mid-west region and along the west coast, it is essential duty free sales are maintained.  It was indicated that the Committee of the Regions in Europe fully supports the retention of duty free sales for a period.</P>
    <P>At the behest of the Transport Ministers &mdash; and I acknowledge the part played by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; the Commission has undertaken a study.  The abolition of duty free sales would have adverse consequences in a number of EU countries, and it is beginning to realise that now.  There has been a change of attitude in France and Germany.  Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Holland have been supportive and Scandinavian countries are beginning to realise that this is an important issue.  This battle can be won and it is essential the Government keeps up the pressure to enable us retain jobs that are dependent on duty free sales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue put forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan. Coming from Kerry South, which has benefited greatly from access to air access, I am acutely aware of the importance of duty free sales and the benefit it brings in terms of maintaining affordable fares for those who wish to travel by air.  I am concerned about those working in airports, particularly those employed in small regional airports, including those employed in my nearest airport, Farranfore.  In terms of revenue, duty free sales are vital for the survival of Farranfore Airport.  The income from duty free sales <Col N="297" /> contributes to 25 per cent of the wages of the employees in that airport and its abolition would bring into question not only the jobs of those dependent on the sale of duty free goods, but the future sustainability and viability of Farranfore Airport.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation mooted a proposal to introduce a tourist entrance tax of £3 accompanied with a hike in air fares which would result from the abolition of duty free sales.  That tax would have a devastating effect on the tourism industry in Kerry.  It is vital the Government adopts a policy to sustain our regional airports.  Farranfore Airport is Kerry's link to Europe.  As the EU moves towards greater convergence, there is a need to maximise the infrastructural access to isolated areas.  Duty free sales are essential to the sustainability of regional airports and I urge the Government to ensure they are retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is unable to reply to this matter because he is preparing for next week's budget.  Once again this House by way of this Adjournment matter has shown great interest in the question of duty free sales for EU travellers after 1999.  It is an interest unparalleled in any other EU Parliament.  The continuing debates in the Dáil Chamber and in the Seanad reflect the continuing and unique efforts of the Irish, and especially by the Irish Government, to have the decision on duty free sales reversed and to support the efforts of those employed in the affected sectors.</P>
      <P>On the basis of decisions already taken, duty free sales for EU travellers will end at the end of June 1999.  Ireland has raised this issue at various levels over the years.  Not alone have we continually called for an EU wide study, but we have also called for a basic rethink.  Other than Ireland, only Finland, at a transport meeting some years ago, has ever raised the issue in a relatively positive way at any Council, and that point needs to be emphasised.  Ireland has raised it often at all levels, and at various EU Councils, including at the European Summit.  Finland has since moved to the negative camp and does not support retention of duty free sales beyond 1999.  Perhaps this is in solidarity with the general Scandinavian approach which favours high tax and restrictive alcohol and tobacco policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991-2 decision to end duty free sales was confirmed by the Commission at ECOFIN on 19 May 1998 and supported by the majority.  The Commission was strongly supported by a number of member states, who did not wish to see the original decision revisited.  At the 19 May meeting, however, a number of countries gave support for the first time to the Irish call for a study, in particular Germany and France.  The Government has changed in Germany and there are strong reports that Germany will raise the issue again during the Germany Presidency, which will <Col N="298" /> run from 1 January to 30 June 1999, and we would very much welcome that.  We need a new singer to sing the Irish duty free sales song.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has written to his new German colleague on this matter, as he has to several other EU Finance Ministers in recent weeks.  As yet he has not had a reply to his letters seeking support for a change of heart.  I do not doubt, however, that a German initiative will be very useful, when it comes.  It still requires a Commission proposal, and unanimous agreement. However, the EU Commission shows no signs of changing its mind on this subject.</P>
    <P>In advance of the May ECOFIN meeting, the Minister visited Knock, Shannon, Kerry, Cork and Dublin Airports to meet the staff, management, trade union and worker directors to explain the issues, the difficulties we faced and the efforts we were making in relation to duty free sales.  In Cork he also met representatives of the ferry operators.  At those meetings he stressed that transport workers, who of necessity have great contact with travellers, and strong links with workers in other countries, could have a major role to play in changing the minds of people in Europe on this topic.  The Minister recently again met the local duty free sales organisers to co-ordinate our approach and he has also met the Aer Rianta worker directors.</P>
    <P>They reported on their meeting with Commissioner Monti, which did not produce a meeting of minds.  The worker directors subsequently visited Portugal and Denmark to lobby on this issue and they have kept us informed about their deliberations.  They found a more sympathetic hearing in Portugal than they did in Denmark, where the trade union movement supports the abolition of duty free sales.</P>
    <P>During the summer Monsieur Capet reported to the French Prime Minister.  Monsieur Capet represents the Pas de Calais region and he suggested that the decision should be revisited.  His proposal has not got much attention as yet but it reflects further concern about the impact of the decision in another member state.</P>
    <P>On 2 October the European Commission clarified how the value added tax, VAT, and excise duty rules should be applied to sales to intra-EU air and ferry travellers from 1 July 1999, when duty free sales to travellers within the European Union will be abolished.  The Commission confirmed that existing excise duty legislation means that sales on board ships and aircraft on journeys within the EU will be subject to the excise duty at the rate applied by the country where the goods are loaded.  With regard to VAT, the existing rules provide for taxation to be applied at the rate of the member state of departure.  It also reaffirms that under existing legislation voyages from one member state to another are considered to be intra-EU voyages as with sales subject to VAT <Col N="299" /> and excise duty, even if the ferry or aircraft crosses international waters or airspace.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the international duty free trade lobby group has organised a tour of European ports and airports for journalists to seek to change opinion.  I assure the Deputies that the <Col N="300" /> Government will continue its efforts to support the duty free case in Europe and the detailed information I have given in this debate bears testimony to that resolve.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 November 1998.</P>

      <P>The review to which the Deputy is referring &mdash; Priorities For Progress: Towards A Fairer Future &mdash; has just been published by the Conference of Religious of Ireland. The study is addressed to a wide audience, not just to the Government but also to all political parties, social partners and policy makers.  It has identified a national purpose &mdash; full citizenship for all people of Ireland &mdash; and proposes a new strategic approach to achieve this purpose.</P>
      <P>The review is concerned with tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion and these objectives also form the cornerstone of Government economic and social policies.  These issues are being addressed across the whole range of public policy.  In addition, they are the subject of ongoing consideration by the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, set up under the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS.</P>
      <P>Concerning my Department, the main issue identified is that of basic income, which CORI has been advocating for some time.  Under such a proposal, every person in the country would be entitled, as a right, to a weekly basic income payment from the State.  This would be paid without any means test, and regardless of family circumstances or labour force status.</P>
      <P>The concept of basic income was examined by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare system which reported in June 1996.  The expert group did not recommend a full basic income on the basis that the tax rates needed to fund it could have a deleterious effect on employment.  The group noted that this could change in the future, depending on a number of factors.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out an independent appraisal of the concept of, and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment.  A broadly based steering group for this project has been established under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Government is also committed to producing a Green Paper on the issue.  Research currently being commissioned by the steering group will be an important input into that paper.</P>

      <P>I am acutely aware of the difficulties being experienced by the farming community at the present time.  Accordingly, field staff have been advised that, while farm income is normally assessed on the basis of the preceding year, the current pressures require that account be taken of the prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that new claims for unemployment assistance made by smallholders are being dealt with expeditiously.  Bearing in mind that each individual applicant must be interviewed to ascertain his-her particular circumstances, I am satisfied that there is no undue delay on the part of my Department in processing such cases.  There are no indications of a significant increase in the level of requests for review of entitlement over recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Separate statistics are not available in respect of unemployment assistance appeals made by smallholders, which are processed in the same manner as other appeals in this category. However, as every appeal case must be given full and satisfactory consideration, there is an inevitable time lapse inherent in the process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department administers a range of schemes and initiatives designed to help unemployed people return to work or to broaden their vocational skills through various education, training and work experience options. The provision of information to eligible people is an integral part of the administration of these schemes.  The approach taken is based on the provision of information directly to all unemployed people, as well as general advertising and a close working liaison with a variety of relevant statutory and voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Procedures are in place to ensure that people entering the live register are given basic details of the options which are, or may become, available to them.  Further information is provided at appropriate intervals, for example, as the person concerned approaches the eligibility stages for <Col N="303" /> the various education or work schemes.  I might also mention that, in accordance with the national action plan for employment, all people under 25 years of age are referred to FÁS when they are on the live register for six months for detailed appraisal of their training needs and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a dedicated employment support unit based primarily on a network of job facilitators and regional co-ordinators who interact with unemployed people and lone parents in relation to all of the options available to assist them in returning to work or setting up self-employment ventures, including those delivered by other agencies.  These officers offer advice and assistance, including, where necessary, support towards training, the preparation of business plans and the acquisition of loans, etc.</P>
    <P>The Department publishes a variety of information leaflets and booklets covering employment support schemes.  It also provides substantial financial assistance towards the cost of information packs and booklets published by other organisations, including the INOU's &ldquo;Working for Work&rdquo; booklet and the NSSB's &ldquo;Getting Back to Work&rdquo;.  Grants are also provided annually to both the INOU and ICTU to support their respective welfare rights and information services.</P>
    <P>The importance of information for employers is also recognised and an information booklet was produced in consultation with the Small Firms Association, ICTU and the INOU.  Arrangements are being made to have this information updated and re-issued in the near future.  Information provided by means of an annual mailshot to over 140,000 registered employers also contains details of schemes of relevance to those wishing to expand their workforce such as the PRSI exemption scheme, family income supplement and back-to-work allowance.</P>
    <P>A nationwide promotion campaign was undertaken in September of this year to further increase awareness and to demonstrate that, with the aid of the various support schemes, people can be better off at work.  This was based on a distribution of 300,000 copies of a newsletter to unemployed people and relevant organisations and agencies, and supported by an advertising campaign using the provincial press and local radio.  All of the relevant supports from various agencies were covered in this campaign and every effort was made to ensure that close working relations with other agencies are further strengthened.  Other matters, such as the improvements in the method of calculating FIS using net rather than gross pay were also widely advertised in the national press.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the importance of having quality information available to potential participants and will continue to vigorously promote awareness and understanding of the various options.  In this regard, I welcome the broad thrust of the INOU's proposals and we will continue <Col N="304" /> to work with that organisation and others to ensure that people get the full benefits of the various supports on returning to work or to further education.</P>

      <P>The liability to maintain provisions in social welfare legislation impose a general obligation on spouses to maintain each other and their children, and on parents to maintain their children.  In the event of separation or unmarried parenthood, the provisions require spouses or parents, known as &ldquo;liable relatives&rdquo; to make regular contributions towards the cost of providing social welfare income support for their families.  The rationale underlying these provisions is that, if lone parent families require support through a social welfare payment because of inadequate maintenance, then the State is entitled to recover an appropriate amount from the liable relatives concerned.</P>
      <P>In general, I am satisfied that the system operates in a fair manner and strikes a reasonable balance between the income position of the liable relative and their obligations to contribute towards the maintenance of their former spouses and children.  The assessment is based on the income of the liable relative net of taxes and other statutory deductions and in determining the amount to be contributed, allowances are made for living expenses, mortage or rent, any maintenance orders being honoured already, and for any dependent children living with the liable relative. Furthermore, there is an over-riding limitation on the amount of contribution to be paid to the Department by a liable relative.  This method is intended to realistically assess the ability of liable relatives to contribute, while maintaining the social welfare income position of the one-parent family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to make any fundamental change to the way the liable relative contributions are assessed, but I am considering the question of formalising the current administrative arrangements by regulations, including the introduction of an appeals procedure, through the independent Social Walfare Appeals Office, for determination in this area.  I also intend to provide for <Col N="305" /> the pursuit of liable relatives who default on their contribution obligations, by court proceedings if necessary.</P>
    <P>Regarding liability systems in other countries, including the United Kingdom, the Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to make comparisons because of the different legal and social security systems in the various countries, and because of differing social norms and trends.  In this country the relevant provisions are being implemented in the context of Irish family law and of the particular forms of social welfare support for separated and unmarried one-parent families applicable here.  Nonetheless, I intend to keep the provisions under review and to take note in this connection of the implications for the Irish system of research on the arrangements which apply elsewhere.</P>

      <P>This Government has pledged itself to achieving a society based on social inclusion, and to addressing the structural causes of poverty as it affects a significant minority in our society.  This is reflected in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  A key element to achieving this is the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS.</P>
      <P>Administrative structures have been put in place to ensure the efficient implementation of NAPS.  These include the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, including local development, chaired by the Taoiseach, which now meets on a regular monthly basis.  The Cabinet subcommittee reviews the strategies which are in place to deal with poverty and exclusion and provides strong leadership for the strategy; the senior officials' social inclusion group which supports the work of the Cabinet subcommittee; The NAPS interdepartmental policy committee, which comprises senior officers who have responsibility for ensuring that the NAPS provisions relevant to their Departments are implemented; the NAPS unit based in my Department which co-ordinates the implementation of the strategy; and, the NAPS liaison officers in relevant Government Departments fulfil a communication and co-ordination role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Baseline documents were submitted by Departments earlier this year giving an outline of each Department's programmes and initiatives impacting on the area of poverty and social inclusion. Departments prepared workplans for 1998.  They have now been asked draw up an annual report for the interdepartmental policy committee setting out their Department's progress on the NAPS.  These reports will form the basis for the <Col N="306" /> interdepartmental policy committee's report to the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs which will give an overview of the progress which has been made on NAPS across Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has an evaluation role in the NAPS process, including consideration of the views and experience of the voluntary and community sector.  The agency has been working closely with my Department in progressing the NAPS.</P>
    <P>It has for example, played a key role in the recent introduction of a mechanism to ensure that all significant policy proposals are assessed for their impact on those in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum has responsibility for monitoring the social inclusion element of Partnership 2000 and in that context will be specifically asked to report on the progress on implementing the NAPS.  The forum has recently been reconstituted and will be pursuing its role in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The pre-budget submission made by the Combat Poverty Agency, entitled Investing in Children, proposes that the key priority of the forthcoming budget should be the needs of children. The social welfare components of this submission would cost at least £469 million in a full year.  In relation to child benefit, the agency proposes that the lower rate of child benefit should be increased by £15; that the higher rate be increased by £10 and that the higher rate payment be extended to the second child, rather than to the third and subsequent children as is currently the case.  The cost of implementing these proposals is estimated at £204 million in a full year.  The agency also suggests that some of these costs could be offset if child benefit were to be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, I share the concerns of the agency in relation to the need to provide for the needs of children.  However, the level of increase suggested by the agency is substantial, and the <Col N="307" /> cost of over £200 million is high in the context of the resources which are available and the many other demands on these resources.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputies will accept that there is widespread agreement that child benefit is one of the more effective mechanisms available for the provision of child income support.  It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to the main carers of children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    <P>Child income support policy in recent years has therefore sought to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  That was the approach taken in recent years.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in the 1998 budget were targeted especially at the larger families, who are at greatest risk of poverty.  With effect from September 1998, the rates of child benefit were increased by £1.50 for the first two children and by £3.00 for the third and subsequent children, bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.00.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I am not in a position to reveal to the House what the Government has in mind in relation to the further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  That is a matter which is being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This applies to long-term payments, such as pensions, only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is <Col N="308" /> more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>This policy direction has been continued by this Government through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  From September of this year, the rates of child benefit were increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3.00 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.00.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 54, 296, 298 and 304 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.  There are over 11,000 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance at an estimated annual cost of £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the Carers' Association on a number <Col N="309" /> of occasions and I am aware of its views, concerns and priorities in relation to carers.  It has also met the working group on the review of the carer's allowance.  In addition, it attended and made a submission at the pre-budget forum which was organised by my Department to give voluntary organisations the opportunity to have a meaningful input into the budgetary process.</P>
    <P>In its An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was launched by me last month.</P>
    <P>The review puts forward a number of specific proposals in relation to the carer's allowance for consideration.  The review considers that these proposals, at a total full-year cost of almost £16 million would, if implemented, remove certain inconsistencies in the carer's allowance and considerably improve the overall situation for an estimated 11,000 to 12,000 carers.</P>
    <P>The review examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need.  The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the most generous means-tested payments, in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed that the specific proposals in relation to the carer's allowance will be examined further in the context of the 1999 budget as will the issue of the rate of payment.</P>
    <P>The review considered that a needs assessment, encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced.  This would separate care needs from income support and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs of grants to those in need of care. The Government has agreed that a working group, to be chaired by Dr. Tom Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children and also comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the health boards and other relevant Departments be set up to advance this proposal as quickly as possible.  This is currently being progressed by the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>An amount of £40 million is provided in my Department's 1998 Estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus to recipients of long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The bonus payment will amount to 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20, similar to the bonus paid in 1997 and in earlier years and payment will be made in the first week of December.</P>
      <P>This payment will be made to 715,000 long-term social welfare recipients in receipt of disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, widow's and widowers's contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus is payable to recipients of long-term social welfare schemes.  People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments, such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance at the short-term rate are not eligible and I have no plans at the present time to enable recipients of short-term schemes to qualify.  Any extension of the Christmas bonus along those lines would have substantial cost implications for the payment of this bonus this year and in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>Almost 13,000 appeals were dealt with by the social welfare appeals office in 1997.  The average time taken to process all of these appeals was 22 weeks.  This has been reduced to 21 weeks over the first ten months of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The average period given includes all phases of appeals including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.  There is an inevitable time-lag inherent in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
    <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of information supplied by the appellant and the Department's deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing and these take less than the average time.  Where, however, an oral hearing is required, and additional delay is inevitable.  While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, it is a major objective of the office to achieve further improvement in these times subject to the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.  To this end, four additional appeals officers were appointed during the second half of 1997 and, while the numbers of appeals is increasing, this is bringing about an improvement in processing times and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Jobs facilitators form the core of my Department's employment support service.  The service, which was established in 1993 at a time when the level of unemployment was increasing, was intended to support and encourage unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to take up employment or self-employment and to help in directing available employment, training and educational opportunities to them.  The back-to-work allowance was introduced at the same time as a specific incentive for long-term unemployed people to ease the transition back into the active workforce.</P>
      <P>The range of supports which job facilitators could provide has expanded over the years.  My Department currently has 30 jobs facilitators operating at local level throughout the country. In addition there are ten co-ordinators at regional level to whom the job facilitators report and a central support unit for the employment support service generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jobs facilitators have been particularly successful <Col N="312" /> in encouraging over 40,000 unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment opportunities with the support of the back-to-work allowances and providing or arranging for additional supports where required.  The work of the facilitators, together with the efforts made by my Department's local office and investigative staff has, in my view, contributed significantly to the major reduction in the live register which has been achieved in recent times.  It is my intention that these efforts will be intensified and that a proactive approach aimed at helping unemployed people back into employment, training, education, etc., will continue to be a central feature of the Department's service to clients.  Improved co-operation which other staff agencies such as FÁS and the Local Employment Service will be an important feature of this approach.</P>
    <P>I am certainly considering how best the range of my Department's services for unemployed people should be developed in the future in the light of the current improving employment situation and will be considering the role of the job facilitators in that context with a view to ensure that available resources are used in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <P>Since its inception, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, has met on nine occasions and has met three times since Dáil Éireann rose for the summer recess.  During this period, the Government approved the introduction of a mechanism for poverty-proofing all significant policy proposals. As a result of this development, policy proposals must now state clearly the impact of the particular proposal on groups known to be in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.  This provision has now been incorporated into the new Government procedures instructions handbook which has been circulated to all Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs itself plays an important role in regard to the overall implementation of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS.  The Committee &mdash; which first met in October 1997 &mdash; was set up specially by the Government to provide a focus on anti-poverty action at the highest level.  Apart from providing political direction to the development of the strategy, it oversees social inclusion <Col N="313" /> initiatives at a strategic level in the context of the five key themes of the NAPS, namely educational disadvantage, unemployment, rural poverty, disadvantaged urban areas and income adequacy. The remit of the committee also extends to the national drugs strategy and matters relating to local development.</P>

      <P>As part of the employment action plan for under 25s signing on the live register, FÁS is referring back to my Department those cases where a claimant failed to attend for interview with FÁS.  My Department then calls each such person for interview to ascertain the reasons he or she failed to attend and where necessary to review continuing entitlement to receipt of an unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of those who fail to attend for interview do so because they have found employment or re-entered the educational system or taken up a training course in the meantime.  A number have transferred to other schemes and a proportion cease signing without giving any reason.  As the scheme only began in September and the fallout from the later September referrals to FÁS were still being processed in my Department during October, and indeed are continuing, final figures are not yet available to give a complete picture of the full outcome of the first month's caseload.  However, I can say that of those who were still signing, some 50 per cent were rescheduled for interview by FÁS and a further 20 per cent have had their payment suspended while their continuing entitlement is reviewed.</P>
      <P>While we are still in the early stages of operating the new measures, it is already clear that they are very successful and I am satisfied that the plan will provide both the encouragement and the means for under 25s to participate actively in, and improve their chances of getting, work.</P>

A comprehensive customer training programme is currently being delivered to all local office front-line staff. This programme includes specific training on face-to-face communication with customers.</P>
      <P>In addition, special training seminars have been held throughout the country for certain local office staff at which the implementation of the employment action plan was discussed.  These seminars were attended by deciding officers from each local office and focused on, <i>inter alia,</i> the legislative conditions of entitlement to unemployment benefit and assistance and on the need for proper and fair procedures to be followed in reviewing cases.</P>
      <P>Also there is a separate training course for deciding officers to help them underake their decision-making duties especially when assessing complex circumstances.  The course includes training on employment and educational supports and on the implementation of control procedures in the unemployment schemes area.</P>
      <P>Updated provisions on the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking employment for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit were set out in regulations made earlier this year.  Detailed guidelines to accompany the regulations and to assist deciding officers in their application of the &ldquo;availability&rdquo; and &ldquo;genuinely seeking work&rdquo; conditions were issued to all local offices.  In addition, each local office has a designated training officer who is responsible for addressing the training needs of all local office staff.  This involves assessing training needs and delivering training responses as necessary.  A significant part of the trainer's time is devoted to ensuring that local office staff are prepared to effectively deal with the implmentation of new initiatives.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continuing high incidence of child poverty; and the steps, if any, being taken by his Department to provide an appropriate quality of life for all children.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of income support in respect of children plays a crucial role in combating the incidence of child poverty. There is widespread agreement that child benefit is one of the more effective mechanisms for the provision of child income support.  It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is universal, not taxable and not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>Substantial increases to the monthly rates of payment in recent budgets established the growing importance of child benefit within the overall child income support system, with a particular focus on the needs of larger families.  The increases provided for in the 1998 budget were targeted especially at larger families, who are at greater risk of poverty.  With effect from September of this year, the rates of child benefit were increased by £1.50 per month for the first two children and by £3 per month for the third and subsequent children.  This brought the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  A family with four children, for example, will now receive monthly payments of £147 or almost £34 per week.  This year's budget also made provision for the introduction of a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins.</P>
      <P>In addition, family income supplement plays a significant role in assisting low income families through the payment of a regular weekly supplement to parents on low pay.  The scheme is now calculated on a net income basis which will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Research has shown repeatedly that unemployment is a key factor in producing poor households, and this is particulary true for households containing children.  For this reason, the continuing fall in the level of unemployment, allied with the significant rise in employment, will have a positive impact on the level of poverty among Irish children.</P>
      <P>The introduction, under the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, of a system, referred to as poverty proofing, of assessing the poverty implications of significant policy proposals will also ensure that the needs of poor children &mdash; and the groups experiencing or at risk of falling into poverty &mdash; are addressed at policy design stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above actions, a specific initiative of note was the recent launch of the <Col N="316" /> foundation for investing in communities which seeks to encourage the businness community to become more involved in promoting social inclusion by encouraging the volunteering of time and resources in support of voluntary and community activity.  As particular focus of the foundation will be to seek new ways of addressing the needs of disadvantaged children, including supporting research into the root causes of disadvantage among children.</P>

      <P>The establishement of an inclusive society, where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, is a fundamental objective of this Government.  In formulating proposals for inclusion in the 1999 budget, therefore, the Government will be endeavouring to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a wide range of commitments relating to the areas for which I have responsibility, including commitments to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period; to progressively relax the qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and to increase the value of the allowance in real terms; to implement the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, including an overhaul of the means by which the State supports the income of people with disabilities; to refocus the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unit; and to establish a national mediation service.</P>
      <P>In addition, Partnership 2000 provides, <i>inter alia,</i>for the implementation of the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare before the end of the partnership; family income supplement to be reformed so as to be calculated on net income basis; the alleviation of the poverty trap created by the £60 spousal income limit for the purposes of entitlement to the qualified adult allowance and child dependent allowance; and the strengthening and expansion of the community development programme operated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the improvements provided for in the 1998 budget, substantial progress has already been made in relation to many of the above commitments.  For instance, the special £5 per week increase for pensioners marks a significant first step in meeting the Government's commitment to increase the old age contributory pension <Col N="317" /> to £100 per week by the year 2002.  The general £3 per week increase for those aged under 66 years means that 93.5 per cent of social welfare recipients are about or above the minimum Commission on Social Welfare recommended rate.</P>
    <P>Other commitments which have been implemented or progressed include the calculation of the family income supplement on a net income basis, with effect from the beginning of October, and the allocation of significant additional funding for the family mediation and marriage and child counselling services and the community development programme.  My priorities for the 1999 budget will include making further progress towards implementing the various programme commitments outlined above, having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>National lottery funding is used in my Department to support the community development programme, islands development programme and a number of family resource centres under the family and community services resource centre programme.  The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  Details of the funding paid in 1997 under these programmes is set out in the following appendix.  The total allocation for my Department in 1997 was £5.6 million.</P>
      <P>Each of these programmes provides funding on a three year basis to projects participating in the programmes and payments are made on a quarterly basis and depend on the continued implementation of the agreed work plan and receipt of accounts and returns for payments previously issued.  The total allocation for 1998 is £7.759 million.  In line with previous years the final list of payments, once available, will be deposited in the Oireachtas Library early in the new year for the information of Members.</P>
      <P>I might mention that applications for funding under the CDP are assessed by an independent technical group.  The functions of the group also include assisting the Department in drawing up a list of 30 priority areas/communities of interest to be targeted for the development of new projects as provided for in Partnership 2000 agreement. This involves gathering statistical data and other relevant information on a regional basis to inform the recommendations to be made.  The information gathering exercise is also being used to identify priority area for the family and community resource centre programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The group's membership is drawn from local projects participating in the community development programme, as well as CDP support agencies, the Combat Poverty Agency, ADM and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  This gives people directly involved in community development work on the ground a role in advising me on decisions in relation to selection of new areas and groups for funding.</P>

      <P>The annual rate of loss of experienced information technology, IT, staff from my Department is currently running close to 20 per cent.  National and indeed global shortages of people with IT skills, coupled with the current buoyant state of the Irish economy, are contributing in no small way to these losses.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of a high rate of staff turnover, my Department embarked on the year 2000 project early to ensure that the change of date problems are addressed in good time.  More than 90 per cent of the work needed to make the computer software Year 2000 compliant is now complete.  All Year 2000 work, including testing of computer interfaces with external organisations and replacement of network components, is scheduled for completion in mid 1999.</P>
      <P>The erosion of IT skills is, however, a cause for concern for my Department and for other Departments which are heavily reliant on IT systems.  Possible measures to address this issue are being considered on a Civil Service wide basis at present.  While top priority continues to be given to the Year 2000 project, the capacity to undertake other critical projects is decreasing.</P>

      <Quest>his views on figures released recently by his Department which confirm that 57,000 adults are in receipt of incomes which are less than the target rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986; and the implications for this level of documented impoverishment in view of his and the Government's commitment to the implementation of a national anti-poverty strategy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government views the creation of an inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity and the incentive to participate, as a key objective.  In formulating proposals for the 1999 budget, the Government will be aiming to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all.</P>
      <P>With specific regard to bringing all social welfare payment rates to the minimum levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, current policy in this area is determined having regard to the commitments contained in Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, namely, that the recommended rates will be implemented by the end of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has already been made in this regard.  The 1998 budget provided for a general increase of £3 per week for some 560,000 social welfare recipients aged under 66 years, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 6,000 people on reduced rate contributory payments, together <Col N="322" /> with a 3 per cent increase, in general, in the rates from some 144,500 qualified adults.</P>
    <P>These increases mean that payments to over 797,900 recipients, representing 93.5 per cent of all recipients, are about or above the minimum recommended rates, while payments to a further 57,000 recipients of short-term social assistance, equating to 6.5 per cent of the total, are still about 3 per cent below the target rate.</P>
    <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments will be considered by the Government in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and the commitments made in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, Partnership 2000 and the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to achieving the targets set out in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy &mdash; including, as I have said, achieving the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Government's resolve to tackle the issue of social exclusion can be seen in the recent decision that all significant policy proposals should be examined to assess their impact on those in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty. This decision is reflected in the updated Government procedures booklet which was recently circulated to all Departments.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the value of a person's own home is excluded from the means assessment for the widow's-widower's non-contributory pension.  In addition, rental income is not counted for the means-test where the pensioner would otherwise live alone.</P>
      <P>The yearly value of any other property belonging to the person is calculated as follows: the first £2,000 of the capital value of the property is excluded, the yearly value of the next £20,000 of the capital value of the property is assessed at 7.5 per cent; the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds £22,000 is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>Any outstanding mortgage on property assessed under the above rule is deducted from the capital value and the remainder is assessed as above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in social welfare legislation, to allow deductions for mortgage payments in relation to the family home, for either <Col N="323" /> the widow's/widower's non-contributory pension. Any proposals in this regard would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

As there are over 472,000 people in receipt of social assistance payments it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments, as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated.  For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes.  However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to achieve greater equity in the system.  The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 provided the opportunity to commence this process.  Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>These revised capital assessment provisions were extended to the old age non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's non-contributory pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes from October 1997 and to the rent allowance scheme for former controlled tenancies from June, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised capital assessment provisions are of benefit to the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital.  For example, a single old age pensioner can now have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension &mdash; an increase of £3,173 on the previous arrangements.  A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension &mdash; an increase of £6,345.  A single pensioner can have up to £37,150 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have <Col N="324" /> up to £74,300 before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
    <P>In addition, the effective assessment rates of capital have been lowered for most recipients with capital.  For example, under the former arrangements the effective assessment rate for all levels of capital for old age non-contributory pension purposes was approximately 10 per cent in the case of single people and 5 per cent for a married couple.  Under the new procedures, capital of up to £20,000 is now assessed progressively up to a rate of 6.75 per cent in the case of a single pensioner and up to a rate of 3 per cent in the case of a married pensioner couple.  As only about 2 per cent of single old age pensioners and 4 per cent of married pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, the new arrangements have improved the income position of the vast majority of old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Any further improvement of the capital assessment procedures including their extension to schemes would have cost implications.  These schemes not yet covered, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance would have to be examined in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that widows and widowers are being treated in an equitable manner compared with other social welfare recipients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow's and widower's pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.  To qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension, a person may use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.  Also a widow or widower can qualify on his-her own or late spouse's record.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate for the widow's-widower's contributory pension at £74.10 if under 66 and £76.10 if over 66, is currently 103 per cent of the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended main rate.  The non-contributory rate at £70.90 if under 66 is 99.8 per cent of the commission's rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one-parent family payment is available to those widows or widowers, with children, who do not qualify for a contributory widow's-widower's pension.  This payment is available to men and women who are parenting alone and it is designed to, firstly, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents, and, secondly, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of <Col N="325" /> economic independence.  To this end, an earnings disregard of £6,000 per year is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those widows and widowers without children who do not qualify for the contributory pension.  This is payable subject to a means test.  I understand that the Deputy is particularly interested in access to the free schemes.  Free travel is available to all people in the State aged 66 years and over.  The other free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.  This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.  The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes will commence in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being acheived in the most efficient and effective manner.  If the Deputy has any particular areas in mind, I would be glad to consider them as part of this review process.</P>
    <P>The question of future improvements for widows and widowers &mdash; as for all social welfare clients &mdash; is a matter for consideration by the <Col N="326" /> Government in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.  I am satisfied widows and widowers are being treated in an equitable manner compared with other social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>Such visas are issued on the strict understanding that the person concerned is simply visiting this country and will return to their own country when their holiday in Ireland is finished.  Accordingly applications for work permits cannot be considered while they are here on holiday.</P>

      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  The Act applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as a person being an individual, a body <Col N="338" /> corporate or an unnamed corporate body or person engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
      <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, contains offences and penalties provisions for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act.  In addition, it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition.  A Director of Competition Enforcement has been appointed in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
      <P>There are two alternative ways of pursuing allegations of breaches of competition rules:</P>
      <P>(i) take civil action, in the courts, under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or,</P>
      <P>(ii) make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement under the 1996 Act requesting him to investigate the alleged breach(s).  If there are grounds for prosecution following investigation the matter is then prosecuted through the courts.  The Director of Competition Enforcement is in the Competition Authority, Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>Any allegations of anti-competitive behaviour therefore fall to be dealt with by the independant Competition Authority and/or the courts.</P>

      <P>The Trade Advisory Forum provides a structured basis for consultation and acts in an advisory capacity to me and my Government colleagues.  Since the forum first met in March of this year, it has developed an agreed prioritised agenda of issues which constitute its workplan. The work plan relates to key strategic issues relevant to exporter interests and to trade policy in general.  A copy of that work plan is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Issues considered recently have been the impact of European Monetary Union, the experiance and capabilities of the indigenous sector and the question of competitive infrastructure.  At its last meeting the forum invited Dr. Stefan Bungart, Director General of the National Institute for Transport and Logistics, to lead a presentation to the members on competitive infrastructure.</P>

The CAI subsequently provided information to my Department on a range of possible areas for a project.  My Department encouraged the association to explore the matter further and to revert to the Department with more details, including details of the costs involved.  My Department wrote to the CAI in September reminding it of the offer that had been made. However, as I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 109, the CAI did not take up the offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports that deforestation may have been a contributory cause of the <Col N="351" /> recent devastation in Central America.  Ireland, as a member of the European Union, is a signatory to all the recent major forestry agreements and protocols including Strasbourg, Rio, Helsinki, Lisbon and Kyoto and fully supports the principles of sustainable forest management. These principles specifically concern widespread deforestation and ensure that forests are managed in an environmentally sensitive fashion. Ireland through the forest service of my Department was very active during the Irish Presidency of the EU on the international panel of forests promoting the aims of sustainable forest management.</P>
      <P>Ireland is already involved at international level in relation to the position of tropical forests and on import substitution in the long-term.  I recognise that the destruction of tropical forests is one of today's major environmental issues.  Irish forest policy as set out in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector is committed to the implementation of a programme of sustainable forest management.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of certification I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 123, 124 and 125 of 4 November 1998.  The question of forest certification is market process between consumers and producers of forest products.  Any such procedure introduced here will have to conform with Irish forestry laws, policies, national sustainable plans and codes of practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that I have been for some time very conscious of the wide-ranging concerns that have been expressed by public representatives, several organisations and by members of the general public about the use of jet skis and fast power craft.  Vessels known as personal water craft, together with speed boats, are the most commonly cited craft which have given rise to public concern.  The concerns expressed suggest that there are instances where perhaps inexperienced operators of these craft have shown scant regard for safety.  Safety must be a primary and integral part of water sports activities, particularly where power craft are involved.</P>
      <P>While the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to prevent these craft operating in certain areas, the Deputy will be aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27 of 27 May 1998 of the difficulties concerning the implementation of these regulations.</P>
      <P>As I have stated before, my overriding concern as Minister with responsibility for the prevention of loss of life at sea and the promotion of sustainable development of marine tourism and leisure is to ensure that such craft are operated in a safe and responsible manner.</P>
      <P>I have identified the need for action on a number of fronts.  A marine safety working group (MSWG) operates under the chairmanship of the Director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of my Department, with the aim of creating and communicating marine safety information and messages, to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.  The safety working group meets regularly and has produced a number of &ldquo;Safety on the Water&rdquo; booklets, leaflets and posters for widespread dissemination.  A safety code for jet skis and fast power boats which is available in poster, flyer and sticker form has been drawn up and is in being widely distributed by the director of IMES.  The purpose of the code is to heighten awareness of the requirement to operate such craft in a safe manner with particular regard to the safety of other water users.</P>
      <P>I am taking steps to ensure that this safety code is communicated to purchasers and users of jet skis and fast power craft and that suppliers of such craft will assist in disseminating the code. Also, local authorities are being requested to post the code in areas where jet skis and fast power craft are used.  The National Safety Council will also be involved in promoting the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource is examining at my request and with the benefit of independent expertise the options for the management of the operation of fast power craft.  The examination <Col N="353" /> is, amongst other things, looking at appropriate statutory and non-statutory models for management and promotion of the safe use of such craft. The institute is liaising closely with my Department in the matter and will draw on management models at a number of locations in Ireland and abroad.  In addition, there will be full consultation with interested parties, including public authorities and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the control of recreational fast power craft must be addressed on a number of fronts.  My immediate concern is to ensure that progress is made as a matter of urgency in raising safety awareness among the users of such craft. The use of statutory mechanisms to regulate such craft is complex form both safety and legal perspectives but I am determined that if statutory measures are identified as being necessary the various public agencies will agree on a plan of action to implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent estimates provided by the Marine Institute suggest that the total value of the commercial salmon catch based on 1997 recorded catch of 175,000 fish is around £7.4 million.  The estimate is based on the informed assumption that 20 per cent are sold locally for home consumption, 20 per cent to restaurants and 60 per <Col N="354" /> cent to processors for smoking, etc.  The average value of each commercially caught salmon, including first sale and value added, is around £42 based on this estimate.</P>
    <P>The reported total national rod catch of salmon for 1997 was about 33,000 fish, most of which would have been retained for personal consumption.  It is estimated that tourism angling expenditure in its totality, (game and coarse anglers) contributes £57 million to GNP, while domestic anglers contribute some £22 million (1996 Bord Fáilte figures).  Figures are not available for salmon tourism angling separately, but it has been calculated by the Marine Institute extrapolating from data specific to the State owned Eriff Fishery, that the value of an individual rod caught salmon can range on average between £96 to £205. The value of each salmon is a function on whether the fish was caught by a local or tourist angler.  It does not follow, however, that the opportunity cost of the release of a marginal salmon from the commercial to the angling sector is equivalent to £96-£205 as a significant proportion of the salmon so released would remain uncaught.</P>

      <P>Mayo County Council has applied for a licence pursuant to the Foreshore Acts 1933 and 1992 in respect of the laying, use and maintenance of an outfall pipe on an area of foreshore at Old Head, Louisburgh, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>A notice of the application was published in <i>The Mayo News</i> on 25 May 1998.  Two objections were received within the specified period of 21 days.  These objections were referred to the county council for comment.  The objections together with the council's comments were then referred to the Department's specialist experts for examination.</P>
      <P>When the examination has been completed I will consider all aspects of the case before coming to a decision on the application.</P>

      <P>A full formal investigation into this tragic accident was carried out by a district justice with two nautical assessors under section 466 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1994.  The report of this formal investigation was published on 17 July 1991.  The report prepared by Captain Kirwan under section 728 of the Act was available to the formal investigation team.</P>
      <P>The High Court, in a judgment dated 25 January 1991, regarding an application by the widow of one of the deceased officers for among other issues the production of all reports, ruled that the plaintiff had not established that she has a right to the production of Captain Kirwan's report.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that the Kirwan report, along with numerous other reports, were prepared on the basis that they would not be published.  It would not in my view be appropriate to re-open such reports at this time.</P>
      <P>I should mention that I decided when Minister for the Marine in 1992 that all future reports on marine accident inquiries should be published and that is now established policy.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be presenting to the Government proposals to address the recommendations in the report of the policy review group on marine casualty investigation.  The key proposal is the establishment of a new statutory marine casualty investigation board with enhanced powers to investigate marine casualties and to publish expeditiously reports of the board's findings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me by Ballyshannon Harbour Commissioners and others in relation to the provision of channel marking at Ballyshannon Harbour.</P>
      <P>I am advised that marking of the channel as required for navigation purposes would cost in the region of £50,000.  There is not provision in my Department's Vote for such an expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can advise that a recently completed EU funded study of Irish commercial seaport capacity confirmed that there has been no sea-going commercial activity at Ballyshannon since the 1950s with only the occasional pleasure boat using the facility.  The study confirms that the navigation marks at the side of the channel have deteriorated <Col N="356" /> and need replacement and that prospects for development of yacht and pleasure boat facilities exist, if safe access is provided along the four mile navigable channel.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in touch with Donegal County Council who have agreed to the transfer of the harbour to local authority control, as provided for under the Harbours Act, 1996.  I also intend to raise the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, whose consent is required for the transfer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium identifies as a key priority &ldquo;transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities&rdquo; in the context of securing and enhancing the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future.  Partnership 2000 also commits to &ldquo;review the strategic options for the future development and management of declining commercial regional ports&rdquo;.  Furthermore, the strategy statement 1998 &ndash; 2000 of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commits as a key objective &ldquo;to facilitate the restructuring of the roles of sub-regional ports&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Within these contexts, I have initiated a review of all State regional ports and harbours which fall under the Harbours Act, 1946, including Ballyshannon.</P>
    <P>Consultants KPMG Ltd. have been appointed and have commenced their work.  All 16 regional harbours covered by the review will be consulted fully.</P>
    <P>For harbours such as Ballyshannon which have long since become defunct in terms of commercial traffic the review provides an ideal opportunity to decide the best future options for development.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to Ballyshannon will be the consultants' remit which includes assessment and recommendations on the preparation of a strategic framework for future development; best use of assets and future financing, and potential future uses including for marine leisure.</P>
    <P>The consultants will welcome submissions from interested persons or bodies and a public consultation process has been initiated through the national and local press.</P>
    <P>The consultants will report back to me within a tight timeframe (by February next) and I intend to publish the review findings including conclusions on future development and financing options for Ballyshannon Harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the House in response to a question by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald on 30 September that I am aware of problems facing the eastern rite Catholic Church in Romania also known as the Romanian Uniate Church.</P>
      <P>From our contacts with the Holy See, the Commission of the European Union, which has a Mission in Bucharest, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe there do not appear to be reports of systematic discrimination against members of the Romanian Uniate Church.  However, there are specific problems such as the issue of the restitution of church property and places of worship.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of properties whose restitution is sought by the Romanian Uniate Church are currently in the possession of the Orthodox Church.  This issue is one of several considered at the recent &ldquo;Reconciliation Dialogue&rdquo; between the two churches which was held in Bucharest on 28 October 1998.  They have agreed that in the first instance the issue should be addressed at diocesan and parochial levels and that the outcome should be discussed at the next meeting of the Dialogue Commission in 1999.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to keep all aspects of this issue under review both in our EU and multilateral contacts and directly with the Romanian authorities.  I would like to confirm that on my instructions the Deputy's concerns on these issues were brought to the direct attention of the Romanian authorities last week.</P>

      <P>APSO is a state-sponsored body established in <Col N="364" /> 1974 to promote and sponsor temporary personal service by skilled Irish people in developing countries.  The focus of its work is increasingly on local skills enhancement in support of self-reliance and sustainable development.  APSO is funded from an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The provision for 1998 is £10.7 million.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs appoints the board of the agency, which includes an official from the Department.  APSO is represented on the committees which examine funding applications under the various schemes operated by Irish aid, e.g. NGO co-financing, emergency and rehabilitation assistance, human rights and democratisation schemes.</P>
      <P>APSO's annual activities are approved by the board of the agency in line with its strategic plan. The Department and APSO co-operate closely in a number of areas.  For example, in the 1997-98 period, the Department and APSO, in conjunction with the OSCE and EU, have placed 234 Irish election monitors and supervisors in a number of countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Croatia, Lesotho, Liberia, Pakistan, Slovakia, Ukraine and Yemen.  Earlier this year, APSO, with the support of the Department, launched the rapid reponse register which was developed at the request of the Department in line with the commitment given in the Government's White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy (1996).  These costs are absorbed within APSO's grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>In response to the recent devastation caused by hurricane Mitch in Central America, the Department has allocated £80,000 in emergency assistance through APSO, which is active on the ground in the countries most affected.  This is separate from the agency's annual grant-in-aid and has been allocated on an exceptional basis in view of the extreme circumstances on the ground. APSO personnel based in Central America have been redeployed in the short-term to maintain some level of essential services to the people, who have seen many of the gains of development projects swept away in the floods.  Assistance provided through APSO has included food, medicines and clothes.  APSO has also despatched a small number of medical and logistics experts to the region to support the relief effort.</P>

Proposals are considered for events for, e.g. performances, exhibitions, lectures, the full costs of which are not available to those involved in their organisation or performance.  Decisions on the disbursement of funds are made by me based on the Cultural Relations Committee's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The question of assessing and meeting <Col N="371" /> public demands for transport services is a matter of Córas Iompair Éireann and its operating subsidiaries.  I have no function in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>There is no legislation dealing with the issue of overcrowding on trains.  However, I am aware of the discomfort that passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times. There has been continuing growth in Intercity passenger numbers and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on some routes including the Cork to Dublin line.  It is a matter for Iarnród Éireann's operational personnel to satisfy themselves that the number of passengers being carried in any particular type of carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.  I understand my Department's railway inspecting officer has recently been in contact wiht Iarnród Éireann regarding the carriage of standing passengers on trains.</P>
      <P>Ongoing investment in rolling stock will increase the capacity available to deal with peak periods.</P>

      <P>I have had overtures from Bord na Móna and from a third party about the possibility of providing a further new peat plant which would utilise the Bord na Móna fuel peat resources at Coolnagun and Ballivor.</P>
      <P>A new 120MW peat fired generating plant, which is to be constructed in the East Midlands, is due to come on stream by the middle of 2001.</P>
      <P>The electricity sector in Ireland is due to be liberalised from February 2000 under the terms of the EU Electricity Directive.  That Directive allows a member state to make provision for the use of indigenous resources to meet up to 15 per cent of its annual electricity requirements.</P>
      <P>I am in the process of defining detailed legislative provisions to implement the EU Electricity Directive in Ireland.  As part of this process, I will be introducing legislation in the House in the near future to provide for the setting up of a Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of further electricity generating plants will fall to be determined under the provisions of the forthcoming legislation.  One of the functions of the new commission will be to <Col N="373" /> issue authorisation for the construction of new generating plant.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the economics of any increase in the use of peat for electricity generation would have to be carefully considered in the context of the emerging liberalisation of the Irish electricty market.  Over and above this, the commitments Ireland is facing on CO 2 levels arising from Kyoto have implications for the building of further new peat plant.</P>

      <P>As part of the Defence Forces restructuring and reorganisation process, a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the First Line Reserve, the FCA and the Slua Muirí, is taking place.  In that regard there is a consultative process in train which is intended to elicit the views of serving members on the future development of the organisation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following bodies are examining various matters that fall within my Department's remit:-</P>
      <P>1.  The Interdepartmental Group on the Defence and Security Environment.</P>
      <P>Established as part of the preparation process for the White Paper on Defence, this group comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of Foreign Affairs; Finance; Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.  For security reasons the detailed work of the group will not be published.  However, the results of this study will form an input to the White Paper process.</P>
      <P>Other work on the White Paper will be supported by <i>ad hoc</i> groups of civil and military officers which will generate the inputs to the White Paper in line with the developing consultative and management process.  I propose to bring the White Paper to Government by summer 1999.</P>
      <P>2.  Following the recent Government decision on the reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a consultation group was established to provide a forum for the input of the key stake-holders in relation to the State air and sea services.  There are two broad dimensions to the required planning work.  The first relates to the strategic issues to be covered in the White Paper on Defence and the second to the effectiveness and efficiency measures recommended by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants.  The consultation group, which I am chairing, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>3.  The Steering Group for the Study of the Reserve.  This group was set up earlier this year to oversee and direct the work of a military board which was reviewing the Reserve Defence Forces. The group has an independent chairman and is made up of senior civil and military officials of my Department and a serving FCA officer.  It is due to report to me early next year.</P>
      <P>4.  The interdepartmental task force to report and make recommendations on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare.  The Government acting on my advice, approved the appointment of this group in July 1998.  In addition to both civil and military officials of my Department, the task force also has representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Food, the Environment and Local Government, Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Both Kildare County Council and the Midlands East Regional Tourism Authority are also represented.  The task force held its first meeting in August and has been requested to report to me before the end of March 1999.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of this case.  The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs in March 1997.  It did not however deal with their individual entitlements but referred the matter to the High Court for assessment of damages.  The claims made raise many complex issues still to be determined by the courts.  The legal teams on both sides are making every effort to get this action on for hearing.  Discovery sought by the plaintiffs' solicitors has been complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 133, 154, and 178 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the task force which were agreed by the group at its first meeting on 18 November are:</P>
      <P>to devise an action plan for the development of the beef industry covering the whole sector from primary production through to processing and marketing with a view to enabling the sector to overcome the obstacles impeding its development and to generate better returns from markets.</P>
      <P>The members of the beef task force are drawn from senior levels within the production and processing sectors of the beef industry as well as from the relevant organisations servicing the industry. The membership is as follows: John Malone (Chairman), Secretary General, Department of Agriculture and Food; Tom Moran, Assistant Secretary, Department of Agriculture and Food; Tom Parlon, President IFA; Michael Berkery, General Secretary IFA; Raymond O'Malley, Chairman IFA Beef Committee; Tom McAndrew, Chairman Irish Meat Association; John Smith, Chief Executive Irish Meat Association; Tom MacParland, Managing Director, Kildare Chilling; Dan Browne, Managing Director, Dawn Meats; Liam McGreal, Managing Director, Kepak; Frank Allen, President ICMSA; John Cunningham, ICOS &mdash; Dairygold; Michael Duffy, Chief Executive, An Bord Bia; Mike Feeney, Enterprise Ireland; John Kane, National Industrial Secretary, SIPTU; Donal Carey, Teagasc; Paddy Moore, Personal Adviser to Minister Walsh.</P>
      <P>Executive Co-ordination-Secretariat: Derek Breen, (Enterprise Ireland); Aidan Cotter (An Bord Bia); Richard Healy and Jarlath Coleman (Department of Agriculture and Food).</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 12, 27 and 39 on 12 November, the composition of the task force strikes the correct balance and will bring the necessary expertise to bear on the issues which need to be addressed if the beef industry is to achieve its full potential.</P>
      <P>As the group is already at what I would consider to be the outer limit in size for effectiveness, I am unable to make any further additions. However, I have made it clear that organisations or bodies which are not represented directly on the task force are invited to make written or oral submissions to the task force through the Secretariat, should they wish to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to consumer representation I am satisfied the make up of the task force, including Bord Bia, the statutory agency responsible for promotion on domestic and international markets, will take full account of consumer interests. I am also satisfied that the interests of beef producers are adequately repesented on the task force.</P>

The appeal was fully examined by the headage and premia appeals unit and the herdowner was notified on 17 July 1998 that his appeal had been unsuccessful.  The herdowner was not satisfied that all the points raised in his appeal had been addressed regarding an inspection which was carried out and a further letter issued to him on 1 August 1998 from the district inspector.  The herd-owner, in his letter of 30 October 1998 has not presented any new evidence and I regret, therefore, that his appeal cannot be re-examined.</P>

On processing the resubmitted application a further problem arose and the applicant has again been contacted by my Department in this regard.  As soon as he replies to this query with the relevant information, the processing of his application can be completed.</P>

    <P>To date the area aid unit has processed for payment over 90 per cent of all applications, representing 90 per cent of forage applications and 95 per cent of arable applications.

      <P>The common organisation of the EU sheep market provides for free trade in both live animals and meat.  All sheep presented for slaughter at EU approved plants supervised by my Department are subject to veterinary examination and are accepted for slaughter on the basis of freedom from clinical signs of disease.</P>
      <P>As regards imports, the position is that sheep for slaughter coming from Britain, either directly or through Northern Ireland, must be accompanied by an animal health certificate signed by an official veterinary inspector and be assigned to a particular slaughterhouse.  Under EU regulations, all sheep for export must undergo a health inspection within 48 hours prior to loading and must not show any clinical signs of disease before being certified.</P>
      <P>Details of each consignment of animals for export are required to be sent in advance by the relevant authority to the district veterinary office, DVO, in the county of destination, through the EU animal notification system, ANIMO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since November 1992, a bilateral arrangement has existed between my Department and the <Col N="398" /> Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, DANI, in respect of sheep going to an from Northern Ireland.  Under the arrangement, sheep of Northern Ireland origin may move freely here and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There is no EU or national legislation in relation to the branding of lamb.  The food labelling requirements provide that food sold in prepackaged form must carry the name of the country of origin only when the absence of this information would mislead.  The application of this legislation is monitored by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The bulk of sheep slaughtered at EU approved plants are sent out of the country with commercial documentation or veterinary health certification which only requires that the plant of slaughter be identified.</P>

      <P>As there are around 8,000 commonages in the country it will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages. In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  This means that the farmers concerned who are already in REPS or who join the scheme on the basis of the national framework plan, can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the application of pensions increases to former head postmasters is a matter, in the first instance, for An Post and the Department of Public Enterprise.  I can, however, say that this matter has been the subject of a formal appeal to me under paragraph 20 of An Post Main Superannuation Scheme, 1990, which provides that a member or former member of the scheme who considers that the company has failed to or refused to make an award under this scheme may appeal to the Minister for Finance whose decision shall be final.</P>
      <P>I considered the appeal and I decided to reject it.  The payments in question were not a permanent part of the pay scales of the postmaster grades during the period 1 June 1988 to 31 December 1991.  They were part of a productivity deal paid to serving staff, on an unconsolidated basis, during that period pending the achievement of agreed specified savings.  A core policy of pensions parity is that only permanent changes or additions to pay scales are passed on to pensioners; accordingly, the payments were not passed on to these pensioners during this period. I would point out that the productivity payments were consolidated into the pay scales with effect from 1 January 1992 and the benefit was passed on to pensioners from that date.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, puts a 4 per cent limit on the growth of net current expenditure.</P>
      <P>Net current expenditure comprises net current Supply Services and Central Fund Services.</P>
      <P>Gross current supply services shows the overall level of current expenditure by Departments.  Net current supply services shows the level of current expenditure voted by the Oireachtas.  These are arrived at by deducting from gross current supply services the receipts which are taken into Department Votes through Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Central Fund Services are paid for directly from the Central Fund on statutory authority without being voted annually.  Central Fund Services mainly cover payments for the redemption of debt and other items such as Ireland's contribution to the EU budget and judicial salaries and pensions.</P>
      <P>This definition of current spending is well established.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme made quite clear the way in which current spending was to be defined.

However, the Deputy may recall that, during the debate on the Central Bank Act, 1998, I outlined the position in relation to an examination undertaken by officials in my Department into the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions. That investigation identified potential legal and constitutional issues, particularly in relation to property rights, which have to be taken into account in the development of policy in relation to such accounts.  I pointed out that this is a very complex issue and one which requires very careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of audit and investigative staff involved in tax audit districts as at 30 September 1998 was 701.</P>
      <P>Audits are carried out under different programmes: comprehensive audits &mdash; covering all taxheads; VAT audits; PAYE/PRSI audits; relevant contract tax audits &mdash; mainly affecting the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Audits on both companies and individuals are carried out in 30 tax districts (including the specialist Dublin audit districts).  Staff in 27 of these districts are deployed on audits of both individuals and companies, both large and small. In addition three districts specialise exclusively on company audits, by reference to industry sectors, viz.  property development; multi-national companies and PLCs and the financial sector. Statistics are not readily available as to the number of audits carried out on particular sizes of companies.  However, I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that in screening cases for audit selection under the system of self-assessment, the largest cases are reviewed regularly <Col N="412" /> and, in addition, cases where there is substantial tax at risk are subject to more frequent review than for smaller companies.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 the numbers employed in all Government departments and offices have been regulated by guidelines approved by successive Governments which set ceilings on the numbers employed in the Civil Service as a whole and in individual departments and offices.  The current agreed staffing target for the Revenue Commissioners is 6,044.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in common with the management of each Government department or office to deploy staff within these guidelines in accordance with their own priorities.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the level of resources devoted to audit is kept under regular review.</P>

      <P>The reliefs known as section 23 reliefs are available in respect of rental income arising from property made available for renting where expenditure has been incurred in the construction, conversion or refurbishment of such property.  Among the conditions for the reliefs are that the rental property must be let for a minimum of ten years; and if the property is withdrawn from renting within the ten year period, the full amount of the relief previously granted is clawed back; and if the property is sold within the ten year period to another owner, the full amount of the relief is clawed back <Col N="413" /> from the original owner, but if the new owner continues to let the property the relief will pass on to the new owner.</P>
      <P>Owner occupiers of residential property also benefit from tax exemptions in certain designated areas.  A qualifying premises for the purposes of the relief is one which is first used after the qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the individual as his or her only or main residence.  Under this owner occupier relief, 5 per cent per annum of the construction cost or 10 per cent per annum of the refurbishment cost is offsettable against all the income of the owner occupier for ten years. Owner occupiers who sell their property within the ten year period are not subject to a claw back of relief but the remainder of the relief is not passed on to the new owner.  The introduction of a claw back on the owner occupier allowance would involve complex legislative provisions regarding balancing charges which could discourage potential owner occupiers purchasing homes in designated areas.  The two types of relief i.e. the section 23 relief and the owner occupier relief are distinct and separate reliefs and are not interchangeable. The purpose of the incentives is to encourage the construction or refurbishment of new residential accommodation.  It is not considered anomalous in the circumstances that no relief is given to an owner occupier purchasing a second hand building.</P>

However, the allocation by county of the incomes of PAYE employees, which represent the bulk of the tax receipts, would be misleading because each employee is associated in Revenue's computer system with the county in which his or her employer is registered for PAYE purposes, regardless of the address of the actual workplace or of the individual's home address.</P>

      <P>This question essentially refers to the position of cohabiting couples with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis of the treatment <Col N="415" /> of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than they would if they were two single people living together.  The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment.  Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax-free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns of cohabiting couples.  An inter-departmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  Consideration of tax measures in this area will await the group's report which is expected to be completed early next year.</P>

    <P>It is assumed that the increases in the single person's allowance, exemption limits, and standard rate band must be combined with double those increases for married persons assessed to tax on the aggregate basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> The figures for the single personal allowance include the cost of the normal consequential increases in the widowed person's allowance, the widowed parent allowance and the single parent allowance.</P>
    <P>These figures are provisional and are likely to be revised.  They show the cost of making changes as if each were made separately and without reference to other changes in the tax code.</P>

      <P>Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) is deducted from deposit interest at the standard rate of income tax, 24 per cent.  A reduced DIRT rate of 20 per cent applies to interest on special savings accounts which can only be held by individuals. Those aged 65 years or over and those who are permanently incapacitated, whose total income falls below their relevant allowances/exemption limit are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid.</P>
      <P>Dividends on credit union shares and interest on credit union deposits are not subject to DIRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> However, individuals are obliged to report dividends or interest received in their annual tax return and are liable to income tax at their marginal rate on this income.</P>
    <P>Special investment accounts (SIAs) are investment products offered by life assurance companies, unit trusts and stockbrokers and are not liable to DIRT, as such.  However, the return on SIAs <Col N="418" /> (whether by way of income or capital gain, both realised and unrealised) is taxable on an annual basis at 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>A summary table of conditions attaching to special savings accounts and special investment accounts follows.  This sets out the relevant conditions and the maximum individual limits for investments in these products.</P>

      <P>Under section 59(3) of the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.  The illnesses covered by this scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for persons under 16 years only <Col N="426" />&mdash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in Dublin 9 is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that in August and September of this year the dental team which operates in Larkhill dental clinic was part of a review of the school dental services in the Dublin North-West area.  As a result of this review it was decided to increase the number of sessions worked by Larkhill clinic and as such a second dental surgery is currently being planned by the board.  This second dental unit is likely to be operational within the next six months.  A consequence of this review is that the dental treatment to those school children who live in the Larkhill area will be increased and extended.</P>
      <P>I understand that confusion arose between the principal of the school and the clinic with respect to the continuity of the delivery of the service.  I have been advised that this uncertainty has since been rectified and the school is very pleased with the ongoing expansion and development which is occurring in the dental service.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries about this case from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of services to drug misusers in the Dublin area.  The individual in question has been seen by the health board and was placed on a waiting list for non-residential treatment on 22 October.  Appropriate treatment will be provided as soon as possible and the health board will be in contact directly with the individual in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the difficulties being experienced by the Eastern Health Board in establishing a treatment centre in the Dublin 12 area.  The provision of such a facility in this area in addition to those proposed for other areas of the city would go a long way towards reducing the waiting lists for treatment.  I would appeal, therefore, to local communities as well as to the public representatives to co-operate with the board in its efforts to provide treatment for people in their own locality.</P>

      <P>The services available for those suffering from dementia which includes those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, include a range of community services such as general practitioner services, public health nurses, access to community ward teams, care attendants available for long-term domiciliary support, home helps, and meals on wheels.</P>
      <P>People with dementia have access to acute medical and psychiatric assessment services when the need arises as the treatment of medical and psychiatric problems improves the quality of life for both sufferers and carers.</P>
      <P>Specialist medical services for older people &mdash; geriatric medicine services &mdash; include services for those with dementia who predominantly suffer from medical problems.  These services provide essential medical assessment in a day hospital linked to a department of medicine for older people in an acute general hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the dedicated services for dementia/Alzheimer's disease, it should be noted that people with these conditions who do not exhibit aggressive and/or disruptive behaviours are and will continue to be cared for in health board extended care hospitals and homes including day care units.  Private nursing homes also provide a substantial bed resource for Alzheimer's patients who receive assistance towards the <Col N="429" /> cost of their care via the subvention scheme operated under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland was formed by dedicated relatives and friends of persons with Alzheimer's disease to create maximum awareness of the illness and to supply information and help including day care to affected families.  In 1998, my Department allocated £180,000 funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The need to develop specialist psychiatry of old age services, including services for people with Alzheimer's disease who require psychiatric treatment, has been identified as a priority.  I am aware that services in this area will need to grow significantly over the next few years given the increasingly older population and the increased incidence of dementia among those in later old age.  An additional £1 million has been allocated to health boards in 1998 to develop such a service and I intend to continue this programme of development next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current position under the dental treatment services scheme, which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994, is that dental treatment services will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme which commenced on 1 November 1994 emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults with medical card eligibility.  Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons aged 65 years and over.</P>
      <P>Under the second phase of the scheme which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16 to 34 age group and the provision of full dentures to all medical card holders without any natural teeth.</P>
      <P>Routine treatment will be extended to the remaining age groups, namely 35 to 64 year olds, at a later stage in accordance with the level of funding available for the further development of adult dental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for medically compromised persons who are given priority irrespective of age on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.  Health boards also provide dental services to non-medical card holders in special needs groups.  Under the dental health action <Col N="430" /> plan dental services for special needs groups are identified as a high priority for the health board services.  Special needs groups include persons with a mental handicap, the medically compromised, persons in long stay institutions, the travelling community, designated refugee groups, rehabilitating drug users and any other specific target group in the community who may be recognised by the health board as having special difficulty gaining access to oral health care.</P>
    <P>Other persons without medical cards are likely to be eligible for treatment under the dental treatment benefit scheme which is operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for persons with PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Dental treatment services for children are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children after they leave national school up to 16 years of age on a phased basis.  Eligibility for dental services has already been extended to children up to their fourteenth birthday.</P>
    <P>Emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is currently available through the health boards for children in the 14 to 16 year old age group who have medical card entitlements.  I will further extend the children's dental services up to age 16 years, as provided under the dental health action plan, according as additional resources are available to me.</P>

      <P>Respite care is a vital part of the support services required by people who care for a family member who has a mental handicap and is provided in a number of ways.  In some cases it is provided in a residential setting using dedicated respite beds or residential places vacated by residents returning to their families at weekends.  Respite care is also provided by host families through the various &ldquo;Share a Break&rdquo; schemes and other similar schemes where individuals are placed with families who offer to assist in caring for persons with a mental handicap.  These breaks are generally for weekends or one or two week holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial additional funding was provided in recent years for the development of new services to persons with a mental handicap and includes investment in respite care services.  In the past 12 months or so, I have allocated £25 million capital and revenue funding towards the development and enhancement of the mental handicap services. These services will continue to be expanded <Col N="431" /> in line with the needs identified in Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; 1997-2001.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Eastern Health Board, I understand from the board that over 770 persons with a mental handicap availed of respite care in 1997.</P>
    <P>I am not yet in a position to comment on the overall level of funding which may be available for any particular service in 1999.</P>

      <P>In my replies to parliamentary questions recently raised by Deputies Ring, Seán Ryan and O'Sullivan, I stated that the records available to my Department at that time indicated four cases of E.coli 0157 during 1997, and three cases during 1998.  While these were the figures available to me at that time, there was some concern that they might not be an accurate reflection of the incidences of E.coli 0157 during the period in question.  Accordingly, my Department conducted a comprehensive review of this matter with the individual health board.</P>
      <P>This review shows that during 1996 eight cases of E.coli 0157 were recorded, 51 cases were recorded during 1997 and 59 cases have been recorded during 1998 to date.  A breakdown of these figures by health board region is as follows:</P>

    <P>Total number of cases for the period 1996 to 1998 (to date) &mdash; 118.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the Deputies concerned and I regret that my replies understated the real level of E.coli 0157.  It is a matter of concern to me that accurate data on this very important matter was not immediately to hand and I have taken steps to ensure that health boards will provide a more comprehensive and regular report on the incidences of E.coli 0157 to my Department.</P>
    <P>While all cases of E.coli 0157 infection in Ireland have been sporadic and there have not been epidemics of the infection here, nevertheless, it is imperative that the medical profession, the public and all persons engaged in food preparation are aware of E.coli 0157 and of the simple measures by which infection can be prevented.</P>
    <P>My Department has for several years now recognised the potentially serious implications of this infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations. A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder was issued in December 1996 to all the directors of public health in the health boards, who were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning with a view to identifying any possible case of the E.coli infection.</P>
    <P>More recently, following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the health promotion unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the public on this matter.  The leaflet advises, in particular, on the importance of properly cooking meat products, on the need to properly wash raw fruit and vegetables before eating and on the importance of observing good food hygiene and personal hygiene practices in order to prevent and control outbreaks of E.coli 0157 infection.</P>
    <P>While there is a legal requirement under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981-96, to notify cases of food poisoning generally, E.coli 0157 is not specifically notifiable.  The recently established National Communicable Disease Surveillance Unit, which will provide a comprehensive <Col N="435" /> broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne disease, is currently reviewing the whole area of disease notification and E.coli 0157 is being included in this review.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established an E.coli 0157 task force to examine the issue and to advise on the appropriate response in terms of regulation, standards and education for consumers and producers.  I understand that this task force will report within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the housing aid scheme for the elderly is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that, in the Dublin area, the works are undertaken by FÁS trainees with small, local contractors used where necessary.  In Wicklow and Kildare, projects are normally undertaken by small contractors.  The board advise that it has run into difficulties both in recruiting trainees and interesting small contractors in tendering for the small projects on offer under this scheme. However, the board reports that it is currently carrying out an overall review of the operation of this scheme with a view to achieving a greater throughput of projects and reducing waiting lists.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government, which is responsible for the funding of this scheme, recently increased the Eastern Health Board's allocation by £300,000.  I understand the board hopes that following the review of the scheme and with the additional allocation, the number of projects undertaken can be increased.</P>

      <P>The provision of sight testing in the Sligo and Leitrim area is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board.  The board has informed me that there are at present 1,274 patients awaiting ophthalmic services in its area, 959 of whom are children and 315 are adults.  Of the children, a total of 559 have been on a waiting list for between six and 24 months and of the adults only 22 have been on waiting lists for more than 12 months.  Of that 22, some have been offered appointments but could not avail of them at the time.  They will be scheduled for appointments between now and the end of the year. Despite the foregoing, measures are in place to ensure that urgent cases are dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I allocated the sum of £1 million between the eight health boards to address the issue of waiting lists for adult community ophthalmic services.  This initiative has seen a reduction of over 72 per cent in the numbers on waiting lists and a reduction in mean waiting time over the course of the year.  The North-Western Health Board waiting list for adult community ophthalmic services at 1 November 1997, has been reduced by over 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Sligo/Leitrim area, demand for community ophthalmic services continues to increase with 1,789 new referrals in the period 1 January to 20 November this year.  A total of 2,365 new patients were seen in this period, which has resulted in a reduction in the waiting list from 1,850 at the start of the year to 1,274 at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early 1998, a working group of representatives of the health boards and the Association of Optometrists Ireland was established to discuss the provision of an adult sight testing scheme to replace the existing <i>ad hoc</i> schemes and which would be similar in its application in each health board.  I am informed that these discussions are now close to conclusion and the financial implications <Col N="439" /> will be considered in the context of the 1999 allocations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced an increase of 9 per cent in charges in respect of private and semi-private rooms in public hospitals.  This increase will come into effect from 1 January 1999.  The increase was decided upon in the context of the Estimates.  The new levels for 1999 are set out in the following table. I do not propose at present to increase the statutory charge in respect of in-patient public hospital services which is currently set at £25 per day and subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period or the £20 charge for attendance at an accident and emergency department.</P>

      <P>Physiotherapy is one of the services needing development identified in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.  This year a total of £3 million was allocated to the health boards for development of these services, of which the North-Eastern Health Board was allocated £261,000.  Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by each health board following consultation with the local coordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services.  Priorities identified by the</P>
      <P>North-Eastern Health Board for the 1998 development funding were residential and respite care and home supports.</P>
      <P>The provision of physiotherapy services in individual cases is a matter for the relevant health board.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed information requested is set out in the following table.  Waiting times are counted as the longest waiting time for any applicant at a particular centre.  Applicants requiring an early test for urgent reasons are, however, given tests within considerably shorter periods. At present some 40 per cent of test applicants are tested within ten weeks and some 50 per cent within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>My Department is responding to this unsatisfactory situation by increasing the numbers and productivity of its driver testers.  Saturday testing has already been introduced.  A further package of productivity measures has recently been concluded and is being implemented.  This will provide for an additional 9,000 tests per year from the existing driver testing service.  This service is now moreover being augmented by the appointment of new driver testers both on a permanent and contract basis.</P>

      <P>Under the regulations governing the disabled persons grant scheme, my Department recoups to housing authorities 50 per cent of the cost of each disabled persons grant paid by them, subject to a maximum which was last increased to £4,000 in respect of works commenced on or after 1 March 1993.  There is no maximum grant set out in the regulations.  However, as housing authorities generally limit the grant they pay to twice the maximum recoupment available from my Department, the effective ceiling generally for the disabled persons grant is £8,000.</P>
      <P>Improvements to the terms of the disabled persons grant scheme are under examination in the context of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I hope to be in a position to announce decisions arising from this examination in the near future.</P>

I have approved the contract documents, with those variations, including the provision of ultraviolet disinfection facilities, which were considered necessary to the effective operation of the scheme.  A number of sewer lengths to serve undeveloped areas in Knockgriffin and Broomfield were not approved as they were not considered essential to the effective operation of the scheme and were not included in the preliminary report.  Furthermore they would not, in accordance with long-standing policy, qualify for 100 per cent grant recoupment.

      <P>Dublin Corporation submitted an environmental impact statement for the proposed Dublin port tunnel motorway to me on 15 July 1998 and submitted the motorway scheme on 17 July 1998.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions was 15 October 1998 and 172 submissions were received in my Department.  The National Roads Authority, NRA, submitted a toll scheme for the proposed port tunnel to me on 2 October 1998.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions was 13 November 1998 and ten submissions were received in my Department.  I am having arrangements made for the holding of a public inquiry into the motorway and toll schemes and I anticipate that this will be held early in the new year. When the public inquiry is completed the person who held the inquiry will submit a report to me, which I must consider, with the environmental impact statement, toll scheme and the submissions made, before making my decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I may approve <Col N="459" /> the motorway scheme, with or without modifications, or I may refuse to approve it.  Also, I may approve the proposed development on environmental grounds, with or without modifications, or I may refuse to approve it.  I may approve the toll scheme, with or without modifications, or I may refuse to approve it.  On receipt of the inspector's report and other relevant documentation there will be no undue delay on my part in coming to a decision in the matter.</P>
    <P>If I decide to approve the motorway scheme, with or without modifications, its construction and funding will then be a matter for the NRA and Dublin Corporation.  I understand it is estimated that the project as submitted to me would be completed within 43 months of the date of commencement of construction.  The NRA would also be responsible for determining the commencement date of the toll scheme if it is approved by me, with or without modifications.</P>

      <P>My Department recoups 90 per cent of the cost to local authorities of payments made in relation to the provision of emergency, usually bed and breakfast, accommodation, for homeless people, including asylum seekers.  The amount recouped by my Department for the years 1990 to 1997 and in 1998 to date is as follows: 1990, £115,000; 1991, £377,000; 1992, £676,000; 1993, £902,000; 1994, £1,359,000; 1995, £2,214,000; 1996, £3,090,000; 1997, £6,000,000; 1998 (to date), £18,432,700.</P>
      <P>The extent to which payments are attributable to emergency accommodation for asylum seekers is not readily available.

      <P>Revised proposals for a branch library and technical processing unit to be sited at Navan Road were received by my Department in April 1997.  Approval to proceed to tender issued to Dublin Corporation in relation to these proposals on 16 July 1998.  The estimated cost of the proposals, including book stock, at that time was £3,401,798.  A revised estimate of costs amounting to £3,871,330, including book stock costs of £700,000, was received from the corporation in late October.</P>
      <P>A sum of £287,000 received by Dubln Corporation from the disposal of the former mobile library facility in Essex Street and from the proceeds of an insurance claim relating to the same site, will form part of the local authority's contribution to the project.  Book stock for new library projects is normally 50 per cent funded by my Department.  As the tendering process has not yet been completed, the amount of grant aid to be paid towards the project has not yet been determined. Grant aid for library projects is provided by my Department from the proceeds of the national lottery surplus.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I visited County Cavan on 5 September 1997 and during my meeting with members and officials of the county council a number of issues were discussed in detail, including the investment needs of the county's road network. In the meantime during other visits to the county I had the opportunity to discuss with the Deputy and councillors the need to improve the road network, particularly non-national roads.  I am glad that the record grant allocations which I approved to Cavan County Council for 1998 have enabled a very substantial road works programme to be undertaken. As I outlined to the Deputy in correspondence dated 16 August 1998 I have said many times that the Government is committed to providing the necessary level of funding over the remaining years of the roads restoration programme to restore all regional and local roads throughout the county to a satisfactory condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 283 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputies relates to those former community employment workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a community employment scheme, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit rather than long-term unemployment assistance.  As a consequence, they do not have entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This issue arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  The purpose of that measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the person is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or job start etc.  It is important to note also that as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment would continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained repeatedly to the House, I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for community employment workers who requalify for unemployment <Col N="471" /> benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  The introduction of class A PRSI for community employment workers had the effect of placing them in the same position as other insured workers, in terms both of insurance benefits and of liabilities.  It will be appreciated that any concessions in this area could not, in equity, be confined to former community employment workers.  By way of illustrating the costs involved, it would cost some £5.4 million to extend entitlement to the Christmas bonus to all unemployment benefit and disability benefit claimants.  Any concessions, therefore, would carry a high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.</P>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to persons who are living in the State, aged 66 or over, and in receipt of a social welfare type payment.  It is also available to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the free telephone rental allowance, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted persons who satisfy this condition. This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged 75 years or over who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older and disabled persons who are either living alone or with persons who would be unable to summon help in an emergency.  The allowance, which is only for landlines, covers the rental charges and a small number of calls.  The cost of the installation of a second telephone socket is also covered by the allowance, but not the cost of an additional telephone.  The question of the extension of the scheme to include mobile phones raises a number of issues, including costs that would have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  However, over the years, additional categories of persons have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the issues raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is currently in receipt of deserted wife's benefit, applied for disability allowance on 9 January 1998.  She was examined by a medical assessor of the Department who was of the view that she did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance.  She appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and was examined by a different medical assessor who was also of the opinion that she did not satisfy the criteria for receipt of disability allowance.  An oral hearing of her appeal took place on 8 October 1998.  Having considered all of the evidence in the case, including the submissions of the person concerned at the oral hearing, the appeals officer determined that the statutory condition for entitlement to disability allowance that a person be substantially handicapped from undertaking suitable employment was not satisfied in her case.  The appeal was, accordingly, disallowed and the person concerned has been advised of the decision.</P>
      <P>The appeal officer has re-examined the case but does not consider that there are any new facts or evidence relating to the statutory medical qualifying test which would warrant a review of his decision.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied.  The various types of recognised diets are grouped into two categories.  The amount of supplement payable varies depending on which category of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependents.</P>
      <P>Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs. Increases in income, other than those arising from budgetary increases in basic weekly rates of payment, will result in a decrease in the rate of diet supplement payable.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, the amount of diet supplement paid to the person concerned will fall by £2.93 per week in January 1999 when his weekly invalidity pension payment increases by £10.80 per week on reaching the age of 65.  As a result, the person concerned will still be better off by £7.87 per week after both changes take effect.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to make any changes in the method for calculating entitlements to diet supplements for individual categories of persons such as the elderly.  It would be inequitable to provide special payments to one group of recipients and not to other groups.  Any such changes would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account.</P>

This year's pre-budget forum, which was held on Tuesday, 22 September 1998, was the eleventh, and the biggest, such event, with 27 organisations participating.

      <P>The forum gives voluntary organisations the opportunity to have a meaningful input into the budgetary process by ensuring that both I and my officials are fully appraised of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to social welfare improvements.</P>
      <P>There was a strong consensus among the various organisations attending the forum that the measures in this year's budget should share the benefits of economic growth with the poor and those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>I have brought the concerns highlighted by the representative organisations to the attention of the relevant members of Government.  Copies of their submissions have also been forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs.</P>

    <P>I have also had separate meetings with a number of other representative organisations, including <Col N="475" /> the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and the Carers' Association. In addition, submissions have been received from a wide range of voluntary organisations and interest groups representing trade unions, employers and business groups and others, including the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>The various proposals received have been examined by my Department, in so far as they relate to social welfare matters.  While it would not be possible to meet all of these demands, the most major of which would cost over £1.5 billion, in this year's budget, I will nevertheless be endeavouring to respond to the various concerns which have been raised in formulating my Department's budget package, having regard to the available resources and to the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footware allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.  The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health <Col N="476" /> board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  Certain persons on low income who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.  Under the scheme an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme has nearly doubled in the last seven years from £5.6 million in 1990 to over £11 million in 1998.  The income limits for the allowance are based on social welfare payments and are automatically raised each year in line with the budgetary increases in those payments.  Applications for assistance from those who do not qualify for payment under the scheme may be considered in special circumstances, under section 181 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 (Exceptional Needs Payments).</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to change the income limits other than the normal budgetary increases. Any additional increase in the income limits would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last five years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £45 million in 1997.  This year a sum of £45.2 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the fuel and light component of the consumer price index measures the changes in fuel costs.  These data show that fuel prices have fallen slightly in the last two years.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance was last increased in October 1985.  Increasing the rate of fuel allowance, or making it payable in summer as well as winter, could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account increases in primary weekly payment rates.  In that regard, the Deputy will recall that substantial increases of either £3 or £5 per week were paid from June 1998 in all the social welfare primary payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established by my Department in 1996 to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community.  Under the scheme, grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, which has undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the scheme's services.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems.  Funding is not available for conventional burglar alarms under this scheme.  Older people, aged 65 or over, who live alone or in households made up exclusively of older and/or other dependent vulnerable people and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves, can benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of this scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people by the provision of funding specifically for the once-off costs of installing security equipment and in this regard funding towards the annual charges, as mentioned by Deputy Howlin, is not available under the scheme.  A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates. A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow the Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications. They expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up <Col N="478" /> to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July last year this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, the Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objective and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  As the final report from the consultants is not yet available it would not be appropriate to consider making changes to the scheme at this point.</P>

      <P>The back-to-education allowance, BTEA, is an educational opportunities programme, mainly for unemployed persons, to enable them to participate in an approved educational course of study with a view to their return to the workforce.  The scheme also applies to lone parents and was extended this year to certain people with disabilities.  Unemployed persons must have been in receipt of an unemployment payment continuously for six months in order to qualify for the allowance.  The scheme when originally introduced applied to people unemployed for 15 months or more and was extended over a number of years to persons unemployed for six months or more.  This is a minimal requirement and there are no plans to change this.</P>

      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 301 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department.  Payment may continue as long as the asylum seeker is resident in the State.</P>
      <P>SWA payments are being made to approximately 3,700 households in respect of some 4,600 adults and about 1,500 children who are seeking asylum.  Over 70 per cent or asylum seekers are residing in private rented accommodation and in receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The balance are accommodated in bed and breakfast and hostel type accommodation which is funded by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance payments for asylum seekers to date in 1998 is estimated at about £18 million.  The total cost of payments to asylum seekers for 1998 is expected to be between £21 million and £25 million. The total expenditure for 1997 was approximately £12 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in relation to earlier years.  Prior to 1997, asylum seekers were not identified separately <Col N="480" /> from other SWA applicants but as there were fewer asylum seekers at that time, expenditure would have been lower.</P>

      <P>It is one of the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking suitable work.  The questionnaire referred to, which is in use in one area, forms part of an assessment of a customers efforts in seeking work and determining what supports might be provided to him or her in this regard.  It is designed to give the deciding officer the information he or she needs in determining a customer's entitlement.  It may also lead to the customer being further interviewed before a decision is made.  Every effort is made to ensure that the customer is informed of the various schemes and services available to support them in returning to work or education.</P>
      <P>The completion of the questionnaire in appropriate cases is one of a range of methods to assist in ensuring that customers are aware of the conditions of entitlement to unemployment payments and to assist them in accessing employment and other opportunities which may be available. The Department is glad to have any comments on questionnaires of this kind and I understand that the form in question is being revised in the light of some comments which were received.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met. <Col N="481" /> The closing date for applications under the 1998 scheme was 22 May and applications received before that date are currently being considered in the regional offices of my Department, which processes applications under the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, my Department is unable to trace an application for the group mentioned in the Deputy's question.  If the Deputy lets me have further information, I will be happy to have the matter investigated further.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the lines requested by the Deputy are not compiled by my Department.  The provision of employment and training supports for people with disabilities is a matter for which the Minister for Health and Children has primary responsibility.  However, following the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board in the new year, as recommended by the establishment group for a national disability authority, the main employment and training supports for people with disabilities will become the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>While the main employment supports for people with disabilities do not fall within my Department's remit, I am nevertheless conscious of the important role social welfare income support plays and, in particular, the consequences that taking up employment and other opportunities can have on entitlements.  In this regard, significant progress has been made by my Department in recent years in relation to the employment and educational supports being provided for people with disabilities.  For example, the back-to-work allowance scheme, under which unemployed persons can take up employment and continue to retain a portion of their social welfare payment and the related secondary benefits has been extended to people with disabilities. This measure complements the existing employment supports which are available through the NRB and which are of particular importance to people with disabilities in gaining access to the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that many people with disabilities are not in a position to engage in such employment. Accordingly, additional measures have been taken to facilitate these people so that they can engage in other forms of employment and training, such as sheltered or rehabilitative employment.  In this regard, the 1998 budget provided for a significant increase, from £36.30 to £50, in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded for means <Col N="482" /> test purposes in the case of the disability allowance and blind person's pension schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition, provision exists whereby people with disabilities who are receiving invalidity pension or disability benefit can, with the prior approval of the Department, undertake rehabilitative employment and training opportunities, without any loss of entitlements.  There are over 1,800 people availing of this facility.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget also provides for an extension of the back-to-education programme to people with disabilities.  Under this programme, people with disabilities are entitled to an allowance of £150 towards the cost of books and related expenses.</P>
    <P>The question of making further improvements in the services and supports operated by my Department for people with disabilities is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a higher average contribution of 24 stamps per year is required in respect of retirement pension compared to contributory old age pension; the plans, if any, he has to modify this rule; and if he proposes to extend mixed insurance and pro rata rules to apply equally to retirement and contributory old age pensions.</Quest>

      <P>Under existing legislation, &ldquo;pensionable age&rdquo; is defined as being 66 years of age.  The higher average number of contributions required to qualify for a minimum retirement pension reflects the fact that this pension is payable at age 65, prior to pensionable age being attained.  A person can qualify for a <i>pro rata,</i> mixed insurance retirement pension if he or she satisfies the yearly average condition using a mixture of full rate PRSI contributions and modified rate contributions.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to amend the existing arrangements, I have long stated my commitment to ensuring the most broadly feasible contributory pension coverage to as many categories as possible.  With this in mind, my officials are undertaking a detailed examination and review of all the contribution conditions generally applying to the contributory old age and retirement pensions. I hope to have a report of this in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are complex and raise fundamental questions regarding the number of contributions, both paid and credited, that a person has, the PRSI actually paid in respect of their contributions and their overall value.  Issues of equity and redistribution within the social welfare system also arise to be addressed.</P>

      <P>Mortgage payments are not taken into account in determining means for non-contributory old age pension purposes.  Specific assistance towards mortgage payments is provided under the social welfare system through mortgage interest supplements which are payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The scheme provides assistance towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  Under the scheme, a weekly or monthly supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest payments to any person in the State, including those receiving non-contributory old age pension, whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.  The actual rate of supplement payable depends on the interest rate charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstance, the provision of additional assistance to social welfare recipients by way of <Col N="485" /> disregards in respect of mortgage payments under the means-tested social assistance payments, including the old age non-contributory pension scheme, is not considered necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is involved in a wide range of working groups, committees, etc.  and also has on-going business liaisons with other Departments and agencies who deliver a complementary service.  The following are the details requested by the Deputy in relation to the relevant bodies currently operating under the aegis of my Department.  The composition of each body is outlined in Appendix A.</P>
      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the National Social Service Board, the Pensions Board and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>The National Social Service Board was established in 1984 and comprises of 15 members.  The board is responsible for the development and provision of information and advice on social services for citizens throughut the country.  The NSSB publishes an annual report each year, the most recent being published this month.  I will shortly be announcing details of the membership of the new board.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board was set up under the Pensions Act, 1990.  It is a representative body comprising a chairperson and fourteen ordinary members.  The membership of the board comprises representatives nominated by trade unions, employers, Departments, the pensions industry, member trustees and professional groups involved with occupational pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and pension developments generally; and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to the functions assigned to the board and on matters relating to pensions generally.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board published its report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative &mdash; entitled &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;&mdash; in May last. On publication, I circulated a copy of the report to all members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main functions of the Combat Poverty Agency are to advise the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty.  The agency was established in September 1986 and there are currently 16 members on the board.  The agency also establishes subcommitees from time to time.  The agency publishes <Col N="487" /> a large volume of reports each year including an annual report; details of these are included in Appendix B.</P>
    <P>The Steering Committee for the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity was set up in May 1998 to assist my Department in the preparation of the proposed White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity.  Eighteen people drawn from a range of relevant agencies and Government Departments and from the voluntary sector participate in the group in addition to four representatives from my own Department.  I hope to be in a position to publish the White Paper early next year.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Women's Access to Labour Market Opportunities was established in 1997 under Partnership 2000 to review the question of access by women to labour market opportunities with a view to improving gender equity. The group is comprised of 13 members, representative of the four pillars of Partnership 2000 and relevant Government Departments.  It held its first meeting in October 1997.</P>
    <P>A Small Business Forum was set up in December 1997 between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners to consider how the administration of the social welfare and PAYE systems can be improved and simplified.  It was decided to set up a Business Users Panel comprising of employers, representatives from employer organisations and public servants to examine these matters.  The Business User Panel has a total of 19 members.  The panel held its first meeting on 9 October 1998.  The panel is a consultative and not a report issuing body.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental working group to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes was set up by the Government in May 1997 to examine the treatment of one and two-parent families under the tax and social welfare systems.  The group is expected to submit its report to the Minister early next year.</P>
    <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) inter-departmental policy-committee was reconstituted following the launch of the NAPS in April 1997.  The committee is chaired jointly by the Departments of An Taoiseach and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The role of this committee is to support and assist in the implementation of the NAPS at an administrative level.</P>
    <P>The Community Development Programme Advisory Committee was established in December 1994 as an advisory committee to assist in the development of the programme and to advise the Minister on relevant policy matters.</P>
    <P>The Community Development Programme Technical Group was appointed in November 1996.  The group's role is to advise the Minister on applications received from groups for funding under the programme and to assist the Department in drawing up a list of 30 priority areas/communities of interest to be targeted for <Col N="488" /> the development of new projects over the next three years as provided for in Partnership 2000. The membership of the group is drawn from the CDP projects, supports agencies, Combat Poverty Agency and area development management (ADM).</P>
    <P>A National Advisory Committee for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, on which projects and other parties in the money advice and budgeting service are represented, advises the Minister on policy in relation to MABS.</P>
    <P>Prior to the transfer in 1996 of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme renamed disability allowance, from the health boards to the Department, a forum of the principal organisations and service providers representing people with disabilities was established to ensure that all aspects and implications of the transfer were discussed. The forum has continued in operation and has since been broadened to include issues concerning invalidity pension and carer's allowance as well as other matters relevant to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>An Interdepartmental Management Committee on Integrated Social Services System to advise and progress the development of the integrated social services system was first established on 22 April 1994.  The group published its report in August 1994.  The group published its report in August 1996 on the development of an integrated social services system and now has the responsibility of overseeing and progressing its recommendations. Membership of the group comprises representatives of several Government departments and a representative from the health boards.</P>
    <P>My Department is also engaged in a programme of expenditure reviews in a number of different areas and working groups have been set up, with representatives of other relevant Departments to assist the process.</P>

      <P>Dúchas the Heritage Service of my Department operates sluices on the stretch of the Shannon river at Clonown, Athlone, in order to retain an adequate water depth for navigation purposes during the summer months.  I am advised, however, that these sluices which are opened in the winter, have no effect on winter flood levels.  The winter flooding occurs because the river channel is incapable of adequately conveying the large volumes of water which arise in times of prolonged heavy rainfall.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 195 of 9 June 1998 on this matter.  I am aware that concerns have been expressed regarding the proposed change of use of this building from that of an engineering laboratory to a small public performance venue for the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that the conversion of this building which currently resembles a small industrial factory to a public recital venue is fully justified. If the project is completed then significant restoration work will be carried out to the interior of this building which will reveal many of its interesting features and will arrest any further deterioration.  The use of the building as a public performance venue under the aegis of the National Concert Hall will facilitate access to and appreciation of the building for the first time ever by the general public.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the design for the proposed recital venue will not disturb, but will in fact improve and utilise, many of the original features of the interior of the building, including the black limestone floor, the roof trusses and roof lighting and the unique limestone clad walls.  It is planned to retain and restore all these existing elements which comprised part of the original indoor tennis court, in such a way that will not preclude conversion back to its original use at some future date.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 7 of 15 October last. An application for a licence under the National Monuments Acts was received in my Department on 9 November 1998 from the <i>Asgard</i> restoration project to carry out certain alterations to the <i>Asgard</i> vessel.  In accordance with normal procedures the application was forwarded to the National Museum of Ireland for consideration and recommendation in the first instance.  In view of the complex nature of the application and its subject matter, it is not possible to state definitively when this examination will be finalised.</P>

      <P>: Commonage framework plans for each individual commonage are likely to take some time to prepare.  In the interim for 1999, <Col N="494" /> the Department of Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with my Department is implementing measure A of the rural environment protection scheme, with a reduction of mountain ewe quota premiums of 30 per cent of 1998 levels pending the introduction of the individual plans.</P>

      <P>The cultural collecting institutions under my aegis, as part of their normal collecting function, are regularly appraised as to sales of artefacts and collections that might be appropriate to have included in their respective collections.  In this regard the National Museum and National Gallery already hold what they consider to be certain key items for their needs from the collection of the late Sybil Connolly and &ldquo;The Swiss Cottage&rdquo; located near Cahir, County Tipperary, which is owned by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department was decorated by her. The various collecting institutions are aware that other effects belonging to her are to be sold at auction shortly.  I understand that the residence of the late Sybil Connolly is not for sale.</P>

      <P>The proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs) refer to ecological areas of national interest and are proposals only at this stage.  I intend to provide powers to designate such areas as NHAs in the forthcoming amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1996.  I will regulate these areas through Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.  Dúchas has agreed appropriate farming practices in these areas in respect of blanket bog, heath and upland grasslands; the Burren and sand dunes and Machairs with the Department of Agriculture and Food, farming organisations and non-Governmental conservation organisations.  Negotiations are continuing in respect of other habitats (callows, raised bogs, turloughs and intensive grasslands used by geese).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are an EU designation covering Sites of Community Interest and are a requirement of the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).  The directive <Col N="495" /> requires all such sites to have their ecological interest conserved.  The directive was transposed into national law in February 1997 through the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  Under these regulations, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department has issued all known landowners and land users in these sites with a list of activities requiring my consent where such activities may cause damage to the ecological interest of SACs.  The farming practices agreed for NHAs also apply to SACs.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that of these nine superintendents, one retired and eight were subsequently transferred to other districts.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that there are no general rules govenring the length of time that a member of the Garda Síochána serves at any centre. Transfers, for instance, may be temporary or permanent in nature and implemented in the best interests of the service.  Movement of members will arise for a variety of reasons, including the exigencies of the service, promotion and special unforeseen circumstances.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that, while the length of service of a superintendent in a particular district should be of sufficient duration to permit continuity in dealing with ongoing problems, this can be difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have advised that it is hoped to increase the length of service of superintendents in Cobh Garda district and that they are currently addressing this issue with a view to having it finalised in the near future.</P>

      <P>Assistance for the development of private golf courses over the past ten years has been essentially linked to strategy for tourism product development.  The first Operational Programme for Tourism, which covered the 1989-93 period provided funding for golf courses which complied with certain tourism development criteria. The current operational programme, which concludes at the end of 1999, also makes limited provision for the allocation of grants to golf courses.  Measure 4 of the product development sub-programme notes that considerable capacity now exists to faciliate increases in overseas golf visitors, and so only provides for a small amount of funds to be made available, on an exceptional basis, to assist the development of a limited number of new championship courses in remote areas where they could become the catalyst to encourage tourism development.  The provision or improvement of visitor and learner facilities in Bord Fáilte-branded gold courses, which have not received assistance for such improvements under the previous operational programme, have also been eligible for consideration for funding under the current programme.</P>
      <P>Funding has been available, on a broadly similar basis, under the INTERREG programmes, which apply to the Border areas only.</P>

      <P>There is a very distinct difference between a substitute teacher and a temporary teacher.  The former is appointed to replace a teacher absent on paid leave while the latter is appointed to a vacancy pending the permanent filling of the vacancy by open competition.  Substitute teachers are paid a daily flat rate of pay while temporary teachers are paid by reference to an incremental salary scale.</P>
      <P>It appears that the person to whom the Deputy refers was offered a substitute post by the managerial authorities of the school whereas the capacity of the appointment should have been temporary.  While the person's qualifications are acceptable for the purposes of providing substitution, they are unacceptable for the purposes of providing temporary trained service with the resultant differing rates of pay.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy has requested is currently being compiled within my Department.  I will arrange to have my officials forward it directly to Deputy Bruton as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil (£15 per pupil in respect of each service), to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of caretaking and clerical services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision already.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure you that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services until such time as all primary schools with 100 pupils or more are assisted under the scheme.</P>

      <P>No private contributions have been received to date to the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund.  However, the Deputy will note that the fund has enabled institutions to raise significant private funding on foot of the State's commitment.  In this, one of the key objectives of the fund is working very successfully. I expect that last week's announcement re research will add further to this.  In this respect, I would direct the Deputy's attention to the response of the Chairperson of the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence on behalf of school principals in Youghal, and has examined the transport service to the post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>Central set-down and pick-up points are a feature of the school transport scheme in towns with more than one post-primary school.  Only where a school is a considerable distance from the town centre can the question of extending the service to or from the school itself be considered.</P>
      <P>The central set-down/pick-up point is located 0.4 miles from each of the schools.  In 1995, the morning service was extended in order to eliminate the need for pupils of Coláiste Eoin and Christian Brothers' secondary school to walk up a steep hill to school.  The present situation, therefore, is that these pupils are transported directly to their schools each morning, and are required to walk a distance of 0.4 miles downhill in the evenings.  This is considered to be quite a reasonable level of service in the context of the school transport scheme.  It is estimated that it would cost more than £2,000 per annum to pick up these pupils at their schools in the evenings, and in the circumstances I regret that such an additional cost could not be justified.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing exemption from the study of Irish are circularised to schools in the form of a circular letter.  The regulations contain provision for children who previously resided overseas and subsequently enrol in primary and second level schools in the State.</P>
      <P>At primary and second level, pupils may be allowed exemption from the study of Irish in the following circumstances: (i) pupils whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland; (ii) pupils who were previously enrolled as recognised pupils who are being re-enrolled at second level after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the pupil is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment.</P>
      <P>Pupils in second level may be allowed to substitute any other approved subject for Irish in order to make up the minimum number of subjects to be studied.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of primary and second-level schools have been delegated authority by the Department to grant exemption in accordance with prescribed procedures and criteria and subject to monitoring by the Department.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have details of the number of children with hearing or visual impairment in primary and second level schools in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Children with hearing or visual impairment have access to a range of special education services. In some cases, the severity of the impairment may be such that placement in a special dedicated school or a special class is the most appropriate response.  In other cases, the child may be capable of functioning successfully in an integrated setting with an element of special support. Such support may take the form of the resource teacher service or the visiting teacher service or additional part-time teaching hours. My Department also funds special equipment for children with hearing or visual impairment in first and second-level schools.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new development in the provision of special education services. A key element of this initiative is the introduction of a formalised system of special support for children attending school on an integrated basis who have been assessed as having a special need.  Under this initiative, all such children whether in groups or in isolated settings, will have an entitlement to special support.  The nature of the support will be determined by the specific needs of the child.</P>
      <P>Any application for support for hearing or visually impaired children in the area referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of this initiative.</P>

      <P>As a guideline, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make <Col N="527" /> their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
      <P>Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme, as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>An application for transport was examined by my Department in respect of the family in question. The pupils concerned live 0.7 miles from the present pick-up point.  As this is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the overall context of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department to re-route the school bus as requested.</P>

Initially <Col N="530" /> candidates were deemed ineligible for grant assistance if they already held an NCVA level 2 or level 3 qualification, a third level qualification at national certificate, national diploma, degree, post-graduate or equivalent level.  Subsequently it was decided, in line with the practice in the third level student support schemes, to allow for progression from NCVA level 2 courses to NCVA level 3 courses.  Therefore anyone who has already completed an NCVA level 2 course and is now progressing to pursue a course at NCVA level 3 is eligible to apply for grant assistance under the maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>I do not have any plans at present to remove the general restriction on student support schemes whereby students who have attained a certain qualification level are not grant aided for subsequent courses taken at the same qualification level.</P>
      <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that there are no tuition fees payable by the students on approved post-leaving certificate courses.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he has received a request from Presentation primary school, Midleton, County Cork, to appoint a home school liaison teacher and a concessionary resource teacher; the action, if any, he has taken or will take in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator, a concessionary teaching post and a resource teacher post.</P>
      <P>Concessionary teaching posts were traditionally allocated to schools which secured disadvantaged area status.  However, such status has not been granted additional primary schools for some years.  A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The study noted that such status had already been extended to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to further expanding the disadvantaged areas scheme, the study recommended that available resources be focused on schools already included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme is targeted on schools which already have disadvantaged status.  I recently allocated 26 additional co-ordinator posts to this service.  A total of 133 coordinators are now in place in the home-school-community liaison scheme and serving 225 national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resource teacher posts are allocated to support ordinary teaching staff in catering for special needs children in integrated settings.  I recently <Col N="531" /> allocated 26 such posts to national schools.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in the provision of special education services. A key element of this initiative is the introduction of a formalised system of special support for all children attending school on an integrated basis who have been assessed as having a special need.  Under this initiative, all such children whether in groups or in isolated settings, will have an entitlement to special support.  The nature and level of support will be determined by the specific needs of the children.</P>
    <P>The case made by the school in question for a resource teacher post will now be considered in the context of this new development in special needs provision.</P>
    <P>I can also assure the Deputy that the needs of this school will be be fully considered in the context of any additonal resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>My Department issued guidlines to all primary schools in 1991 and to post-primary schools in 1992.  These guidelines were drawn up in consulation with the education partners, and cover suspected child abuse either external or internal to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines make clear that the role of the school authorities is to ensure that suspicions or allegations of child abuse should be reported to the health authorities or the Garda.  My Department does not conduct investigations to establish the veracity or otherwise of allegations of sexual abuse.  As pointed out in the guidelines this is the responsibility of the health authorities and the Garda.  While my Department does not have details of the number of such allegations over the past 20 years, it ensures that allegations which are brought to its attention are reported to the proper statutory authorities.  Such allegations would also be brought to the attention of the managerial authorities of the relevant schools, who have a responsibility for the safety and well being of the pupils entrusted to their care.  The question of <Col N="532" /> suspension of a teacher who is the subject of an allegation of sexual abuse is a matter for the managerial authorities of the school.</P>
    <P>A working party, representative of the education partners, is currently examining the guidelines issued to schools with a view to ensuring that they remain relevant to the situations faced by teachers in their classrooms.  Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party. In addition my officials have held discussions with representatives of the Working Group to Review the Child Abuse Guidelines which has been established by the Department of Health and Children.  It is the intention to issue updated guidelines to schools once that group has completed its final report, which is due at the end of February, 1999.  I am satisfied that this type of close co-operation between the health boards, the partners and my Department will ensure that the welfare of the children is safeguarded.</P>

Provision has been made for a £7 increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant for voluntary secondary schools.  In addition, the rate of grant provided by my Department for the provision of secretarial services was increased from £25 to £30 per pupil, with effect from 1 September 1997, with a new maximum grant of £10,500.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that, under the Technology Integration Initiative, TII, element of the Schools IT 2000 programme, each eligible second level school received a basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil in May this year, with top-up amounts being provided in the case of schools with special classes.</P>

      <P>The position is that arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement.  The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of the work of payment has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering <Col N="536" /> phone queries between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. in the case of secondary teachers, and between 2.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. in the case of primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The agreement of November 1997, to which the Deputy refers, relates to a Government decision in November 1997 that public service pensioners who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the PCW agreement should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis, subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who already received an advance payment of 1 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government decision, an increase of 2 per cent in their pensions has already been paid to teachers who retired before 1 July 1994 &mdash; the earliest commencement date in the case of teachers of the PCW restructuring pay deals.  The retired teachers in question are due the balance, if any, which arises as a result of the implementation of the PCW agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before the end of the year.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due by the end of the year, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reading recovery early intervention programme and of its adoption on a trial basis in many different countries.</P>
      <P>The training of teachers in the recommended methods of reading recovery is intensive, timeconsuming and expensive.  The implementation of the programme requires intensive, one-to-one teaching of pupils who are identified with poor reading achievements at about six years of age.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any organised pilot scheme in the use of the reading recovery programme in this country, although individual remedial teachers may be using aspects of it in their work.</P>
      <P>Research evidence, while indicating the effectiveness of reading recovery with children at six years of age, is less definitive about its long-term effectiveness.  Bearing that in mind and the overall cost of the programme, it is not felt that it is appropriate at this time to introduce it here.

      <P>My Department has made further inquiries regarding the course with Limerick Institute of Technology and has been advised by the institute as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes to the course in Limerick Institute of Technology leading to the College Professional Diploma in Architectural Technology <Col N="538" /> were the outcome of a prolonged and detailed revision within the institute and in response to the views expressed by external advisers and examiners and approved by the governing body.</P>
    <P>The industrial review process, which included a practising architectural technician and other appropriate building industry professionals, also endorsed these changes.  As this course has a link to the B.Sc. degree from Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, the board of studies of the university has reviewed the new structure and the changes to date were approved.</P>
    <P>The first year students on this course are fully aware of the nature, structure and content of this course and the institute has a contractual obligation to them.  The second and third year students who enrolled under the old syllabus will complete their course in accordance with that syllabus.</P>
    <P>With regard to the views of the profession in the matter, it is understood that at a meeting between the institute and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland on 29 September 1998, agreement was reached and confirmed by the RIAI in the following terms:</P>
    <P>1.  The RIAI regarded Limerick Institute of Technology's pre-existing course in architectural technology as the model for the education of architectural technicians.</P>
    <P>2.  The RIAI fully accepts the right of Limerick Institute of Technology to change the structure and/or content of its course.</P>
    <P>3.  The RIAI would wish the new four-year course to produce an output at least as good as the graduates of the pre-existing course.</P>
    <P>4.  The RIAI would be concerned that the views of architectural practices be taken into account in the redesign of the architectural technology stream of the new course.</P>
    <P>5.  The RIAI wishes to maintain effective communications with LIT.</P>
    <P>To this end, it was agreed at our meeting that:</P>
    <P>LIT will send course details of the new programme to the RIAI by December 1998;</P>
    <P>LIT will keep the RIAI informed of developments as appropriate;</P>
    <P>The RIAI will visit the school for a review of the programme in the year 2000, when the first entrants to the new programme will have completed the first two years of the new course;</P>
    <P>The RIAI will send an RIAI Visiting Board to LIT in the year 2002, when the first cycle of the new programme has been completed.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take take the form of full or part-time teacher support or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>Applications for child care support, including the case mentioned by the Deputy, are currently being considered by my Department in the context of this new development in special needs provision. I am confident that an early and positive response will issue in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation, as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.  The inflation figure, as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998, was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was, therefore, increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-9 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics <Col N="540" /> Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-9 academic year were, therefore, increased by 3.2 per cent.  This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the European Social Fund aided maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certifcate courses, an &ldquo;approved course&rdquo; means a full-time post leaving certificate course of at least one year duration which is approved by the Minister for Education and Science for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have approved all the post leaving certificate courses which are funded under the ESF arrangements for inclusion in the maintenance grants schemes.  There are courses provided in voluntary secondary schools which are included in these arrangements.  The criteria which determine the inclusion of post leaving certificate courses in the ESF arrangements include such considerations as the entry level to the course, the duration of the course, the level of training provided on the course, the relevance of the course content to labour market needs, the work experience and placement arrangements, the links with outside agencies, adequate resourcing and quality assurance procedures.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that there are no tuition fees payable by students attending approved post leaving certificate courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The abridged Estimates which were published recently do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure.  It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up-to-date outturn figures. <Col N="541" /> Moreover, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.  This process will extend over the next number of months and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years, instituted by the last Government, to increase maintenance grants in line with changes in the consumer price index.  Similarly, the reckonable income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the level of increase in maintenance grants and income limits will be considered early next year in the context of the annual review of these schemes and in the light of the Central Statistics Office data relating to <Col N="542" /> wage and price inflation.  At this stage, 1999 abridged Estimates include provision for indexation.</P>
