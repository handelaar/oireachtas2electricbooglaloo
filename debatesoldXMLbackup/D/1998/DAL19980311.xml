      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the present position on the family law Bill?  That Bill is to facilitate pension adjustments in the case of separations that occur.  They occur all the time and this legislation should come into effect quickly so that the same rules will apply to all cases.  What is the timetable for the introduction of that Bill and will it have retrospective effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton said, the Bill is to make provision for pension adjustments in the context of separation agreements.  It is at a fairly early stage of drafting.  I do not have a precise date as to when it will be ready as it is only at a preliminary stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to do that.  Mr. Murphy has spent 50 hours taking evidence from various people and has had various interviews.  He now has 1,300 pages of print on this.  He is dealing with all the matters concerned in a painstaking and comprehensive way and hopes to complete his final report by the end of the month.  We should wait until that report is published.  He will continue his work for a number of days because he wants to speak to a small number of people who wish to speak to him. Everyone is co-operating with him for which I am grateful.</P>

      <P>The people of Wexford and one of the Taoiseach's backbenchers are outraged by that political decision.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the next industry of this size that wishes to locate here will be given to County Wexford because the people of Wexford deserve fair treatment and fair play?  Does the Taoiseach have any answer on this issue?</P>

      <P>I want to confirm something the Taoiseach said in reply to a question posed by Deputy Bruton.  I understand from the Taoiseach that the Government intends to hold the referendum on the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty on 22 May.  Do I take it that it is also the Government's intention to combine that with a referendum to give effect to any settlement which may emerge in respect of the talks in Northern Ireland?</P>

In view of the reformulated proposals from EU Commissioner Mr. Santer, which are considerably worse than the original ones, when will the Taoiseach provide time for a full scale debate on the impact of the proposals which, as formulated, would have a devastating effect on rural Ireland?</P>

      <P>On two occasions last year, the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that the School Attendance Bill would be ready early this year. This is an important Bill.  Anyone can see that children, who should be at school, are begging on O'Connell Bridge every day.  What has delayed this legislation and why will the Bill not be ready until the second half of this year?  Is this legislation not a priority for the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister questioned the wisdom of penalising parents in socially disadvantaged areas as being the way forward and has stated that a more caring philosophy should be adopted.  There are multiple causes of disadvantage in such areas and using the force of the law against unfortunate children and their parents is not the only factor which should be considered. The Minister will reflect that in any legislation which is published.  I am sure he has the support of many Members in the House in his caring approach.</P>

      <P>The section as originally drafted precluded seafarers on ships which service rigs at sea from claiming the new allowance.  Following publication of the section, I received representations outlining that the crews on such ships are no different from crews on cross-channel ferries and that ships servicing rigs often undertake voyages of longer duration.  Having considered the matter, the representations are merited and seafarers on ships servicing rigs at sea should be put on an equal footing with seafarers generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the allowance as initiated specifically excluded seafarers on ships servicing rigs at sea.  The original purpose of this section was to give the seafarer's allowance to seafarers &mdash; those who are employed on ferries and spend time abroad.  I wanted to bring us in line with other countries. The original purpose of the seafarer's allowance was for that particular segment of the market. However, I received a number of representations seeking to extend the allowance to this other category. It was originally targeted at a specific group.  As other Deputies know, these representations have been made for a considerable period of time and the previous Minister for Finance did not accede to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having pledged during the election campaign and on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to introduce some relief for cross-Border workers, in equity I also had to extend the seafarer's allowance. The original section as drafted was targeted at seafarers, which include those employed on <Col N="917" /> most cross-channel ferry ships.  Representations were made for this category of worker and I tabled this amendment.</P>
    <P>I agreed following representations that there was some merit in allowing certain seafarers on ships servicing rigs at sea to qualify for the new allowance.  As with all allowances, the conditions attached must have some cut-off point.  In this case, only those seafarers working on ships which service rigs outside the areas designated by order under section 2 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, will qualify for the new allowance.  The reason for this cut-off point is straightforward. The allowance is for seafarers who work on ships going to foreign ports.  I do not consider rigs at sea in an area in which the State has rights over the seabed and sub-soil, for the purpose of exploring them and exploiting their natural resources, to be a foreign port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment.  During my tenure as Minister for the Marine, I endeavoured to have this change made.  This could not be done until the cross-Border workers problem was resolved. Combined with the efforts of the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, who amended the PRSI provision in relation to seafarers, we have a package which will help create employment in that sector.</P>
      <P>Whatever changes are needed should be made in the context of promoting employment and allowing Irish shipowners to compete with what is available abroad.  I ask the Minister, in introducing the amendment, to update or change in the future in order to retain our competitive position. I am confident that, as a result of the changes made by the last Government as regards PRSI and this Government as regards PAYE, we will put ourselves in a more competitive position which will allow greater opportunities for employment for Irish seafarers.</P>

This measure will provide a more level playing field to Irish shipowners in giving employment to Irish crews.  I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment tabled by Deputy Rabbitte and me by expanding this amendment to cover the category to which he referred.  It is a good and progressive move for Irish shipping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those sentiments. However, will the Minister address my point about excluding vessels on the continental shelf? To what provision does the preclusion of vessels working on the territory of the continental shelf relate?  Perhaps he can explain this as I cannot see it in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand some of the companies involved have met with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and that certain undertakings were given.  It does not matter whether one is <Col N="918" /> working ten or 300 miles off the coast &mdash; the same competitive factor in terms of labour recruited obtains.  For example, the oil rig off Kinsale, County Cork, is in the territory of the continental shelf.  They are competing with Croatians, Norwegians, British and Dutch for labour.  The argument equally applies here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can explain this because there was a definite expectation from the meetings between these companies and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, that this element would be included. Only following the publication of the amendment have they discovered it is excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for his remarks.  As he correctly stated, previous efforts to introduce a seafarer's allowance were continuously resisted.  When I was in Opposition I received representations on the introduction of this allowance but the then Minister said it could not be introduced until the problems with cross-Border workers had been resolved.  Given that I have moved to deal with these problems, I have decided in the interests of equity to introduce this allowance.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, this amendment will delete lines 41 to 45 which exclude oil rigs. Following publication of the section I received representations from people who wanted oil rigs included, which is the purpose of the amendment.  Under the amendment a seafarer's allowance will be given to people who attend &mdash; I do not know if this is the correct maritime term &mdash; at foreign ports.  Given that the State has rights over the sea bed and the subsoil of the Continental Shelf for the purposes of exploration it is not regarded as a foreign port.  The proposals in the amendment mirror the position in other countries.  One of the reasons I tabled the amendment is to ensure competitiveness. I received representations from Government Deputies regarding this matter and I have gone as far as is feasibly possible at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 22, line 28, to delete &ldquo;183 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;169 days, or such greater number of days as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, may from time to time, by order made for the purposes of the subsection, substitute for that number of days (or, as the case may be, for the number of days substituted by the last previous order under this subsection),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section as originally drafted stipulated that a seafarer had to be outside the State for 183 days to qualify for the allowance.  Following publication of this section the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources received representations which claimed that the 183 day trigger for the allowance was not attainable in the current industrial relations productivity environment. Having considered the matter, I propose to reduce the number of days a seafarer is required to be outside the State to 169.  However, I reserve the right to increase the figure at a later date by way of ministerial order following consultation with the Minster for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1) Section 787(8)(a) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of &lsquo;20 per cent&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;25 per cent&rsquo;.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to promote personal funding of retirement pensions.  We are all aware of the difficulties looming on the horizon in terms of the ability of the State and individuals to adequately fund pension requirements in the future.  No one can say for certain when the bubble will burst, but in any event it is incumbent on the Government and advisable to promote the highest level of private pension provision possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to increase the allowable percentage of relevant earnings invested in pension schemes from 20 per cent to 35 per cent for people over 55 and from 15 to 20 per cent for people under 55.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to this proposal. Of course, everything has a price tag and clearly this will lead to a loss of revenue for the Exchequer.  However, it would be small when compared with the encouragement given to people to invest more of their savings in pension <Col N="920" /> funds.  Given that people are living longer and the questions which arise about the State's ability to meet its pension requirements, this is a prudent and sensible proposal which is in keeping with the Minister's thinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand where Deputy Coveney and Fine Gael are coming from, but I am nervous about this proposal.  Pension funds are major players in the stock markets both here and abroad and are taking on a size not envisaged many years ago.  They are getting this money because tax relief is given to people to invest in them.  I have no problem with this in principle, but there is not sufficient control over what pension funds do with the money made available to them.  Some years ago the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, attempted in talks with the pension funds to encourage the investment of the funds in stocks and shares and investment funds in Ireland.  Is the Minister satisfied that everything possible is being done to direct the funds available to pension funds into productive investment, particularly in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The views I express are mine, not those outlined in representations.  Given what is happening in this area, I support the amendment. The legislation which sets out the restrictions and levels of contributions was enacted at a time when people retired from their permanent pensionable employment at 65 years, having worked for the same firm for 40 or 45 years.  However, that day is gone, except perhaps for those employed in the public sector where there are certain guarantees.</P>
      <P>The level of contribution paid by those in private enterprise or by the self-employed depends on the state of one's business or profession at a particular time.  People are now being encouraged to retire before they reach 65 years. I am sure that, like me, the Minister for Finance intends doing this.  Many people are encouraged to retire at 55 years.  The practice of funding for a maximum of two-thirds of one's final salary is no longer feasible.  If people want to retire early there should be provision whereby they can fund up to 110 or 120 per cent of their final salary.  It will not be too long before things catch up because most pension schemes do not have built in escalation provisions.  The level of contribution needs to be larger in order to build up a greater fund, have more flexibility in pensions and make provision for widows and children.  If people retire early there is a likelihood they could leave a widow at an early age, perhaps with young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers a pension fund one has to ask what one can provide for it.  Should one build <Col N="921" /> in escalation for one's personal pension and has one made proper provision for widows and children at the point when the fund is cashed in? Deputy Coveney suggested that we should allow an increase in the level of contributions.  If somebody over funds a pension scheme they cannot just put money into their pocket and walk away. It will not be subject to preferential tax treatment.</P>
    <P>I hear much talk about companies holding all this money, but the money does not belong to the company.  It is taxable the same as any other form of company profit, so the State gets its money back.  We are moving towards the day when everyone, no matter what employment they are in, will have their own pension fund which they will bring with them when they move from one job to another.  The day is disappearing when everybody contributed to one big pension fund.</P>
    <P>The majority of people joining the workforce today will not work in the same place for 40 years. Because of changes in technology there will be greater movement of labour.  I know the Pensions Board and other expert groups are examining the pension system on behalf of the Government, but that will not engender the political will to allow a greater contribution to the fund.  As politicians, we must recognise that society has changed from the days when people retired at 65 and were buried a few years later in Dean's Grange.  That day has gone.  Irrespective of what advice politicians receive from various experts, dealing with people on a daily basis we know that the income of someone who retires at the age of 55 or 58 may be grand for the first four or five years, but after that things start getting a bit tight, especially if their pension scheme is self-funded.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that a married woman's pension is halved when her husband dies.  The system wrongly assumes that all her responsibilities, including bills, are suddenly halved.  The legislation is crazy.  Why should a widow not be entitled to carry on receiving the same pension as her husband had, if it has been paid for from day one?  Why should we tell widows they will only receive half what their late husbands received?  It is ridiculous.  The costs of running a household do not necessarily halve because one of the spouses dies.  We should look at the realities of life, particularly the case of widows left with young children who have to exist on very low pensions.  It is appalling to see the low pensions that widows of Members of this House, who served here for 30 years, receive.  It is the same throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>It is time we started looking at modern day living. We should realise that this is not a way of beating the tax system, it is a way of funding a decent standard of living for people who may have to retire early and a decent income for a spouse, with children, who has been unfortunate to lose a partner.  The whole system should be modernised.  The 15 per cent restriction on maximum pension contributions is senseless.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The Minister has his feet on the ground and he deals with ordinary people.  He should seriously examine this issue and accede to what Deputy Coveney has suggested by accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may surprise Deputies, but I am firmly in the camp of Deputies Barrett and Coveney as regards this matter &mdash; so much so, in fact, that in my time as Minister for Finance I have gone about making some changes in this regard.  I had a separate paragraph in the budget saying I would deal with pensions because I feel strongly about the matter.  I would have made some changes in the recent budget but for the fact that I felt obliged to await the pensions report from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  We have received an interim report and the final report should be available in the next month or so.  I will return to some of the points raised by Deputies in a moment.</P>
      <P>The current lower level of relief at 15 per cent is based on retirement arrangements being made over a normal working life of 40 years and it is quite adequate for that purpose.  Difficulties arise where, for whatever reason, provision is not made until well into a working life.  To try to cater for this situation my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, increased the level in 1996 to 20 per cent for those aged 55 or over.  Some 69,500 individuals out of 142,000 schedule D taxpayers currently avail of relief at an estimated cost next year of £53.3 million. The average deduction for all claimants is 9 per cent compared to the upper limits of 15 to 20 per cent.  Only about 15.5 per cent of claimants contribute close to the appropriate threshold. Accordingly, any increase in the existing levels of relief will not benefit the vast bulk of claimants who are not, for whatever reason, availing of current entitlements and will do absolutely nothing for the considerably large number of self-employed who, for whatever reasons, apparently have no formalised pension provisions.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs jointly launched a pensions initiative in autumn 1996 to examine the whole area of pension provisions and to make recommendations for appropriate changes.  The report's initiatives are currently being finalised and will be available shortly.  The Government will study the report and take whatever action is required.</P>
      <P>We had a debate about this on Committee Stage when I gave my views on this matter.  They are very much in line with the suggestions made by Deputy Barrett.  I fundamentally believe that if we do not make changes in this area and encourage people to make pension provisions for themselves, the State will be faced with a horrendous problem.  Deputy Barrett said that in future everybody will have their own small pension fund and my thinking is geared towards that idea.  That is happening in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were significant changes some years ago following the Pensions Act, 1991, which allowed <Col N="923" /> portability of pensions for those moving from one place of employment to another.  However, the traditional way of looking at pensions is very outdated. The idea of contributing 15 per cent may have been grand for a world where people went to work aged 18 or 20 and stayed in a job for 40 years, but that is no longer the situation.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Finance, an official in my Department has been keeping all the newspaper cuttings relating to pensions.  I am building up a file of expertise on the matter and I may avail of some of the expertise of Deputy Barrett when it comes to finalising my thinking on it. Over the years a number of aspects of the 15 per cent cap as it relates to self-employed people have driven me absolutely wild.  It is quite ridiculous that one is limited to 15 per cent, although I know the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, increased it to 20 per cent.  Unless one starts off very young as a self-employed person, one will not build up an adequate pension fund by the time one comes to retirement age, even if one waits until the age of 65 to retire.  Most self-employed people do not even start thinking about a pension until they are well into their 40s because they are too busy running their business and trying to keep the show on the road.  Self-employed people who have not incorporated themselves into a limited company &mdash; accountants or solicitors in a partnership or a shopkeeper who formed a limited company to run a business &mdash; can put in as much money as they like but they will only get tax relief on 15 per cent.  However, the owners of a similar business which is not incorporated as a limited company can put in as much money as they like and full tax relief is given to the company.  That anomaly has struck me as bizarre for many years.</P>
    <P>The situation becomes even more ridiculous for people who have the option of drawing their pensions between the ages of 60 or 70.  The fund will have built up to a certain amount, they will be allowed to take 25 per cent as a lump sum and the rest must be used to purchase an annuity.  The <i>piece de résistance</i>, however, concerns people who take out an annuity for, say, five years &mdash; the fund could be £300,000 or 400,000 &mdash; and who die after six months.  The fund goes back to the insurance company even though it is the deceased person's money.</P>
    <P>I am sure this will not please some of the insurance companies but over the years I asked the Department the reason for this and the reply was that people should not be allowed to be irresponsible with their own money.  To suggest that self-employed people who have spent 40 years scraping together money to run a business will go wild when they reach the age of 65, dissipate their built-up pension fund and become a burden on the State beggars belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers should not think otherwise.</P>
      <P>Another ridiculous aspect concerns a limited company.  The Revenue Commissioners say the pension will be based on one's salary at the time of retirement and that the salary must be averaged over the last three years.  Other convoluted rules are imposed also.  However, I discovered many years ago that if in regard to a limited company a person had taken out a second pension from some other employment, it is debarred and the person is forced to take back the money even though he or she does not want it.  These rules drawn up in the past have not kept pace with modern times.  Public service pensions, which are index linked, are excellent but if self-employed people want to build up a similar fund and have it index linked, they will have to put in a large amount of money.</P>
      <P>I am giving a clear indication that I intend to move significantly in this regard in next year's Finance Bill, even more dramatically than Deputy Coveney suggests.  As has been done in the United Kingdom, I envisage that people in certain age categories will be allowed have a greater contribution level.  Deputy Barrett has a great deal of expertise in this area and I agree with almost everything he said on this matter, particularly as it related to widows.  I do not understand that aspect although I know it is based on the fact that one person is living on a pension originally intended for two but bills do not stop coming in the door when the other person dies.  I intend to move significantly in this regard in forthcoming budgets.  I do not want to accept this amendment in isolation but I feel strongly about it; I referred to pensions in my contribution on the budget on 3 December.  I intend to make significant changes in this regard in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I raised these matters in a recent discussion with people in the insurance pensions industry. The meeting was not called to discuss pension matters but I availed of the opportunity to outline my thinking in that regard which is as I have outlined and enunciated by Deputies Coveney and Barrett.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Deputy McDowell referred to the fact that my predecessor put pressure on the pension industry to increase its level of investment in Irish equities and business.  That has increased over the years and I understand the total amount of money in pension funds in Ireland is approximately £20 billion, a small proportion of which is in Irish equities and business.  A trustee of a pension fund would want to put their money in a safe operation. The safest trustees of pension funds are State employees or trade union members.  They do not want to take a risk with their money, which is understandable.  When people are coming close to drawing their pension they do not want to invest in something risky.  I understand the reluctance of the pension funds industry over the years to invest in Irish equities.  The figures have somewhat improved, commitments were given by the industry and they were honoured.  I realise there are difficulties in the free market and with due regard having to be given to the prudential operation of pension funds I understand the industry's position.  I am not in a position today to accept Deputy Coveney's amendment but I invite him to watch this space in regard to next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is clearly in free flowing form this morning so perhaps I could elucidate his view on one point and draw him out a little further.  The logic of what the Minister said is that there should not be any constraint or upper limit on the contributions people might make and on the tax relief they should be given.  I assume this limit was imposed in the first instance because the State took the view that we should encourage private provision for pensions up to a certain point and allow tax relief on the provision of a reasonable pension but that if somebody wanted to go to 100 per cent or 110 per cent of salary, as Deputy Barrett suggested, they could top it up at their own cost and there should not be any need to give tax relief for that.  That is a reasonable provision.</P>
      <P>We must make choices as to how we use public funds and if someone is choosing between providing additional moneys to improve the basic contributory social welfare pension and providing additional tax relief for the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; in terms of private pensions, I am clear about where the choice should be made.  I am not suggesting the Minister is not conscious of the need to improve the social welfare contributory pension &mdash; improvements were made in it this year &mdash; but there is some logic in providing a ceiling.  The argument the Minister made would seem to suggest that there should not be a ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally forgotten that income from a pension is taxable the same as earned income.  If I pay into a fund for 120 per cent of my final salary, I pay full tax on all income which is more money for the State.  It is a prudent way of encouraging people to provide for themselves <Col N="926" /> and to give them some incentive.  If they do that well the State gets more income because it is fully taxed.  I cannot see the logic in restricting the level of contribution if the State gets the money back through income tax.  I accept some control must be put on the lump sum that could be taken tax free because that could be an abuse, but if the balance is taken in terms of income by way of an annuity, or if a widow has to draw the amount, she will also have to pay tax. The State will not lose anything by increasing the limits as suggested by Deputy Coveney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine this question in terms of maximum percentages and the quantum. I am willing to consider a number of approaches in this regard.  The percentages could be dealt with subject to maximum relief in pounds terms. Rather than take a percentage of a person's income, it could be decided that in any year they would get tax relief on not more than, say, £50,000.  I am not saying that is the way I will proceed, but it is one approach that could be considered. As Deputy Barrett pointed out, drawing from the fund is the same as getting wages or profits from a business and tax would be payable in any event.  The rules were drawn up at a time when the economy was not progressing as well as it is now, and all those matters may be considered.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy McDowell about the balance between the State support system and the position where people provide for themselves privately, both systems may be easily married. People are entitled to provide for their standard of living post retirement and they should be allowed do so.  If they want to put money into a pension fund rather than into another asset that should be allowed.  Up to the last decade self-employed people could not be convinced to join a pension fund.  They believed their business would do well and they could sell assets or whatever, but in more recent times, perhaps because of the successful selling of the pensions industry, unit funds and the insurance industry, people think somewhat differently.</P>
      <P>I predict that in a few years' time it will be necessary for the State to consider, as has been done in other jurisdictions by parties with which Deputy McDowell is closely aligned, providing an incentive for people other than the self-employed to provide for their pension.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I think most Deputies will agree it would work well.  As Deputy Barrett said, everyone would have their own fund.  In time to come that is the direction in which we will move. I will not be able to address that matter before next year's budget, but I intend to address the anomalies relating to self-employed pensions, company directors' pensions and pension funds so that there will be cohesion in this area.  Hopefully that will lead to further debate.</P>

      <P>In page 26, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with Irish registered non-resident companies.  We had a reasonable debate on this matter on Committee Stage and we established a number of facts that had not been previously in the public domain.  First, we established that we do not know the extent of this phenomenon. The Minister was unable to give the source of the supposed 40,000 such companies registered in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister suggested a source and I was going to ask him whether, as has been intimated to me since by a journalist, it might be the report by the top six accountancy companies for the IDA.  I do not know if the report referred to that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we found out the source.  Second, we agreed the problem has been accelerating here, probably since the United Kingdom decision on the matter.  It constitutes a problem for this country's reputation.  The mechanism of Irish registered non-resident companies is utilised by international companies located here which are engaged in perfectly legitimate <Col N="928" /> commercial business.  The structure is used not only by companies using this jurisdiction to cheat their exchequer but by companies engaged in legitimate business here, and that is the main factor that makes this such a complex problem. We all agreed on Committee Stage it is a complex problem and anybody who pretends to the contrary when dealing with it will establish just how complex it is.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the l995 Act which attempted to deal with this phenomenon.  The more one looks at that Act the greater difficulty one has in finding out what is wrong with it.  It seems a fair attempt to address the phenomenon, but the problem may be summarised as one of implementation and compliance.  It is an entirely different matter to give the Revenue Commissioners power to obtain information on those companies and to put an obligation on the companies to furnish the information to the Revenue. In official scripts and replies to questions on this matter there is naivety that if the Revenue Commissioners continue to send notices and reminders, those companies will respond to them, but that will not happen.  Presumably that enables the Revenue Commissioners to say they are implementing the law, but it has no effect because the people we are going after, who are here either for illegal purposes or merely to cheat their exchequer &mdash; they certainly contribute nothing to the creation of wealth in this jurisdiction in that they do not generate jobs and do not trade here &mdash; will not reply unless they have to.</P>
      <P>Even though there are penalties in the 1995 Act, as the Minister made clear in a parliamentary reply, not a single prosecution has taken place.  The Minister's reply to a parliamentary question I put down on 5 March is interesting and, perhaps because we have learned from the controversy, gives information as distinct from other replies in which efforts are made to conceal information.  It states that since the enactment of the 1995 Act 2,622 companies have identified themselves as neither resident in the State nor carrying on a trade in the State.  I do not know if there is a basis for the figure of 40,000, but the figure given by the Minister is about 6.5 per cent of 40,000.  I do not know whether that is a better estimate or whether there are five times as many such companies.  The Tánaiste and the Minister agreed we do not know the figure, but the phenomenon has been proliferating.</P>
      <P>The Minister defined this phenomenon as where management and control of the company resides.  He said that in the time provided he could not furnish the information I requested, but he gave a sample of cases of the following territories from where this phenomenon originates: Jersey, Sark, Isle of Man, Turkey, Cyprus, Hong Kong and a number of Eastern European countries. He then said that no prosecution has been taken against an Irish registered non-resident company for failure to comply with the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that amounts to a picture of the ineffectual nature of the existing law.  My amendment, in <Col N="929" /> which the Minister concedes there is merit, seeks to make the 1995 Act effective.  It does that in two ways &mdash; it puts the onus on the company within 30 days of incorporation to make that fact known and it makes the company formation agent a mark in the event of non-compliance.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to understand why the Minister would want to reject making the 1995 Act effective pending the introduction of whatever more comprehensive proposals he has in mind.  The point of my amendment is to make some person in this jurisdiction accountable for non-compliance.  There is nobody accountable at present.  The Revenue Commissioners may scatter letters like confetti to these people who are, by definition, outside the jurisdiction.  Quite patently, if their purposes are nefarious in the first place, they will not comply with such requests. Therefore, the Minister must make somebody in this jurisdiction accountable for non-compliance. I submit that the person with whom to do that is the company formation agent.  Make the company formation agent responsible and accountable for non-compliance.  If he does not comply, fine him of the order which I have put in the amendment and fine him further for every day he does not comply.  That would bring them to heel quite quickly.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's intention to deal with this phenomenon and that it is complex.  I accept, therefore, that it will take some time for him to bring forward a more comprehensive package if he can, but why do we permit this phenomenon to prevail in the interim?  Why do we not require those who are setting up these companies for fly by night operators to tell the Companies Office in the first instance and the Revenue Commissioners in the second instance, and that if they do not do so, they are the ones who must account for it?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider and address these two questions of implementation and compliance which are dealt with reasonably in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 48 in my name, which is being discussed with amendment No. 19, was discussed at length on Committee Stage when I accepted that it is a blunt instrument. I do not expect the Minister to accept it here, but it gives us the opportunity to discuss further our view of this particular structure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte correctly identified that there are two ways to approach this matter or, in a sense, two times at which we can approach this matter.  We can approach it at the time of incorporation of the company or shortly thereafter, as Deputy Rabbitte proposed in his amendment, in an attempt to lift the veil of incorporation or we can give the Revenue a general power to investigate certain companies at a later stage.  I believe the latter would be the general effect of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is of course that most of these companies are here primarily just to open bank <Col N="930" /> accounts and, presumably, to lodge money to those bank accounts.  Confidentiality is an extraordinarily important part of their decision in coming here in the first instance.  Last week I spoke to somebody in the Isle of Man who told me that he had opened an account that very morning for a Tanzanian gentleman.  That gentleman does not appear as a director of the company and of course we will never know his identity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of these companies and the accounts opened by them are being used for purposes which are seriously detrimental to the reputation of Ireland and we must do something about it urgently.  The very fact that the Revenue would have the capacity to investigate companies and accounts of this kind would, in itself, scare away much of the hot money and many of the companies which are looking to hide money in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also support what Deputy Rabbitte is trying to do.  As I understand it, he is looking to impose obligations within 30 days of the incorporation of a company.  We had a detailed discussion about this on Committee Stage, but one issue which the Minister did not quite address in his response was what can be done before incorporation.  We should require companies which intend to be non-resident here to declare certain information before we give them their certificate of incorporation. Deputy Rabbitte's amendment provides that this should be done within 30 days and I suppose that would have the same effect, but there would be a greater impetus and urgency about supplying that information if we refused to give the certificate of incorporation until such time as they gave certain information to the Companies Office in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I know that the structure of the incorporation of companies provides for nominee directors, nominee registered offices, etc., but we must make different provision for companies of this kind which we know are being used for nefarious or illegal purposes.  If we are looking at it from a company law point of view, that is the way in which I would like to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with a few specific points which were raised and then with the generality of this particular debate.  We had a good debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  If that debate had been covered at the time in the media, a more rational assessment of this problem would have ensued in the newspapers in subsequent days.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, we have no basis for knowing whether the figure of 40,000 companies is right or wrong and nobody has come forward since the debate on Committee Stage to state that the recent report in a national newspaper to that effect was right or wrong.  I have not met the journalist concerned and it is not her job to state from where she got the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I suggest the figure may have come from a tax article of August 1995.  There were two articles, the first of which was in a British journal <Col N="931" /><i>Taxation.</i>  Another article appeared in <i>Tax Planning International Review</i> in the same year.  Both articles were written by Dr. Michael O'Brien.  A very good article, entitled &ldquo;Ireland's Tax Haven&rdquo;, stated that Dr. O'Brien was Group Managing Director of Williams Geoffrey Barber International, P.O. Box 148, 24 Union Street, St. Helier, Jersey.</P>
    <P>A Dr. Michael J. O'Brien wrote another article the same year.  This time he is described as a member of the executive committee of Edsaco Group, Jersey.  It looks as if both articles were written by the same person because the phraseology is the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sounds like the type of bloke who would not be worried about his pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well written article about offshore companies, etc., and it is well researched. The article states that Edsaco Group was founded in 1980 and has developed into one of the leading trust and international tax advisers in Europe.  I presume this Dr. O'Brien is the same person because the similarities between the two articles are strikingly obvious.  They both contain the same sentences and phrases.</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Brien is an expert on tax law.  He relates how this problem arose, illustrates how the UK changed its laws and details the history of Irish and British tax law from the late 1880s.  I assume it is from this source that recent articles in Irish national newspapers originated.  Dr. O'Brien does not state from where he obtained the figure.  He assumes it might be 40,000.  In an article in <i>Taxation</i> on 31 August 1995, he referred to the Irish question and stated: &ldquo;The Irish company has come to dominate in European terms the offshore tax planning field.  Whilst numbers are difficult to arrive at, it is undoubtedly true that one is looking at 40,000 plus companies.&rdquo; He does not state the origin of this figure or how he worked it out.  In a further article in <i>Tax Planning International Review</i> in August 1995, Dr. O'Brien stated &ldquo;Whilst it is difficult to be precise, it is undoubtedly true that there are more than 40,000 such companies.&rdquo; He uses the same phraseology but does not indicate from where he obtained the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion &mdash; this has not been contradicted since Committee Stage &mdash; that recent reports in Irish newspapers were based on these articles.  Both articles were published in August 1995 and it appears Dr. O'Brien obtained fees from different magazines for basically the same article, which is done by journalists and accountants throughout the world and there is nothing wrong with it.  I am not questioning Dr. O'Brien's bona fides, I am merely trying to place on record the background to this issue.  I am led to believe that Dr. O'Brien's articles formed the basis of the recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Siobhán Creaton which referred to the figure of 40,000 and states &ldquo;Ireland has become one of the <Col N="932" /> favourite European tax havens for thousands of foreign investors.  Up to 40,000 companies are operated here by overseas investors, mainly to hide money from their own tax authorities.&rdquo; She does not state from where she obtained the figure either.  I can only assume that the background to this issue originated from the articles by Michael O'Brien which appeared in the international tax journals to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made the point that this matter may have originated from the review of the top six accounting firms.  I am assured by my officials that the Deputy is incorrect.  They have no knowledge of the origin of the figure of 40,000. We do not know &mdash; I believe no one else does &mdash; how this gentleman arrived at that figure.  I assume the recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> came from the same source and I have not been contradicted on that.  A belief has arisen that there must be 40,000 companies operated here by overseas investors but I do not know the grounds on which this is based.</P>
    <P>The previous Administration introduced its Finance Bill in April 1995 and in fairness to my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, and despite his recent attempts to make political capital in respect of this issue, this matter was addressed in section 58 of that legislation.  However, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, in the background note which formed the basis of that amendment it was obvious that its purpose was to act as a deterrent &mdash; the loophole could not be closed off &mdash; to IRNRs.  As I also pointed out, this was clear from the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the Bill which states &ldquo;The measure is being introduced because certain Irish incorporated non-resident companies have been used for undesirable activities and have brought Irish incorporated companies into disrepute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Long before the articles appeared in the international journals to which I referred earlier, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance were concerned about this matter.  It was for that reason that section 58 was introduced.  In the correspondence between Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte in September 1995, which was recently placed on the record of the House by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Quinn pointed out that that section 58 would not address the problem and proposed that Deputy Rabbitte might consider amendments to other areas of company law.  That is the background to this matter.  Unless someone can prove to me from where the figure of 40,000 originated I must conclude that it came from the journal articles to which I referred.  Unfortunately, those articles fail to indicate from where the figure originated.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the Select Committee it is unfortunate that once the promoters of undesirable companies obtain a certificate of incorporation, they can use the company for their intended purposes which can be then damaging to Ireland's reputation.  It is also a problem that companies can be incorporated in this country without a disclosure of the identities of their <Col N="933" /> owners.  We must be conscious that many Irish incorporated companies are used for legitimate purposes and that such use should not be banned. The Government is committed to finding the right solution to this issue.  Any exclusion will have to be one which does not adversely impact on Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I provided an example whereby non-resident companies are used for legitimate purposes by a number of multinationals. Such use is quite complex and difficult, even for tax experts, to understand.  However, some major multinational companies use this structure for good reasons and this often leads to reinvestment in Ireland.  We do not want to ban such legitimate activities.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks the automatic furnishing of the information required under section 882 of the Taxes Consolidation Act by an IRNR company within 30 days following incorporation.  This seeks to address the fact that under existing law IRNR companies are not obliged to furnish information until they become active or they receive a notice from the Revenue Commissioners.  The fact is that the Revenue Commissioners issue notices requiring information to all newly incorporated companies after they are advised of their incorporation by the Companies Office.  The main difficulty is how to enforce compliance with this notice by IRNR companies.  This is a problem because it is not possible to identify which companies are non-resident from the details furnished to the Companies Office.  Even if it was possible to identify them, IRNR companies do not have assets in the State and are difficult to pursue unless someone in Ireland is accountable for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment attempts to address this aspect by imposing a penalty on the Irish formation agent where a company fails to provide the information.  At the Select Committee I questioned whether the formation agent is the appropriate mark in these circumstances and I stated that this matter requires careful consideration.  In any event, the Deputy's proposed solution would only be effective in so far as an Irish formation is used.  If a foreign agent is used, pursuit of the penalties would be problematic. An alternative approach might be to require a company to have a fiduciary agent in the State as a precondition for registration.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment proposes that a company which is incorporated in the State will be resident here for tax purposes, irrespective of the location of its central management and control or its assets.  Before that suggested approach could be considered as a solution there is a need to ensure that it would not adversely impact on Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct investment. On Committee Stage, the Deputy acknowledged that his proposal may be too broad an approach.  In addition, consideration would have <Col N="934" /> to be given to the question of enforcement of any tax owed by the companies involved.</P>
    <P>I informed the House on a number of occasions that I plan to address this issue in a measured and rational way.  The Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance will continue to work towards a practical solution from a company law and tax perspective.  I propose to put forward this solution for comment from all concerned before the Government takes a decision.  That remains my position.  It may be necessary to change the criminal law as well.</P>
    <P>Since last week's Committee Stage, Deputy Rabbitte issued a press release in this regard. Deputy Rabbitte has a keen eye to the media, for which I commend him. He usually issues press releases on a Friday evening, and his press officer headlines them very well.  I want to deal with some of his comments in last weekend's foray.  There have been many comments regarding Revenue's implementation of section 58 both by the media and by certain Members.  We discussed this matter in committee.  It is not the case, as suggested by Deputy Rabbitte, and in some press reports, that Revenue have not implemented section 58 of the Finance Act, 1995.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in correspondence with Deputy Rabbitte, made it clear that Revenue have implemented the section as far as is practicable. Because it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to know the resident status of a newly registered company incorporated within the Companies Office, and because it is likely that less desirable companies will not furnish the information automatically, as they are obliged to do, Revenue issues a formal notice to all newly registered companies requesting them to provide information.  This means that all companies, resident or non-resident, are asked to provide information as soon as possible and are notified of their incorporation by the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>Where a company indicates that it is not resident in the State and will not have an Irish sourced income and provides the information required under section 58, then it is designated as a non-resident company which does not have liability to Irish tax.  Where a company replies that it is non-resident but does not provide the information required under section 58, it is advised it has not fulfilled its obligation under the section and should do so.  Where a non-resident company does not respond to a notice requiring information, the only way in which the matter could be pursued is by issuing reminders to all the companies on the Companies register who have not provided the information.  This is because it is not possible to identify which of those companies is non-resident.  Clearly that position is not satisfactory.  The issue is complicated by the fact that the companies on the register which are non-resident have no obligation to furnish information until such time as they commence to carry on a trade or business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> I informed this House recently that since the 1995 legislation was enacted, 2,622 companies identified themselves as non-resident.  Deputy Rabbitte related this to the speculative figure of 40,000 companies and, on this basis, issued a press release indicating the low effectiveness rate of section 58.  The truth is that we do not know how many IRNR companies there are, and there is no way of knowing that because it is not possible to determine the resident status of a company from the details supplied by the Companies Registration Office.  Deputy Rabbitte understood what I said, but the press release does not indicate an understanding of the matter.  That is the reason I dealt with the figure of 40,000 which is the denominator for arriving at this percentage &mdash; we are not too sure where that figure came from.</P>
    <P>The question is also raised as to why we are now being told that section 58 is not effective. Deputy Ruairí Quinn, as Minister, was aware of the foreign direct investment aspect and the need not to adversely affect that aspect in any solution which might be brought forward.  It was recognised that the information requirement proposed by the amendment brought forward in 1995 by Deputy Quinn was an interim measure pending agreement on other solutions, and there would be difficulties in making it fully effective.  The main purpose of section 58 was to dissuade undesirable companies from incorporating in Ireland in the first place, to stop the marketing of such companies on the basis that there were no disclosure requirements for Irish registered companies, which was the situation until then.  Clearly his concern about making it fully effective was well founded.  The measure had no teeth in that there was no effective way of dealing with those companies who failed to comply with the information requirements of the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also referred to the background to section 58, and I have dealt with that matter.  Deputy Quinn was quite well aware, in bringing forward section 58, what its intention was.  It was a dissuading measure.  In his correspondence later that year with Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce and Technology at the time, he pointed out clearly that he also wanted the other measures put on the table.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derek McDowell raised the possibility of handling this by a pre-incorporation process. This matter is being considered by the interdepartmental working group.  It has been with the group since 1995 and everybody is trying to find a solution.  If it were easy, it would have been solved a long time ago.  The difficulty of doing anything on the pre-incorporation side is how one would go about it.  Anybody can form a company, and it is not specified whether it is to be a non-resident company.  What happens afterwards determines that.  For tax purposes the definition of a non-resident company is where it is controlled and managed.  If it is controlled and managed outside the State it is non-resident for tax <Col N="936" /> purposes.  However, when the company is bought off the shelf with ordinary subscriber shares, usually in the name of the secretary or the typist in the formation agent's office, the shares are subsequently transferred, and there is no way of knowing who then owns them.  I do not know how having a pre-incorporation process would solve that angle.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's blunt instrument for dealing with this &mdash; the Deputy recognises that his amendment is very broad &mdash; would cause difficulties because of the tax status of certain companies here.  This is quite a complex problem to which I hope we will have a number of solutions later this year.  I hope the comprehensive reply I have given at least elucidates some of the problems and in particular gives some background to the figure of 40,000.  There is no basis for saying there are 40,000 companies, but when an idea gets into the Irish mind there is great difficulty in getting it out. It is now believed that there are 40,000 companies. I can honestly say that I do not know whether it is 40,000 or 400, and neither does anybody else.</P>

      <P>I wonder why we do not know. I understand that when a company is incorporated it is given an incorporation number so, presumably, we know how many companies there are.  I also understand that a company is required to file statements of account whether it is resident or non-resident here for tax purposes.  I appreciate that there is a compliance problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are required to file a statement of account with the Companies Office, unless I am mistakenly advised on that.  It seems that it would be a relatively simple procedure to require them to say in that statement of account whether they are resident here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Minister is making but it is still the case that they are required to file statements of account which are typically filed by accountants acting on their behalf, and they will typically have nominee directors here.  I accept it is difficult to pursue these companies if they do not file statements of <Col N="937" /> account, but a number of them do.  They employ accountants and solicitors to do that on their behalf.  I suspect, however, those statements of account do not require them to specify if they are tax resident.  It would be relatively simple to require companies which file statements of account to specify if they are tax resident.  It should be presumed that a company is tax resident until such time as it is established it is non-resident for tax purposes.  I would not be so presumptuous as to tell the Minister how that approach might work, but it would bring matters out into the open and give us information about these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably more suitable to a Committee Stage debate.  While I accept the validity of the Deputy's approach, it is difficult to know how it would work.  Non-resident companies can operate anywhere on the globe.  They merely use the name of the company to claim they are registered in Ireland.  We do not know the tax or company laws that apply in the states in which they operate.  The Companies Registration Office or the Revenue Commissioners will probably never hear from them again.  They may write to people who do not exist.  The only information they will have about such companies is their names.</P>
      <P>Ninety-nine per cent of companies that file their accounts operate legitimately.  If a company does not file its accounts it is struck off the books under normal company law procedures.  Deputy Rabbitte will be able to elucidate further on that matter, I am merely speaking from my professional background.  However, the damage will be done if they are not struck off for three years. The company will have been formed and the impression given abroad will be that it is Irish. When a company is formed, it is given a company seal and a memorandum and articles of association. A company may register here but operate in another country and the Irish authorities or the</P>
      <P>Revenue may never hear from it again.  It is up to the country in which it operates to work out the loss to its tax system, but we do not want the impression going abroad that such companies are Irish and are involved with, say, the IFSC.  That gives us a bad name.  We do not incur any tax loss because they do not operate within the State, but our reputation is being damaged.</P>
      <P>I am merely trying to point out the difficulties in enforcing Deputy McDowell's proposal.  I am not trying to be awkward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that because these companies are not trading here they are not required to make returns to the Revenue and, therefore, do not come to its attention.  Will the Minister confirm if they are obliged to return statements of account to the Companies Registration Office?  Perhaps that could be used as a means to strike them off the books.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's final point, companies would not have been struck off in the period in question because the necessary resources were not in place.  In fairness to the people working in the Companies Registration Office, it is important that we make that point. Deputy Coveney will confirm the discussions and exchanges of correspondence I had with him, as Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, about the new facilities for the Companies Registration Office.  The conditions under which the staff of that office were expected to exercise the discernment that Deputy McDowell claims would be reasonable were appalling.  They simply could not do the work involved because they did not have the necessary resources.  This is not a reflection on the calibre of the personnel in that office.  That position is changing and consequently the list can be kept somewhat more up to date.</P>
      <P>We have teased out this matter further, but the Minister still refuses to make the Bill more effective by bringing forward a package of reforms in due course.  He is wrong in stating the Tánaiste put the two letters on the record of the House.  It is the oldest trick in the book.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>She put a sentence on the record of the House calculated to support her point of view.  Accusing the Tánaiste of concealing information is like accusing Mother Teresa of raiding the piggybank.  The Tánaiste used one sentence from the two letters to support her point of view, but the two letters support the Minister's point of view that this is an extremely complex issue.  The letters reveal it is a complex issue.</P>
      <P>In a letter I received from the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, he stated that the subject matter of his letter was about the misuse by a proportion of Irish registered non-resident companies.  I do not know if the Minister knew what a proportion meant, but I certainly did not.  I suggest he did not, because three years' later the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, still does not know.  I did not know the seriousness of this matter.  My Department did not represent to me the gravity of the matter.  It was never a legislative priority in a very heavy legislative schedule with which I dealt. However, it was represented to me that it was a complex issue.  In reply to the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, I set out six questions, some of which were touched on here and others which were not.  The main thrust of the letter touches on the main point raised by Deputy McDowell. In that letter I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the Companies Registration Office is continuing to examine what, if any, procedural changes could <Col N="939" /> be instituted there that might be of help.  The indications so far are that due to resource and other constraints, very little would be possible and even if it were, it would be of a minor nature. However, I will update you on any developments which occur.  I can't really see what other interim administrative measures are possible within my Department.</P>
    <P>That was the temper of the time which was formed by the complexity of the issue and the impact changes, such as those suggested by the Department of Finance, might have on legitimate international companies located and creating jobs here.  In a letter to the then Minister for Finance I suggested that he should request a report from the Revenue Commissioners on the practical application of the changes made in the 1995 Act with an estimate in relation to compliance with requests for specific information.  I also suggested that the Revenue Commissioners should be requested to submit monthly figures on IRNR set-ups in the current year as well as the corresponding overall figure to provide for comparison and to ascertain if there had been any detectable slackening in the rate of IRNR set-ups.  I asked for indications from the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners as to any possible loopholes in the recent measure and how they might be rectified and any other ideas the officials might have on making the measure more effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to a press release I issued.  I withdraw any imputation, which I never intended, against the Revenue Commissioners on the question of applying the 1995 Act.  If that is a bone of contention between us I withdraw it.  The point is that it is entirely ineffectual.</P>
    <P>When the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners replies to me and states the section is being implemented &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;, that means he is sending out notices to non-resident companies and &mdash; for the reasons outlined by the Minister &mdash; they are not replying.  We are still in <Col N="940" /> a situation where we do not know the extent of the problem.  One cannot deal with the phenomenon of sending out notices to people who do not want to reply by asking the Companies Registration Office to strike them off.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to make somebody accountable in this jurisdiction.  It would be a step in the direction of compliance and implementation if we were to make a company formation agent responsible, accountable and open to being fined for failure to comply.  A small number of people are specialising in setting up these companies for fly by night operators who are coming in here and we should focus on them. I accept the Minister's point that if this is done outside the jurisdiction we have a problem in regard to pursuit.  However, let us deal with it in this jurisdiction.  I am sure the Minister's officials have gone through this file in great detail.  There were a number of other questions in that letter of 20 November.  If I ever got a reply to that letter I have not seen it but I would be curious to know the view at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks he can bring forward a package of comprehensive proposals that will shut out this phenomenon.  The measure introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, is very well pitched to deal with this phenomenon in a manner which does not impact on legitimate international companies here.  All it requires to make it effective is to put the responsibility on an individual in this jurisdiction to report, as required, and if guilty of non-compliance he is fined.  If that can be done under this Finance Bill, it would greatly advance matters rather than saying the 1995 Act is purely for dissuasion, to send out a signal.  There is no point in sending out a signal to these people as they would not pay the slightest attention to it.  They were turfed out of Britain and were accommodated in this jurisdiction. We did not pick it up for some time.  The sentiments of this amendment, if taken on board, would greatly constrain their freedom to move.</P>

The expenditure on conversion of the building into a nursing home would, however, qualify for capital allowances under section 22 of the Bill.

      <P>I wish to change the structure of the allowances.  I am advised by the people who have the vessels involved that it is not attractive to the financial institutions to support the measure as it is structured.  It is front loaded at the rate of 50 per cent in the first year, 7.5 per cent from the second to the seventh year and 5 per cent in the eighth year.  The Minister's proposal is attractive from the point of view of the rate of accelerated benefit in the first year. However, I am advised that the steep fall off in the second to seventh years is so blunt as to make the measure unattractive to the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>If the relief was constrained into a five year period the 50 per cent in the first year could be maintained, 15 per cent could be allowed in the second to fourth years and 5 per cent in the last year.  The industry has indicated to me that if the eight year period is let stand there will be a low take up of the measure because it is not an attractive proposition.  Rebalancing the reliefs, maintaining the front loaded accelerated rate of 50 per cent in the first year, allowing 15 per cent in the following three years and 5 per cent in the final year is necessary for the measure to be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a new method of granting capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on sea fishing boats in the white fish fleet.  The measures for fishing boats introduced in section 23 of the Bill operate on the basis of an enhanced first year allowance of 50 per cent of qualifying expenditure, with the balance being written off over a seven year period.  This is designed to meet requests for a front loading of the allowances to enable the benefits of the scheme to be enjoyed early after the expenditure has been incurred.</P>
      <P>The amendment would appear to have the effect of allowing relief to be claimed in respect of the full amount of the expenditure over a five year writing down period as opposed to eight years as proposed in the Bill.  The arrangements for capital allowances for fishing boats being introduced in the Bill are intended to grant relief in a manner beneficial to fishermen by means of a special first year treatment, but also to retain as far as possible the integrity of the capital regime applied to this area generally.  Thus, the facility for claiming an enhanced element of the relief was restricted to the first year of claim in relation to the outlay of capital expenditure.  This in itself represented a departure from the position that has come about in recent years whereby accelerated capital allowances have, in general, been greatly curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of enhanced capital allowances is one element of a two-pronged approach aimed at aiding the white fish fleet.  Under a plan devised by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, £65 million is to be spent in the industry on upgrading existing vessels, building <Col N="945" /> new vessels and buying good second-hand vessels.  As well as the provision of tax relief, the plan envisages the combination of direct national and EU grant aid to encourage investment.  In the circumstances I consider that the enhanced capital allowances being provided for in the Bill are more than adequate to trigger investment in the whitefish fleet.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill was widely welcomed by the whitefish fleet.  Investment has been slow in that sector for a long period and the provisions I propose give incentives to people to invest in the sector.  There has been streamlining of the capital allowance structure in recent years.  As someone who has practised the art of accountancy and taxation advice I consider it most welcome. I would be loath to change the rules because there is a uniformity to the balancing of the allowances being written off.</P>
    <P>Under this section up to 50 per cent of the capital expenditure can be claimed in the first year and the remaining 50 per cent is written off over the next seven years in the same way as any capital allowance regime.  I am not prepared to make an exception in this regard.  The incentivisation under section 23 has been widely welcomed and I hope it will have the intended effect of regenerating the whitefish fleet.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he does not wish to tolerate exceptions and wishes to stick with the general format.  I differ with him on his impression that the whitefish fleet has welcomed this measure.  The Minister's constituency is landlocked, although he has told us about the canal, where a different type of fishing takes place. There are serious differences in the fishing industry in terms of the capacity of vessels which have the power to process fish and are effectively floating fish factories.  A great many vessels are not in that league.  If the Minister is under the impression that measure has received a uniform welcome, that is not the case.  The view I am advocating is that of the industry around the coast.  The net point being made is that the steep fall off after year one is such that it will not be attractive to the financial institutions.  This measure is particularly aimed at them in that vessel owners will ultimately benefit in the form of lower financing charges.  If the financial institutions do not respond to it, the vessel owners will not be able to avail of it.  The Minister said there would be no exception, but the fishing industry is an exception.  Some vessels around the coast are huge floating fish factories, but that does not account for the majority of those who <Col N="946" /> earn a living around the coast.  The view represented by the industry is that if the Minister were to change the write off period so that the fall off after year one is not as steep as envisaged in the measure, it would give a genuine boost to the industry, otherwise it will not.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  Even though the Minister does not hail from a maritime county, I am sure he is aware of the state of the whitefish fleet.  I had a short exposure to that ministry and was shocked by the conditions under which whitefish crews operate.  Apart from the boats being very old and relatively small, there is a genuine fear they are near the end of their useful life and are a danger in adverse weather conditions.  Anything successive Governments have done to date has failed to create the circumstances and conditions in which the whitefish fleet could be renewed.  If Deputy Rabbitte's information is correct, and I accept it is, the Minister's welcome proposals do not go far enough.  It would be regrettable not to take the extra step because some of the most serious accidents at sea in the past five or six years have occurred in whitefish boats largely due to the deteriorating state of that fleet because of a lack of investment.  Investment in that fleet is desperately needed.  If Deputy Rabbitte's information is that the present measures are not adequate to attract the necessary investment, I strongly support his amendment and ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  Compared to our EU counterparts, our whitefish fleet is obsolete.  We should not cod ourselves that we are operating on a level playing pitch with them.  The concessions are good, but the eight year period that applies to them is too long.  To achieve its intended effect, the section should be amended to shorten the time period to five years maintaining 50 per cent allowances in year one, the required contributions in a three year period and to substitute 30 per cent for 15 per cent in the fifth and final year.  That would be a step in the right direction.  If the Minister accepted this amendment he would copperfasten the success of our whitefish fleet which has been treated very shabbily in the past 30 years.  The majority of vessels in our whitefish fleet are 25 to 30 years old.  An injection of finance into our fishing industry is urgently required to revitalise it and to build our fleet up to the required standard necessary to compete with our European counterparts.  For that reason substituting the five years for eight years in page 46, line 22 and three years for six years in page 46, line 36 and 30 per cent for 15 per cent in page 46, line 37 is the necessary fillip required to give our fishing industry an opportunity to get its rightful share of the cake in terms of the fishing stakes in Europe.  The measure, as structured, is not sufficiently attractive to financial institutions at which it is mainly aimed.  It is designed to benefit vessel owners in <Col N="947" /> the form of lower financing charges.  We will not be able to attract the big money that needs to be injected into our fleet without the Minister agreeing to the changes set out in these amendments. I urge him not to let this opportunity pass without adding his name to the honoured list in the marine industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals which are part of the package introduced by the Minister, Deputy Woods to update our whitefish fleet.  The measure provides for a capital allowances write down period of 50 per cent in the first year, 15 per cent in respect of each of the next six years and 10 per cent in last year. Fishermen in my constituency are happy with these proposals.  If prospective borrowers can show they can repay a loan, banks will usually finance projects.  That is the position in regard to this measure.  The repayments will be made easier by the allowances that have been front-loaded.  It is outlandish to say the financial institutions are unhappy with this measure.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the lifespan of a whitefish boat?  Is it five years, seven years, ten, or 20 years?  Is it the case that something has to be written off quickly because a boat will deteriorate over five years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoy regular jousts inside and outside the House with Deputy Rabbitte and on most occasions he is well briefed and knows his subject.  However, I suggest he should consult his colleague Deputy Gilmore on this matter.  In spite of the fact that he comes from a part of Ireland which has a coastline, I suggest that, where this amendment is concerned, he is not talking through the proper part of his body.  The Deputy obviously does not understand the purpose of this section.  Although I acknowledge he is normally well briefed, this is not his area of expertise.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by the whitefish fleet, I introduced a capital allowance incentive scheme.  I recognised that, in view of the dilapidated condition of the fleet, as outlined by Deputies Coveney and Sheehan, something effective had to be done.  The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has been discussing a package of proposals in this area.  Drastic action needs to be taken as the fleet is in a very poor condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals were put to me, as they were to the previous Administration, to do something in the area of tax incentives.  I have effectively applied the capital allowances incentives, which operate in regard to urban and rural renewal schemes and so on, to investors in the whitefish fleet.  As I have limited many of the capital allowances tax breaks, this measure will be even more attractive than it would have been prior to the budget changes.  I introduced a tax incentive package in which capital allowances can be used to avail of tax breaks <Col N="948" /> and extended that principle to the whitefish fleet. That was the purpose of the section.</P>
    <P>The effect of the section is that in year one, an investor could write off 50 per cent of the cost of a vessel.  This is a major incentive already available in schemes which have existed for a number of years.  This measure will be very attractive to private investors as it is not just confined to financial institutions to use this section to limit their liability; it will also be open to private investors to invest their money in these projects in order to minimise their tax liability.  Even though I limited the application of capital allowance measures, I opened up other areas for legitimate reasons.  For example, I introduced a capital allowance package in regard to nursing homes along the same lines as that which applies to the whitefish fleet.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent of the cost of a fishing vessel can be written off against the tax liability of a passive investor or financial institution in year one.  That leaves a further 50 per cent to be written off over the rest of the period.  Capital allowances in various areas are written off in a standardised way over the course of seven years.  Plant and machinery is written off over six years at 15 per cent for years one to five and 10 per cent in the final year. The cost of industrial buildings is written off at 4 per cent per annum over 25 years.  Until a few years ago, there were a myriad of capital or writing down allowances in existence.  Those have been streamlined over the past decade.</P>
    <P>If, in year one, an individual investor avails of the 50 per cent capital allowances, the remaining 50 per cent must be written off over seven years at a rate of 7.5 per cent for years two to seven and 5 per cent in the last year.  The only difference involved in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would be to speed up the process.  The amendment would involve the 7.5 per cent under my proposal increasing to 12.5 per cent from years one to four under Deputy Rabbitte's proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would be 50 per cent in year one, 15 per cent for the next three years and 5 per cent in year five.  I might not understand fishing but I do understand arithmetic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  My proposal has been welcomed by the fishing industry and some sectors wish to make it even more attractive.  The big attraction, however, for individual investors is the 50 per cent capital allowance in year one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That change makes the capital allowance scheme even more attractive as this will be the only area in which that opt-out will be available.  It is hoped that this will encourage individual investors as well as financial institutions to invest in the fleet.  The major attraction is the 50 per cent capital allowance in year one and the balance over the years is not of great <Col N="949" /> issue.  Deputy Rabbitte's proposal would possibly make it a little more attractive but I would not be prepared to upset the streamlining of capital allowances to facilitate one particular area.  The concession I made in applying the capital allowance incentive scheme to the whitefish fleet should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Some of the vessels currently in use are 20 to 25 years old while the average lifespan of some of the newer vessels is approximately 15 years. The section is intended to encourage high income earners &mdash; possibly in other sectors of the fishing industry &mdash; to invest money in the whitefish fleet. Some of those involved in the pelagic fishing industry are making a lot of money so perhaps they could invest some of it with their brethren. Action should have been taken on the whitefish fleet a long time ago and this section is intended to facilitate such action now.  We should not get bogged down in the details of how the balance of the capital allowance could be written off.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister outline what extra cost would be incurred by his Department to reduce the number of years from eight to five? That would make it far more attractive for financial institutions to invest in the marine industry which was absolutely starved of financial backing for the past generation.  Why could the capital allowances not be streamlined into a five year, rather than an eight year, period?  More than 80 per cent of the white fishing fleet is over 30 years old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to calculate the cost of the changes to the whitefish fleet, because we do not know what the effect of this measure will be in encouraging more investment in the fleet or what the expenditure will be on the vessels which will come on stream.</P>
      <P>If I change the capital allowance structure of writing off the balance of costs over a different period, I will have to change it in many areas.  I am under pressure to do so, particularly from farmers who want capital expenditure on their buildings written off over a different period. There will be a considerable cost if I have to change the capital allowance writing down period to accommodate different sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Finance streamlined capital allowances and we now have a more rational system.  I practised in an era when there were 20 different rates of depreciation or writing down allowances, depending on the type of plant, machinery, office equipment, buildings etc.  It was a crazy system.  On a straight line basis of cost per year, a writing down allowance of 20 per cent was given in year one and it never reached zero.  It <Col N="950" /> was changed to a more rational system, to which I will stick.</P>
    <P>The whitefish fleet welcomed this section and nobody has made a case that this amendment will make any great difference.  I am not prepared to accept it because it will open up a front I do not wish to contemplate.</P>

      <P>I do not mind the Minister accusing me of not being an expert on the maritime industry, but that can hardly be said of Deputy Coveney and Deputy Sheehan.  One does not need to be an expert on the maritime industry to understand the net point at issue, which is the write down period.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this measure is welcomed by the whitefish fleet.  I did not suggest that it was not and the Minister misunderstood my amendment. I have not tampered with the year one accelerated rate of 50 per cent.  That is the big attraction.  However, I want to narrow the write down period from eight to five years.  This would retain 50 per cent in year one, 15 per cent for the intervening three years and five per cent in year five.  The Minister did not address my point. Deputy Sheehan argued that the whitefish fleet is suffering from old age.</P>

      <P>It needs to be replaced.  Private investors will not avail of this measure and therefore it is primarily aimed at financial institutions. The argument represented by the industry is that the eight year write down period as it stands is not sufficiently attractive to financial institutions. The Minister may find private investors to come up with the money for a big factory ship, but that is not what we are talking about here.  The Minister will be dependent on take-up by the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan said the Minister is spoiling a good idea by refusing to take on board the argument about the timespan of the write down. Whatever about having knowledge of the fishing industry, the net point is a relatively simple one. The Minister does not want to reopen the matter but the whitefish industry needs an injection.  The plant is old and in need of replacement.  This could be a worthwhile measure which comes down to the length of time of the write down.</P>

      <P>In page 49, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) in subsection (1), in the definition of &lsquo;qualifying trading operations' by the substitution of the following for paragraphs (a) and (b):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a) the manufacture of goods within the meaning of Part 14,</P>
      <P>(b) the rendering of services in the course of a service industry (within the meaning of the Industrial Development Act, 1986), or</P>
      <P>(c) the rendering of services in the course or futherance of a business of freight forwarding or the provision of logistical services in relation to such business where the rendering or provision of those services is carried on in an area or areas immediately adjacent to any of the airports to which section 340(2) refers.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, there was a discussion about adding a new set of qualifying activities under the ambit of the regional airport enterprise areas tax incentive scheme.  At the time I highlighted the situation regarding the State aids aspects of the scheme which were investigated thoroughly by the EU Commission and which was only recently approved by it, apart from the regional airport enterprise areas where approval had to be sought in the case of each airport enterprise zone when the qualifying project is submitted.</P>
      <P>However, in an endeavour to assist the airports I approached the Commission on an informal basis to ascertain whether freight forwarding and certain allied services would be acceptable to the Commission for inclusion in the scheme.  My officials have since been in contact with the Commission on an informal basis and sought an opinion on whether freight forwarding and certain allied services might be included in the regional airport enterprise areas scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The Commission has not objected outright to the proposal and has not objected to such services being included in the scheme as an allowable activity for tax incentive purposes, subject to Commission approval at a later date.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this new category of activities can be included in the Finance Bill, but subject to a later commencement order which in turn is dependent on Commission approval.  The amendments are designed to ensure that effect is given to this position.  However, there is no guarantee that projects in this category will subsequently be approved by the Commission which will make the final decision on the matter in the context of State aid rules.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: It is no exaggeration to say the announcement last year that tax designation had been granted to Knock Airport generated more excitement and enthusiasm than any other announcement in Mayo since the opening of the airport.  It was seen as the key to the development of the region.  The airport is 40 miles from Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Galway, Athlone and the capitals of the surrounding counties and is, therefore, in an ideal position to generate the kind of economic momentum the region requires but has not enjoyed.</P>
      <P>It is again no exaggeration to say that we were shocked to learn that 50 per cent of the anticipated business or economic activity would not come to fruition as a result of the exclusion of freight forwarding.  I commend Deputy Kenny for tabling an amendment to rectify this and the Minister for adopting an open and receptive attitude to it.  Freight forwarding is crucial to the survival of the airport and the economy of the region.</P>
      <P>I have one remaining reservation.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on 28 January in which I asked the number of projects which had applied for concessions under the scheme.  He said that freight forwarding was not included.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my previous replies to the House on the work of the National Centre for Partnership I outlined the aims and work programme of the centre.</P>
      <P>The joint directors of the centre have been actively implementing this work programme since their appointment in 1997.  The focus of the centre's work is, at present, on promotion of partnership. The approach taken has been to consult extensively with management and unions in both the private and public sectors to identify the level of partnership already in existence at workplace level, to encourage management and unions to adopt successful models of partnership practice and to spread and share information which will lead towards increased knowledge and a wider use of partnership.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the centre assisted in the publication of the Management, Science and Finance Union's guide on employee participation in the workplace and further involvement in relevant publications is envisaged.  In addition, in conjunction with the Irish Productivity Centre, the centre organised a conference which took place last Thursday, 5 March, on partnership in the public service.  I had the pleasure to address this conference and I am arranging for copies of my address to be circulated to the House.</P>
      <P>In addition, the centre intends to hold further conferences, seminars and workshops during the year and has also been active in addressing relevant conferences and seminars such as those recently organised by the Industrial Relations News and the Irish Management Institute.  The centre is also commencing active marketing of the partnership concept and approach in the private sector, initially targeted at senior management.</P>
      <P>The centre has commissioned research on partnership at workplace level.  Its findings, along with studies undertaken by IBEC, ICTU and the Labour Relations Commission, will be distilled into an information database which will allow for monitoring and benchmarking of progress.</P>
      <P>The centre is particularly conscious of the important role training and development can play in promoting partnership.  In conjunction with the Irish Productivity Centre and the centre for management and organisation development in the Department of Finance, the centre has been engaged in drafting partnership training and development modules for the Civil Service and these will be of benefit to the wider public service as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that training materials will be completed within the next two months.  Also, the <Col N="956" /> centre will be actively involved in assisting the ADAPT programme, which is the EU assisted joint IBEC and ICTU programme to develop partnership between management and unions in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The centre has a very important role to play in facilitating and developing partnership.  I am particularly happy with its progress to date and it will continue to have my support and encouragement in its endeavours to foster partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the consideration of the National Centre for Partnership included any reflection on the recent events at Ryanair?</P>
      <P>In so far as the centre's work programme sets out to implement and deepen Partnership 2000, has there been any consideration of including the matters raised by the unemployed in the preparation for Partnership 2000?  I am referring to the kind of agenda CORI has outlined at its conference. Does that figure within the centre's work programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first question, I am sure the partnership board and its liaison group, which covers all the social partners in the widest sense, will be involved in any industrial relations matters.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second question, the work programme at this stage is certainly inclusive. However, the centre is working on the models of people at work.  It is trying to develop the best practice.  It is drawing from its own experience, knowledge, database and best practices operated in many companies, both in the public and private sectors.  The centre hopes to make those best practices models for success in the development of partnership arrangements not just at national level but at workplace level also.</P>
      <P>Whatever happens in future, the social partners believe that at national level the model has been very successful.  It is important for it to filter down to local level and that the good concepts that exist in some companies are widely practised.  That is something I would like to see as it avoids difficulties and unnecessary disputes.  Many practices exist, both in multinationals and small indigenous companies, that could be successfully implemented with the help of the National Centre for Partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as supportive as the Taoiseach of best practice in management and of having a joint approach between partners in the workplace.  The National Centre for Partnership was quite clearly established on the basis of addressing the full social agenda.  In other words, it, like other mechanisms that were suggested, purported to narrow the gap between those at work who are benefiting from the increased productivity of the economy and those seeking to leave the ranks of the unemployed through training mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be a serious imbalance if the first phase of the work was reported but did not <Col N="957" /> appear to address the issue of those who are outside the circle of IBEC, Congress and those at work?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum is involved in many of the things the Deputy mentioned.  In its formulation the partnership itself was dealing with those in work. Its own terms of reference &mdash; and those of the organisations of which it is made up &mdash; try to build the relationship with people in employment. That is what they are focused on but that is not to say that the best practices will not indirectly help the unemployed.  They are, however, centred on helping people in work.</P>
      <P>IBEC, ICTU, the Labour Relations Commission, the National Productivity Centre, the UCD centre for Business Research, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Department of Finance are all working together in a consultative role to achieve that. Their aim is not to deal with those outside the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be somewhat dangerous if a dual approach emerged in which the National Centre for Partnership ceased to be a national centre addressing a national issue and became instead the centre for partnership and productivity in the workplace, while on the other side the NESF was dealing with all the categories I mentioned?  Would there be significant merit in seeking to integrate the work programmes of both bodies to not give the impression that one senior body created out of social consensus and consultation dealt with those who were drawing benefit from the workplace while another group dealt with the agenda of those who did not?  The difficulty is that one would be regarded as the hard mechanism of consultation and the other the soft mechanism carrying the social agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In time there may be some merit in that but the remit of the National Centre for Partnership, under Partnership 2000, deals with work related issues.  It will endeavour to take the best practice operating in various workforces and managements and introduce that to other people in the workplace.  That remit was given to the centre by everyone involved in social partnership. That is not to say that some of the centre's work and the work done by the liaison group will not be of direct benefit.  The main focus of the centre is to help work related issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the major problems in industry is that employers do not invest enough in the training and education of their own employees?  Will he agree further that one of the reasons employers do not do this is that they are afraid the employee will move on to another employer carrying with him or her all the benefits of any investment the employer might have made in the first instance thereby losing the benefit to the original firm <Col N="958" /> which paid for the training and education?  Has the National Centre for Partnership given any thought to the problem as to how training contracts might be drawn up between employers and employees to ensure there would be a reciprocal relationship between employer and employee on the basis of which much more substantial investment in training and education by employers might take place, particularly in light of the finding of the OECD study on literacy which showed that many employees in Ireland are losing literacy skills during their working life simply by lack of use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The liaison group of the National Centre for Partnership is conscious that there should be resources for the acquisition and dissemination of information and expertise on partnership and training for people in the workplace. Deputy Bruton is correct in that many companies in the private sector do not put sufficient resources into training on the factory floor, in the office, the environment or at management level.  A decade ago the Galvin report, which was the last substantive study carried out in this area, indicated that Irish management spent more money on newspapers than on management training.  That has changed substantially in many sectors but the various EU and OECD reports, as well as studies carried out by Irish universities, indicate that management training and training of the workforce always benefits the enterprise. People should not fear spending resources on management training or training of any kind because it is an additional benefit.  It is true that once people receive more training and expertise they move on, but I do not accept that is a valid reason for enterprises not training their employees.  That would be a short-sighted approach.  In recent times more attention has been given to this area and I commend organisations such as the Irish Productivity Centre and others which are convincing workers to undertake more training.  We should do that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, however much he might deplore it, that the employer's fear of employees being poached by competitors is real?  To ignore that and pretend that employers, simply by being preached at, will spend more on training regardless of that fear, is to bury one's head in the sand.  Accepting reality rather than ideals, will the Taoiseach agree that the National Centre for Partnership should examine how a contract could be entered into between employers and employees which would make it attractive for more conservative employers to invest in training?  Will he not agree that the national centre should be asked to do something about this as distinct from simply giving sermons about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The partnership centre will display the success of best practice operated in model firms where money is being spent on training <Col N="959" /> and management.  I am not aware that a large number of firms have their heads in the sand on this issue and do not realise the benefit of training. The existing training organisations operate because companies are making investments.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, individual unions and management organisations are now spending money on training, which is welcome.  I agree the National Centre for Partnership should continue its endeavours to convince people to spend more on training.  We must not be naive about this. People will try to poach good employees from the organisations that spend the most on management training.  Denying employees access to good management training will not keep them in the workforce.  I would argue that the opposite is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the weakness of social partnership is the failure to translate what is happening at national level to the workplace?  Will he agree also that considerable progress has been made at national level but that is replicated in too few places in the workplace? Is the centre focusing on that point, and does it intend to publish occasional reports on different aspects of this phenomenon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The two people fronting the partnership company have many years of experience.  One is a senior person from ICTU and the other is from IBEC.  They will endeavour to take the best practice from their respective organisations and develop models that transcend the various sectors in Irish business.  There are excellent industrial relations and training models, as well as staff related organisations, and through seminars, publications, conferences and road shows they will encourage people to actively participate in training locally through the various organisations. With the co-operation of the Irish Productivity Centre, the Labour Relations Commission and others I believe the centre, which is only in existence a year, will make a great deal of progress in the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there would be a serious danger to the concept of social partnership if workers in their place of work regard it as merely a mechanism to control wages?  If companies benefiting from the business environment created by social partnership do not implement the concept in the workplace, there is a risk to the concept.  How would the Taoiseach enforce the approach he has outlined in the case of, for example, the dispute to which Deputy Higgins referred?  That is a repudiation of the concept of social partnership.  It is bad faith by the <Col N="960" /> Ryanair employer.  It is a repudiation of the environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that it is a demonstration of bad faith on the part of Ryanair?  Is it the case that Ryanair has grown and profited in an environment created by social partnership and is it repudiating the notion of social partnership? How does the Taoiseach view intrusion of the concepts he has advocated, with which I agree, in such a hostile environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any individual case the National Partnership Centre must take account of bad experiences.  There are always bad experiences.  In some cases people will not go to third parties.  Sometimes management is involved and other times, trade unions.  At present there are examples of both, although in most cases the focus is on one.  For different reasons people take different sides.  I hope the centre uses whatever mechanisms it develops to convince management and unions of best models.  Deputy Rabbitte is right that if a workforce believes it is working only in the interests of profit and that there are no beneficial effects for them, there will be disillusionment and resentment and ultimately partnerships and national agreements break down.</P>
      <P>It concerns me that some companies that have gained most from the ten or 11 years of national partnership, high economic growth, low interest rates and excellent export markets, believe they achieved those things on their own.  It is a matter of irritation to me when I am lectured by people who believe that those achievements resulted from the free market rather than from sacrifice, consensus and so on.  Some people in senior management believe that they have been responsible for the achievements of the past ten years, but that is not the case.  They have been made because people from all sectors worked together and contributed to bringing them about.</P>
      <P>Many of the benefits that have accrued over the years &mdash; the 1987-90 period saw the start of those benefits &mdash; have been as a result of the sacrifice of workers.  Most managers and people involved in partnership, however, realise the benefits of sharing their achievements.  In terms of the benefit of national partnership, Deputy Rabbitte will be aware of how innovative companies have become in rewarding their workforce for their success.  Rather than adopt a centralist attitude, it is important the achievements are shared.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I had only started my question.  I am usually quite succinct in my questions and I will be on this occasion.  Is the Taoiseach aware that for hundreds of thousands of workers talk of partnership is hollow rhetoric? Given the 1913 mentality of Ryanair, the opposition by most employers to a £5 per hour minimum wage and the huge disparity between increased profits and wage increases in the past ten years, as far as employers are concerned what is needed is not a centre for partnership but a partnership kindergarten where the basics will be learned.  Is it the case that a glorified wage restraint agreement has benefited employers to the detriment of the workers &mdash; for example, Waterford Crystal's massive profits, announced today, at a huge sacrifice to the workers?  What is the Taoiseach's comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the 1913 analogy would have applied to last weekend's dispute. As I spent the weekend, particularly Sunday, in my office working on the dispute it struck me as strange that half the travelling public were in a hurry to change their tickets from one airline to the airline at the centre of the dispute.  That would not have happened in 1913.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position now is different from that in 1913.  The Deputy mentioned Waterford Crystal.  That is a good example of a company that experienced market difficulties some years ago and sought to reduce its workforce in a strong remunerative way, which I condemned because I believed an excessive amount was paid to close down jobs.  The company, however, put vast amounts of money into training people and those workers who used traditional methods now have the most sophisticated technological ways of working.  It is unfair, therefore, to accuse companies such as that.</P>
      <P>The National Partnership Board should take examples of good practices at Waterford Crystal and other companies to convince others that this is the way to move into the 21st century.  The days of telling people how to work are gone; that is not an effective mechanism.  People in partnership must work on best practice and build models to ensure the company is successful.  The diktat no longer works.</P>

      <P>One of the lessons I learned in the past three years of politics is how long it takes to implement something from the time it is conceived or agreed.  Is the Minister aware this is an important initiative and, nine months into his ministry, we still do not know how this fund is to be accessed?  Can he be more specific about when these guidelines will be promulgated?  Does he envisage that the moneys will be applied for through the local drugs task forces?  If that is the case, how will one access the element of the fund <Col N="963" /> which is outside of the areas covered by the local drugs task forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am working extremely hard on drawing up the guidelines and I expect to have them finalised for the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion in March.  I want to retain my options on finalising the guidelines until such time as I have completed all of the work on them, but they will be brought before the Cabinet subcommittee for a decision in March and then before the Government for a final decision.</P>
      <P>In so far as access to the funds is concerned, that will be covered by the guidelines.  As the Deputy recognises, there are two separate issues here: first, the commitment that at least £20 million will be targeted at the local drugs task force areas; and second, the additional £10 million which is available to areas outside of the areas covered by the local drugs task forces but which also have difficulties with regard to drug misuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there seems to be a marked lack of urgency on the part of this Government about the heroin problem in Dublin in sharp contrast to the hue and cry created by the same people before the last general election?  It is nine months since the outcome of that election.  For the Government, at least, it is as if the drugs problem has gone away.  Not a penny of this youth services fund has been allocated, let alone spent in all that time.  We have not even received the criteria on which it will be based.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept that the heroin problem is resurfacing in some of the areas from which the communities had driven it out?  In streets just off O'Connell St, Dublin, heroin is being sold openly again.  Young people are falling victim to heroin daily and they will continue to fall victim to it until the Government implements the measures outlined in the reports of the last Government.  What Minister and Department will be responsible for allocating the £20 million fund specifically to the heroin ravaged areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute the assertion by the Deputy that there is any tardiness on the part of this Government in tackling the issue of heroin abuse. I am engaged practically full-time on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should take account of the excellent work being done by the 13 local drugs task forces which are now implementing at local and community level the programmes and services which were approved by this and the last Administration. That represents exceptional progress by the local drugs task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated that the guidelines for the young people's facilities and services fund will be available this month.  I also indicated when we discussed this issue that the £20 million fund will make a significant contribution to tackling the heroin abuse problem, to which the Deputy <Col N="964" /> referred, in areas covered by the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>So far as accessing the funds is concerned, the funds are currently in the Vote of the Department of Education and Science but the allocation of those funds, which will be based on the guidelines which I shall publish once they are approved by Government, will be through the National Drugs Strategy Team.  The team will without delay evaluate projects sent by the local drugs task forces so that the funds can be accessed.  The allocations will be made on the recommendations of the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion, which is where the control of the funds will rest.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is touching on the pilot projects I have initiated and which the Government has accepted.  The Government has given me authority and resources with which to proceed on four pilot projects, one of which covers the area to which the Deputy referred.  The other three are in the north inner city, Togher in Cork and Jobstown in Tallaght.  The purpose of that project is to determine the best mechanism for delivering all services to those areas on a co-ordinated basis to make a significant difference to the lives of the people residing there and to identify the gaps in service delivery to those areas.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that we will have an initial action plan available in September or October of this year for submission for approval to the Government.  If those pilot programmes work, they will make a significant difference to the lives of the people living in areas of most disadvantage. This is in keeping with the Taoiseach's desire to tackle areas of high disadvantage because of the extent of social exclusion in the areas concerned. The area to which the Deputy referred is one of the four pilot project areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern among youth service organisations at the long delay of nine months to which Deputy Rabbitte referred?  Is he aware of the view among the youth services that there was a tug of war between the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which is the Minister, Deputy Flood's, area, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea's, area which took a fair amount of time to sort out?</P>
      <P>What success has the Minister had in attracting private sector funding to complement the moneys being put up by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy there is no tug of war with regard to this funding.  The Deputy will understand that when I took office there was <Col N="965" /> a commitment that £20 million ought to be provided for a youth services and amenities fund, but there was no money on the table and it was up to this Government to provide it.  In an announcement in January the Taoiseach indicated there would be not £20 million but £30 million available over the next three years to back this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy did not listen to my earlier comments.  Perhaps he was not in the House to listen to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I indicated frequently that there was a tremendous amount of work to be done by the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion before we could make progress on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's announcement in January that £30 million would be available kept faith with the work of the Cabinet subcommittee and the House is now hearing of the outline of important plans to tackle social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no tug of war between Ministers, junior Ministers or between other organisations.  I outlined earlier how the funds are to be accessed and disbursed. As I advised the House on the last occasion when we discussed this issue, we have had contact from the corporate sector and I am very encouraged by that contact.  We are involved in discussions with the Irish Youth Foundation regarding how that funding might be accessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone welcomes the allocation of the £20 million and £10 million. However, those involved in providing the services want to know when they may anticipate access to the scheme being advertised.  In making their plans and dealing with people who desperately need these services and towards whom they are directed, they have inquired if it will impact on their work programmes for the current year.  Will any of the money become available in the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do I take it that the guidelines and the report on the pilot projects will not involve a further delay?  For example, if one was to wait for the report on the pilot projects to be succeeded by the guidelines approval and then the guidelines advertisement, one might envisage a situation where there would be no allocation in 1998.  Will the Minister of State provide an indication of when those who desperately need funding can anticipate the appearance of an advertisement in the newspapers, in respect of which they can <Col N="966" /> apply, and the drawing down of moneys to spend on this urgent problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately £7.5 million of the £30 million will be made available this year. Everyone is anxious that this should be utilised as quickly as possible.  Consequently, when the guidelines, which I intend to approve during March, are approved by the Government &mdash; I expect there will be no delay in that regard &mdash; we can begin to receive requests and make funding available to groups and organisations which wish to access it.  I assure the Deputy there will be no delay.</P>
      <P>In so far as the pilot projects are concerned, this is a separate but parallel development aimed at tackling social exclusion in areas of most disadvantage. If it is successful it will make a significant contribution to improving the lives, in a holistic and general way, of people living in areas currently suffering great levels of disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the deep level of frustration among organisers of football teams in the inner city?  I met a delegation from Markievicz Celtic, a football team from my area, whose players are obliged to change in what is effectively a hovel.  They have access to one shower which only has cold water. Does the Minister of State agree that this situation is unsatisfactory?  These football teams perform an enormous social function or service because they ensure that children who are vulnerable are kept off the streets.  We need to invest in such teams.  Is the Minister of State aware of the fear among my constituents in the City Quay, Ringsend and Irishtown areas that they will not obtain this money because they are situated in the docklands area and are seen to be benefiting already?  Will he confirm that they will obtain the money to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the difficulties the club or clubs in question have encountered in finding resources to carry out their work. This is an important issue and everyone recognises that there are many outstanding groups, clubs and organisations which provide services, facilities and leisure activities for young people. The leaders of those groups spend the greater part of their time fundraising, often in difficult circumstances.  Through this fund we will be able to reach out to those organisations and assist them with the type of funding they have not been able to access from the statutory sector in the past.  I recognise the point made by the Deputy and I believe we will be able to deal with it. Interested parties in any of the 13 areas covered by a local drugs task force will be entitled to access this funding and will not excluded because their area is situated near a development or emergent development of any kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): In view of the few times the Cabinet subcommittee has met, is the <Col N="967" /> Government really aware of the urgent need to distribute funds at the coalface?  Does the Government appreciate the resources spent now on youth services and facilities will stop additional numbers of young people falling victim to heroin and prevent immense suffering and the incurring of further costs on the part of the State? With regard to the criteria for qualification for funding, will the Minister of State provide assurances that these criteria will be wide and that projects for young people living in hard hit working class areas can be facilitated?  In respect of facilities for young people, including sports, football and horse lovers clubs and community centres in areas where there are high levels of poverty and, therefore, risk, will he provide assurances that such projects will come under the criteria he is in the process of drawing up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the projects to which the Deputy referred will come within the criteria outlined in the final guidelines when they emerge.  Organisations promoting activities in communities situated in a drugs task force area where young people are engaged or ought to be engaged in leisure, recreational and other activities of a positive nature will be able to benefit from the funding available to the areas in question. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made, within the different schemes being put in place, to discourage young people from becoming involved in the misuse of drugs in the first instance.  The efforts of the local drugs task forces, which have proven successful to date, are proceeding in a positive way in the communities in which they are located.</P>
      <P>I have met a number of voluntary and community organisations which are extremely positive regarding the issues being tackled at local level.  Yesterday I met representatives of COCAD who gave me a positive response to action being taken at present.  That was the second occasion on which I met representatives of that organisation and I have met others also. There is a recognition that co-ordination in respect of tackling drug misuse at community level is gradually beginning to succeed.  That is not to say that I do not fully accept we have a long and difficult road to follow.  However, with the resources being put in place and the other initiatives I am spearheading, I am confident that we will make a difference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> In the near future we will encounter serious problems because there will not be adequate numbers of young people to take up employment in these industries.  Has the Minister of State made approaches to large multinational companies which will benefit from the development of services in these areas?  What companies, if any, has he approached in this regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of approaches have been made but, at this early stage while discussions with the Irish Youth Foundation remain ongoing, I do not want to name any companies.  However, in due course the identities of these companies will become widely known.  I am encouraged by two-way contacts we have received in respect of corporate funding.  Following the outcome of our discussions with the Irish Youth Foundation, we will be in a position to make significant progress in a co-ordinated way.  Subscribers to the fund have different requirements and we must ensure that we are in a position to meet those requirements, within a particular set of guidelines, and obtain any corporate sector funding which might come our way.  We will actively pursue such funding.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister of State consulted the chairpersons of the local drugs task forces in terms of formulating the guidelines?  Am I incorrect in assuming that we have beaten off the Department of Education and Science and have avoided the moneys being sucked into the maw of that Department, and that the Minister will be the person putting recommendations to the Cabinet subcommittee in terms of the disbursal and accessing of these moneys?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>

Much of the work in terms of evaluation and processing of the applications will have been supervised by the National Drugs Strategy team or by an evaluation team attached to it.  There is no question of there being any difficulty in regard to that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I have asked for a meeting which I understand is to take place next week at which we will be discussing that issue.  It has already been brought to the attention of the Cabinet subcommittee by the National Drugs Strategy team.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his encouraging remarks.  I hope they are meant well. As I said in my answer to the question, I very much agree with the remarks by the Minister of State in Westport on 6 February.  We talk about the rights of Irish speakers.  Surely everyone in this House understands and must ensure that those rights are given full expression.  In order to do that we have to look at our own public bodies to ensure that the delivery of State services through Irish to Irish speakers both inside and outside the Gaeltacht is satisfactory.  Unfortunately, it is not as satisfactory as it should be. That has been recognised by the Minister of State and that is precisely why he made the statement he did in Westport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look at why the situation is as it is. To date we have not had legislation to deal with this matter.  There has certainly been goodwill on all sides of the House towards encouraging the delivery of State services through Irish.  Unfortunately, this has not happened in every sphere as we would have liked.  There has been a gradual improvement, and that has to be recognised. However, the voluntary guidelines that were drawn up have not proved as successful as they should have been.  That is why the Minister of State has already put forward the intention not only of our Department but of the Government to bring in a language Bill to deal with these situations. <Col N="970" /> Legislation itself will not be the answer to everything but we certainly hope it will give the general outlines that are needed to enable individuals to do business with the State through Irish if they wish to do so, whether or not they live in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general human rights approach, I look on this as a right in every sense of the word.  In the 1970s in the context of women's rights, especially in the area of equal pay, it was recognised that women's rights should not only be fought for but given expression in law.  That is what we are trying to do with regard to the delivery of State services through Irish.  We should begin there, and that is the intention of the Government.</P>

Más rud é gur é do mheas mar Aire Rialtais gur easpa cearta daonna é nach bhfuil na seirbhísí ar fáil tré Ghaeilge ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus acu siúd a labhrann Gaeilge, ba cheart go dtiocfadh an tiar Uachtarán Máire Mhic R6ibín isteach anseo.

      <P>I have already addressed that point.  I certainly attempted to do so in my last answer.  When the Minister of State was making his remarks on 6 February he referred to the denial of human rights if a native Irish speaker was not able to do his or her business through Irish when dealing with the State.  Surely that service should be there.  We are talking first and foremost about the delivery of State services to people who live in the Gaeltacht or to people who have Irish but who live outside the Gaeltacht. That was the reference the Minister of State made, if the Deputy opposite would care to read his statement in more detail.</P>

That is why there was reference to an ombudsman.  It has not yet been decided whether there should be an ombudsman to deal with issues through Irish. That is something that can be discussed at a later stage.  The Minister of State was outlining the general issues that need immediate attention and that he, I and the Government wished to see addressed through legislation.</P>

      <P>Decisions in relation to the further extension of section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, &lsquo;formerly section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended&rsquo;, beyond 1999 will be taken in the context of decisions relating to the 1999 budget.</P>
      <P>In view of the need for strategic decisions to be taken later this year, I am establishing an industry think tank to conduct an objective evaluation of existing schemes and incentives which will be fully informed by the views and depth of experience of our industry professionals and to formulate a strategic plan for the future of the film industry for my consideration.</P>
      <P>I have stated publicly that I believe that a longer term strategy is now required, and that we need to look to a timescale of from five to ten years, and this will be reflected in the terms of reference of the think tank.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of restoring the level of tax relief from 80 per cent to 100 per cent, the decision to reduce the level of tax relief to 80 per cent was taken by a Government of which Deputy Higgins was a member, following an extensive review of the film relief by an independent consultant.  That decision was based on the recommendations made in the INDECON report.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which will clearly fall to be considered by the think tank and I look forward to receiving its views in due course.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply.  I accept I was a member of the Government which commissioned the INDECON report, on foot of which the relief was negotiated for a period of three years.  She is also correct in stating that on the basis of an INDECON proposal the relief was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent.  However, I am equally correct in stating that during that time she unequivocally stated in the House that she favoured the relief being at 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> The Minister stated that the think tank will examine the needs of the industry for the next five to ten years.  IBEC has already put into print its recommendation that the 80 per cent rate should be increased to 100 per cent and that the period of time should be extended beyond three years.  It suggested that it should be coterminous with other related types of relief.  My question is simple.  Was a recommendation in line with IBEC's proposal made to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for inclusion in this year's Finance Bill or will it be made for the l999 budget?  If that is the case, we have already lost one year.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Higgins will understand the significance of my reference to l999.  That is when section 35 will have to be reviewed.  It is in that context I referred to the l999 budget.  Obviously, the Government gives consideration each year to all such issues in the context of the budget and the Finance Bill.  The current indications are that there is a steady increase in the level of film production in Ireland. As the Deputy correctly stated, I have contended that we should examine the question of a 100 per cent tax relief, but I do not want to pre-empt any decisions that are likely to be taken by the think tank.  The objective of setting up such an expert body is to get the views of those directly involved at all levels of the industry.  The Deputy is correct in stating that we should examine every proposal.</P>
      <P>Some would contend that circumstances do not warrant change or that such change would have a negative impact as an increased influx of purely tax driven international productions with little or no cultural content could crowd out indigenous producers.  While such productions will always form a welcome element of our participation in what is an international industry, our core objective at all times is to ensure that we have a strong indigenous based production system.  All those issues must be examined by the think tank in the context of the next five to ten years.  When I was in Opposition we referred to this matter many times and I know the Deputy will agree that education and other long-term issues are important. The think tank will deal with those matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's conversion to my emphasis on the indigenous sector. When I was in Government and she was in Opposition she criticised me for neglecting the loss of revenue from the large budget tax induced films. Was a study carried out post the INDECON report on the effects of the reduction of the relief from 100 per cent to 80 per cent?  I merely ask this question to assist the Minister in her efforts to devise a five to ten year plan.  Is the steady increase to which she referred in gross spend or in the number of projects?</P>

      <P>I must correct the Deputy, because I have not been on the road to Damascus yet.  I have my views on the rate of relief which I <Col N="973" /> can put to the various fora.  The think tank will consider this matter and it may agree with the 100 per cent rate, but I will not pre-empt its views.  Is the Deputy asking about the impact of the reduction of the relief from 100 per cent to 80 per cent?</P>

      <P>Following the reduction of tax relief from 100 per cent to 80 per cent in l996, the value of projects and the Irish expenditure content of films certified dropped substantially on previous years.  This was obviously a cause for concern.  Figures available for l997 indicate, however, that this downturn has been reversed and consequently the case for further tax expenditure at this point is not sustainable.  Those are the views that have been put forward, but the matter can be examined in full by the think tank.</P>

Until those discussions have concluded it would be premature to say what is likely to happen in regard to the 1989 Act.  The island contains significant elements of literary and natural heritage which I want to <Col N="976" /> preserve and conserve as part of our heritage. The question of repealing the 1989 Act or any other proposals would be premature.

      <P>I do not propose to attend the next meeting of the International Whaling Commission to be held in Oman commencing on 27 April.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter.  Will the Minister agree that, as almost all cetacean species spend part of their migration in coastal waters, the proposal made by Ireland, if accepted by the International Whaling Commission, will result in significant numbers of extra whales being killed in the exclusive economic zones of various countries?  What guarantee is there that Japan which currently catches approximately 400 mink whales per year in the area will not continue to kill whales in the southern oceans sanctuary? Has the Minister or her representative received a communication from South Korea which had a <Col N="978" /> strong whaling tradition, to the effect that it will not resume whaling on a commercial basis if Norway and Japan are allowed to do so?  This also applies to countries such as Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Iceland and Russia.  There is a substantial illegal trade in whalemeat which is engaged in principally by Japan and Norway.  The reports of the International Whaling Commission clearly indicate substantial mismanagement, exploitation of scientific information, false reporting and fraud.  In a report on the former Soviet Union the secretary to the commission indicated that the extent to which whaling reports were falsified was staggering.  Will the Minister and her representative push for an amendment to Regulation 10E of the international whaling regulations which stipulated that there should be no further catches after the 1985-86 pelagic season and that a comprehensive assessment should be carried out by 1990?  Nothing has happened and whales continue to die.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that this matter was the subject of lengthy discussion on a previous occasion.  We all agree that the number of whales killed should be minimised and that we should consider how this can be achieved and enforced in a practical way.  There has been a huge increase in the number of whales being killed.  The Government has expressed its views at the International Whaling Commission. We do not agree with killing whales and have declared the seas off our shores a sanctuary; something of which we can be proud.  Unfortunately, this view is not shared by countries such as Japan and Norway.  There is, therefore, a need to reach consensus.  The compromise we have suggested will be considered in Oman on 27 April.  I am well aware there is illegal trade.  If consensus can be reached, it would strengthen the hand of those who wish to prevent the killing of whales.  The document produced by our commissioner suggests an administrative and legal framework for the implementation of our proposal. It is one thing to enact laws but it is another to ensure they are enforced.  We need to adopt a practical approach.  I have every confidence in our commissioner and the other official who will attend the meeting.  The issues facing the International Whaling Commission are serious and did not arise in the past year or two.  Our proposal has stimulated debate and discussion which I hope will lead to a practical solution.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Is the Minister aware that many individuals and groups concerned with the preservation of the whale are dismayed at the position adopted by our representative at the International Whaling Commission?  Has she discussed the matter with him?  Will she rethink our proposal as many experts are of the view that it could lead to the whale being endangered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's position that there should be a major decrease in the number <Col N="979" /> of whales killed.  To satisfy our consciences we could adopt an absolutist stance.  If we leave it at that it will not save many whales.  We must try to bring others with us in a consensus.</P>
      <P>I have received some letters expressing concerns about whaling, although not very many, some of which have been in the form of circulars.  I have endeavoured to answer each letter.  The Irish position has been clearly explained and I have yet to hear back from any of those people who have shown genuine concern on the issue.  Many of those are relieved to hear exactly how the Government, through the commissioner, intends to proceed.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister does not want to adopt a position whereby we support an increased slaughter of whales.  Will our commissioner, with the Minister's support, seek to ensure that this proposal will be given effect in international law?  Whaling ships can be tracked by satellite and are readily controllable if the resources are made available.  There is no point in having a change in policy which will result in an increased slaughter if it cannot be given effect in international law.</P>

      <P>That is the point I made.  It is important not to be emotive on this issue and not to refer inaccurately to the &ldquo;increased slaughter of whales&rdquo;.  We are seeking the exact opposite by trying to ensure that countries which do not share our view and slaughter whales will be restricted in doing so.  That must be done through a legal and administrative framework.  The proposals have been put forward by our commissioner and were outlined by me in the House a few weeks ago.  They are the lines on which the discussions will proceed in Oman on 27 April.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the number of national monuments and historic properties under the aegis of my Department has increased significantly since 1990, the most recently acquired being the 17th century Kilmacurragh House and Arboretum in County Wicklow.  Negotiations are currently in progress between officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and various concerned parties with a view to acquiring a number of additional properties of major heritage significance. In any given year the number of such properties could be of the order of five or six but, given the nature of property acquisition, it would <Col N="980" /> not be appropriate to identify such properties until the negotiations have been completed.  I can inform the Deputy, however, that some funds are at my disposal to acquire properties &mdash; whether national monuments or historic properties or lands adjacent thereto to enhance their presentation &mdash; and I intend to continue a prudent acquisitions policy as opportunities and resources permit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I will make the best possible use of moneys that become available.  There are a number of national monuments, historic properties and related lands which the State would like to acquire but such acquisition would depend on the resources available.  The Department is interested in acquiring such properties and there has been a significant increase in the acquisition of properties since 1990.  There are a number of properties in which we have a particular interest and negotiations are taking place.  Given the nature of property acquisition it would not be appropriate for me to speak about individual properties. Hopefully, when and if they are acquired we will be able to announce it to the Deputy.</P>

There would be a requirement for the classification of plants and the Minister would have my support in any case she might make for an increase in the staff of the Botanic Gardens to facilitate the more expeditious transfer of properties to the State.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The Deputy will be aware that a commitment to establish a national cultural institutions council is contained in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  In order that the proposed council should not be merely a talking shop but should be of use and benefit to the participants on the council, I intend to arrange, at an early date, a seminar involving the directors of the institutions concerned to hear their views on the proposal and on the most appropriate organisational model that might be adopted and the precise terms of reference that might apply to the operation of the council.</P>

It may be assumed that membership will be drawn from the cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department.  I hope to make a public announcement soon with regard to the setting up of a council, but prior to doing that I want to consult the institutions involved.  The Deputy asked me about the type of model envisaged. That and the council's terms of reference are questions that will be discussed with those involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Prior to the adjournment of the debate, I was in the process of thanking the Minister for accepting the thrust of the amendment tabled by Deputies Noonan, Kenny, Ring and myself on Committee Stage for which Deputy Kenny made such a good case.  However, I want to express my disappointment and reservation in regard to the last few lines of the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 28 January.  He stated:</P>
      <P>When such projects come forward and are approved by the relevant authorities, the individual enterprise areas will be designated and submitted to the EU Commission for its approval.  It should be noted that under the Commission's decision, the provisions for all of the enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act will have to terminate on 31 December 1999 instead of 30 June 2000.  To date, no specific proposal from, or on behalf of, a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations adjacent to Knock Airport has been submitted to me.</P>
      <P>As of 28 January, no application for a qualifying project seemed to have been made.  It is now March 1998 and the termination date has been brought forward by six months from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 1999.  In view of the fact that no proposal has been made, and in view of the excitement which existed in regard to the potential effect of the designation of the airport, I urge the Minister to see what can be done to ensure the original date is adhered to.</P>
      <P>Designation is crucial to the survival of this area and the maximum amount of qualifying activities should be included in that.  The Minister will be aware, having worked in the area for a number of years, that it has been characterised as the &ldquo;black triangle&rdquo;.  It is an area which has been devastated by emigration and unemployment and has seen entire townlands and villages wiped out. I have, on occasion, drawn reference to the comparison between the number of townlands which existed in the area in 1926 when the first census of population was taken after the foundation of the State and the 1996 census.  The figures speak for themselves.  Townlands which were alive and vibrant in 1926 are now desolate and empty, but there is a great expectation that this area has arrived in terms of the potential of the airport designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the representations made to Europe are successful and that, as stated in <i>The Western People</i>, &ldquo;Pádraig will deliver&rdquo;.  In a December issue of <i>The Western People</i>, Commissioner Flynn stated that we were all in the same corner on this <Col N="986" /> matter.  If designation is not successful, certain people will be in a very tight corner indeed.  I know the Minister will do his best and I hope Commissioner Flynn will deliver on his promises. He cannot say one thing in Castlebar and another in Brussels; the moment of truth has arrived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I was somewhat amused by some of the contributions made in the House before lunch.  I am a new Deputy but I already seem to be rattling Deputy Kenny quite considerably. One would be forgiven for thinking that this amendment was not necessary at all because, in May 1997, prior to the general election, some very outlandish and over-zealous comments were made by Deputies from County Mayo about industries coming to Knock Airport.  One would certainly have been forgiven for thinking that these were already included in the lists of designated companies.  It was with some surprise that most people in County Mayo discovered that freight forwarding was not included in the definition of designated companies and with even greater surprise that they discovered that the EU seemed to know nothing whatsoever about the proposals.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Coveney's contribution before lunch and I want to compliment him as he seems a fairly reasonable man.  I assure him that the reason this amendment is on the table has nothing to do with the contribution of Deputies Kenny and Jim Higgins but is due to my lobbying of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  The previous Government could not deliver on this issue but this one will.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment because at present, as Deputy Higgins correctly stated, there is no proposal for any company to locate at Knock Airport.  I believe there is only one proposal, under the tax designation as it currently stands, in regard to an airport in Deputy Coveney's constituency.  It is very important for the future of Knock Airport, County Mayo and the western region as a whole that this definition is broadened to incorporate freight forwarding and other airport-related activities.  Certain essential services are not currently available at Knock and, unless these are brought into being, it will be impossible for us to attract the industry which the airport so badly needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, finds himself in a very difficult position.  As a result of the outlandish comments made earlier last year, which I can only regard as having been an election gimmick, the Minister finds himself in a position where EU attention has been drawn to this issue when it need never have been.  Had the EU been consulted on the matter and had it been aware of the Government's intentions, it would not have been necessary for clarification to have been sought.  If there is a difficulty in this matter getting through at EU level, it will not be the fault of this Government.  The Minister, Deputy <Col N="987" /> McCreevy, has done all he can do in including this amendment in the Finance Bill and every effort must now be made at EU level to secure approval on this matter.</P>
    <P>I ask all Deputies to bear in mind that this is bigger than a mere political issue and is vital for the well-being of County Mayo.  It is not a matter which can be played around with.  There was a good deal of talk about <i>The Western People</i> article; the paper is probably getting good publicity from this debate.  Tax designation for Knock Airport will benefit everyone in the western region.  It has the potential to create many jobs if every effort is made at every level and if every support is given by Members of the House.  I compliment the Minister and wish him well in his negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>I welcome the amendment.  I addressed the problems facing Kerry County Airport on Committee Stage and I pointed out that, in order for designation to work, more incentives like this were required.  As of now, the designation of Kerry County Airport has not created the vibrancy which might have been expected. These provisions, if successful in Europe, will hopefully do that.</P>
      <P>Last year's accounts for Kerry County Airport were published recently and show that profits are down substantially on the previous year.  That bears out my point that, in order for these regional airports to survive, they must have advantages over other airports.  The Minister's amendment will not necessarily mean that Knock Airport or Kerry County Airport will have any advantages over Cork Airport but it will certainly provide them with an opportunity to develop their services.</P>
      <P>We should ask ourselves why this package of incentives is not proving successful for our regional airports.  The airports probably do not have the capacity to promote the incentives.  Perhaps the Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, could put in place a promotional programme which would attempt to maximise the benefits of the incentive scheme. There is obviously a major incentive for operators but the message is not getting through.  Perhaps a direct marketing campaign could be put in place to advertise this scheme, especially in view of the fact that the Minister's amendment would further strengthen it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has done a good day's work.  I compliment him on living up to his contribution when he was in Opposition.  He spoke on last year's Finance Bill and pointed out that as a member of the Opposition and of a previous Government some years ago, he took a different view on the development of Knock Airport.  He said last year that he supported its development, which he took on board when he had the opportunity to do something positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained on Committee Stage the reasons behind, and the mechanics of, the drafting of the <Col N="988" /> designation last year.  Deputy Cooper-Flynn chose not to be present at that meeting and I am not sure whether she heard what was said on her monitor.  Perhaps she was preparing to lobby the Minister in the hallway.  That method of government is fine as long as it achieves results.  The important thing is that the Minister accepted our amendment and we can seek approval through the European Commission.  Deputy Cooper-Flynn will also know that as the EU was not aware of the designation of the seven regional airport, neither was it aware of the designation originally given to the enterprise zones.  We cannot have government by secrecy.  It is as well these matters are known when they occur.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being a good and practical politician.  This measure is important and the Minister and the Government have our full support in seeking final approval from the EU, in the hope it will lead to further development and provide the missing piece of the jigsaw.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for contributing to this debate.  The part of Mayo in which Knock Airport is situated is the part of Ireland I know best apart from my county.  I spent many years there and the accountancy practice of which I was a partner has an interest in that area.  I agree that it is the region of the country which has changed the most in the past 30 years.  The population has declined, along with sustainable industries.  However, there is a great vibrancy there despite the figures showing the Celtic tiger is not as strong.  I wish everybody who goes ahead with any venture there well.</P>
      <P>I seem to have featured in <i>The Western People</i> more often recently.  I am sorry Deputy Cooper-Flynn only got me a line or two this week while Deputy Ring gave me a full page about three weeks ago, referring to me all over the front page. I think the headline may also have featured my name.  I did not see the article, but it was brought to my attention.  I would prefer to be on Deputy Cooper-Flynn's side of the argument.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins asked why the end date was brought forward to the end of 1999.  In last year's negotiations which were not concluded until the middle of December, it was agreed that state aids for all EU states will end on 31 December 1999.  It will be not be impossible for the Government to renew some of these measures because they will have to be included in the new state aids programmes.  The cut-off date applies to the designation of airports, enterprise zones and other areas.  That does not mean the Government will be unable to renew some of these incentives in a wide variety of areas. However, they will have to be considered under the new regime.  That date was a prerequisite in order to get the package approved last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan asked about the promotion of the enterprise zones.  As I said on Committee Stage, there is only one project on the table, which is in the Cork region.  I do not know why <Col N="989" /> nothing has happened since the changes were announced in the Finance Act, 1997.  All the regional airports are aware of the incentive, as are Forfás, Forbairt and the IDA, which are responsible for promoting projects in the regions. It is not necessary to bring it to their attention again, but I am sure when these development agencies are promoting a particular region they bring this type of incentive to the forefront in dealing with prospective businesses which wish to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I gave a detailed outline on Committee Stage of what happened in 1997.  For one reason or another, qualifying activities did not include this activity.  We went to the EU last week and I will include a commencement order in the Bill.  Hopefully I will be able to convince the people in Brussels this is a worthwhile venture and it will get approval.</P>
    <P>I am trying to stay away from the politics of County Mayo as I do not want to feature in <i>The Western People</i> as coming down on one side or the other.  In fairness to Deputy Cooper-Flynn, she buttonholed me and rang me at all hours of the day and night on this issue, as did other Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 50, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;Section 286 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3) In respect of any bus used for the carriage of members of the public there shall be available free depreciation for the purposes of determining what capital allowances are available to a person for any chargeable period.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> This is a focused and targeted amendment.  It will provide free depreciation on buses which is a 100 per cent capital allowance in year one.  This will allow financial institutions to provide competitive leasing rates and arrangements to Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and private bus operators.</P>
    <P>We are tabling this amendment because my party takes a great interest in the traffic difficulties of Dublin.  It is evident, and Deputy Olivia Mitchell will speak at more length on this, that there are not enough buses and that many of them are not modern or in the best condition.  If we are to make an impact, we must take some motor cars off the road and get people to use public transport.  Public transport is acceptable when it is good, which is why the DART has been such a success.  Some public transport systems are not successful because they are mediocre and serve no purpose.  If we are serious about encouraging people to use public transport, which is necessary if we are to avoid gridlock, then we must invest heavily in it.</P>
    <P>A related area is private bus operators.  Every weekend private buses transport many people from Dublin to various areas.  Some of these buses are in a poor condition and if a similar targeted provision was made for private bus operators it would ensure a higher quality service.  The Minister for Education and Science is carrying out a study of the school transport system which is dying on its feet, so to speak, because of a lack of investment.  Many of these buses are past their sell-by date and need to be replaced.  There is a need for investment in buses at all levels.  This is an expensive business and even the Celtic tiger cannot provide the funds required in the years ahead.  I, therefore, commend acceptance of our targeted amendment by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment which attempts to reduce the cost to Dublin Bus and private bus operators of replacing, expanding and upgrading their fleets. The Minister has a clear choice between giving financial institutions incentives to invest in buses and lease them to Dublin Bus and directly funding the cost of replacing the fleet.</P>
      <P>One element of the Government's strategy for dealing with the traffic chaos is to encourage people to switch from private to public transport. Obviously this cannot happen without an increase in capacity.  When the matter is raised in the House the Minister for Public Enterprise repeats the Government's strategy like a mantra as if merely saying it will make it happen.  If a strategy is to be meaningful it must be properly funded and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to encourage a switch from private to public transport and alleviate the traffic problems in Dublin there must be adequate capacity. At present the capacity cannot meet the demand. It is ludicrous that the main transport provider in the capital city must fund the cost of new buses out of the yield from bus fares, while at the same time trying to cover everyday costs.  The subvention <Col N="991" /> paid to CIE is gobbled by the money hungry rail service.  While this is understandable, it does not solve the problems of Dublin Bus.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow the number of buses put on the road by Dublin Bus at any one time to be dictated by the need to break even financially. Such a situation is inimical to obtaining a switch from private to public transport.  I am perplexed by the apparent inconsistencies in the Minister's response to this point on Committee Stage.  He said he did not believe the traffic congestion was getting worse, yet later he said:</P>
    <P>I predict that the city will grind to a halt some day, and that is the only way the traffic problems in Dublin will be solved.  There will be gridlock for about five days and action will have to be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The public elects a Government to prevent this sort of thing happening; it is only the Government which stands between the public and this kind of anarchy.  Given that the Minister has made this prediction, I hope he will take action to prevent it.  I have often heard this type of remark, but responsibility for the solution rests on the Minister's shoulders.  The only way the traffic problems in Dublin can be solved is by a proper public transport system which is adequately funded.</P>
    <P>The budget was a missed opportunity in many areas.  The DTO proposed that measures should be introduced in the budget to promote and finance public transport in Dublin.  However, the main measure relating to traffic was the extension of the tax incentive to build car parks in the city centre.  One does not have to be a transport expert to know that the availability of parking will lead to an increase in the number of cars in the city.  The budget should have given incentives to provide park and ride facilities at designated sites on the public transport corridor or at the periphery of the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the banks and financial institutions would use the measure proposed in the amendment to obtain tax breaks and that the State would lose tax revenue.  While this is evident, the budget contains numerous measures designed to encourage certain behaviour and to discourage other behaviour.  Our measure is a more efficient way of providing for the capital needs of Dublin Bus.  In the past the Minister recommended this way of obtaining finance for the public sector.  It would also be much cheaper than the cost of gridlock which is estimated at between £0.5 billion and £1 billion.  The tax revenue foregone is conservatively estimated at £125 million.  I am sure the Minister would not turn his back on the collection of this money.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this amendment will solve all of Dublin's traffic problems.  The provision and availability of buses is only part of the solution but it is a prerequisite to achieving it.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment even at this late stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage and I will not repeat all the points I made.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the incentives given for building multi-storey car parks.  These incentives are coming to an end and all I can say is good riddance to them.  She also said there is a cogent case for providing incentives to build car parks, multi-storey or otherwise, which are associated with the use of public transport, specifically park and ride facilities.  It could be left to Iarnród Éireann or Dublin Bus to certify the car parks which could be used in association with public transport.  We should not have given incentives to build multi-storey car parks which merely encourage commuters to bring their cars into the city centre.</P>
      <P>Given current budgetary circumstances, the replacement of the Dublin Bus fleet should be funded by way of direct subvention.  This was done in the case of Iarnród Éireann's rolling stock on some routes.  There is a crying need there.  As I understand it, a large part of the fleet needs to be replaced over the next five years or so.  There is also a need for an additional fleet of Imp buses, which are popular with commuters.  I understand that Dublin Bus does not have enough of them as things stand.  I appreciate this will not be cheap, but it is clearly within the realm of a transport infrastructure in which we should invest.  While I do not need to go into a graphic description, we are all well aware of the gridlock which currently pertains in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>It is not frequently appreciated that the subvention to Dublin Bus is very small, amounting to 1 or 2 per cent of its total running costs, and has been rapidly decreasing in recent years.  A public perception is fostered by commentators with an ideological viewpoint, that Dublin Bus is subvented up to the hilt but nothing could be further from the truth.  As Deputy Mitchell has already pointed out, the overwhelming part of the subsidy to CIE companies goes on rail and Dublin Bus is subvented only to a tiny degree.</P>
      <P>For many years we have undercapitalised so many of our public companies, including Dublin Bus.  While I appreciate this may not always be the case, I urge the Minister in current circumstances to invest directly in the transport infrastructure of Dublin Bus by directly subventing the purchase of a new fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my Fine Gael colleagues. I urge the Minister to accept this worthy amendment.  We should view fiscal measures as a way of improving the quality of life and of our environment.  I commend the Minister for accepting, on Committee Stage, Deputy McDowell's amendment concerning solar power.  We have a serious problem, however, in Dublin.  The Minister is aware that we are approaching gridlock. We also have a serious air pollution problem, much of which is due to buses.  We know there is a problem in relation to volatile organic compounds and compounds such as PM2.5s and PM10s.  These terms may not mean much to <Col N="993" /> people but the EPA report shows we have high levels of these compounds which are highly carcinogenic. People are dying in this city because of air pollution and one way to tackle it is by investing in clean buses.  I urge the Minister to consider this because people's lives are on the line.  We are talking about young children and the elderly suffering from respiratory illnesses, including asthma.  I hope in future we will not use diesel buses but will have the best type of LPG or natural gas buses.</P>
      <P>In addition to investing in these, we also need to speed up the process, as advocated by the DTO, by designating more quality bus corridors which have been slow to come into service.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with Dublin Bus and privately there is a great deal of frustration in that there is not much subvention compared to other countries where, as a matter of course, public transport is seen as a public service.  That approach means having more efficient cities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell already referred to the fact that we are losing about £500 million but that is only in terms of delay; it does not take into account the levels of stress caused and other health implications. We can be extremely short-sighted in not taking into account the external costs.  So often, by using only basic arithmetic, we do not see the whole story.  For those reasons I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  We can use fiscal measures to improve the quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to provide accelerated capital allowances up to 100 per cent in year one for capital expenditure incurred on the provision of buses.  The present capital expenditure on buses can be written off over five years at the rate of 20 per cent per annum.  Taxis and cars for short-term hire are entitled to 40 per cent per annum.  Since the early 1990s accelerated capital allowances have generally been phased out in a general reform of the tax system with the objective of broadening the tax base.  However, prior to these reforms, at no stage were buses entitled to accelerated capital allowances.</P>
      <P>The move in the direction now suggested would seem to be a retrograde step.  There is also the significant consideration that accelerated capital allowances for buses would encourage financial institutions to become involved in the leasing of buses.  This would be inevitable.  Accelerated capital allowances could not, for instance, be availed of by CIE or Dublin Bus because of the lack of taxable capacity to absorb the allowances. However, financial institutions could avail of the allowances and would benefit substantially as lessors. The consequence would be a reduced tax yield from financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further consideration that measures such as this, which may be intended to provide extra bus capacity as an alternative to other forms of transport, should not be considered in isolation.  A much broader view needs to be taken of the transportation area as a whole, bearing in mind the future requirements of the <Col N="994" /> various competing elements in the system &mdash; in particular, that the lack of accelerated capital allowances is curtailing bus activity.</P>
    <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  I commend the Deputies on, at least, debating the transport issue and the deteriorating traffic in Dublin which, in addition to its economic cost, is causing stress to many people.</P>
    <P>I recognise the bona fides of the Deputies in making their contributions and I would accede to the amendment if I could be convinced that this measure would do anything to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin.  However, I am not so inclined because I cannot see that providing free depreciation &mdash; meaning writing off the capital expenditure on buses &mdash; will do anything to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin.  It would give rise to another form of tax-based leasing which the financial institutions would take up.  It would lessen the return on corporation tax from the financial institutions and, therefore, lessen the take coming into the Exchequer.  That, in turn, would lessen the amount of money I could use to subvent Dublin Bus and the other services.  It would be a decreasing circle.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of tax-based leasing, it should be borne in mind that all the incentives, some of which I introduced myself, involve a cost to the ordinary taxpayer.  People generally forget that if one approaches the Government with a proposition to spend £50 million or £60 million it becomes part of the Exchequer Vote on expenditure. People do not regard it as any loss to the Exchequer under a tax-based incentive scheme, but it is the exact same cost to the Exchequer because the tax is foregone.  In all these tax-based leasing incentives, one must take into account the tax that is foregone.  If we return to a system of giving free depreciation &mdash; a system we left many years ago &mdash; to help Dublin Bus, it will mean nothing to the company.  This is because it does not have a taxable income in order to pay a tax liability.</P>
    <P>Presumably, a financial institution would buy the buses and lease them to Dublin Bus or CIE because it would have sufficient rental income to offset the free depreciation on the capital allowances. The financial institution would then possibly give the lease at a lower rate to Dublin Bus or CIE.  We had this debate many years ago concerning section 84 leasing and other matters, but the principles are broadly the same.  I am trying to point out to Deputy Mitchell that free depreciation, or accelerated capital allowances as it is phrased in the amendment, will do nothing directly for Dublin Bus.  It would have to be taken up by a lending institution that would do it in the way I have described.  There would be a loss to the Exchequer, however, in that the lending institution would lower its tax burden because it would have a legitimate write off.  I would end up with less money for the Exchequer while the company itself would have higher after tax profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> This amendment will do nothing to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin.  As I outlined, there is a cost in any of these incentives and people should bear that in mind when putting forward such proposals which do not clearly show the tax cost.  I outlined the cost of various reliefs in reply to a number of parliamentary questions, including a recent question from Deputy Gormley on the cost of the seaside resort relief scheme, which is also a tax based incentive.  I understand he put down a series of questions on the cost of those particular schemes. He is now proposing a tax based scheme which will also involve a cost.  I do not want to make a political point but the argument being made is illogical.  I understand the reason Deputies put forward such arguments.  It is not as clear a cost as, say, CIE getting £105 million every year.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Committee Stage I gave vent to my feelings about the traffic problem in Dublin.  I am an expert on travelling to the city centre because for the past 31 years I have travelled in from County Kildare either on the Galway or the Naas Road.  For eight of those years I travelled by CIE provincial bus and I have seen many changes in that period.  I have also witnessed improvements in the roads approaching the city and those in the city centre.  I had to travel through various parts of the city centre during all that period towards Sheriff Street, St. Stephen's Green or Belfield and back to the other side of the city centre, but always through O'Connell Street and I have seen the traffic problem getting increasingly worse over the years.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I expressed the view that this problem will not be addressed until there is gridlock in the city.  Many suggestions could be put forward to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin which could be put into effect as part of a total package but there is one obstacle in that regard &mdash; democracy.  If we tried to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin by operating a definite system from 1 January next year, there would be an outcry from various sectors.  Politicians would be harried by car owners and others and it would be impossible to operate the system.  This problem will not be addressed until something dramatic happens overnight, such as total gridlock in the city of Dublin.  I am reminded of the film &ldquo;The Italian Job&rdquo;, produced over 25 years ago, which involved pulling off a major scam by creating gridlock in the city.</P>
    <P>Various proposals have been put forward from a variety of sources on how to address this problem. If they were to be put into effect there would be a degree of inconvenience for a certain period. However, people would not be willing to accept that and the Government responsible for introducing the measure would be harried by the Opposition. Public acceptability would not be forthcoming. Piecemeal solutions will not address the traffic problem in Dublin but we will not see the difficult decisions being made until something <Col N="996" /> dramatic happens.  I have held that view for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>With the Celtic tiger making gigantic leaps in recent years, there has been an increase in car ownership and the growth in prosperity will further exacerbate the problem.  In regard to car ownership in Ireland, I was alarmed to hear from one of my officials before the budget that we are considerably below the UK average per 1,000 of population and even further below the EU average. Car numbers will increase and I do not know where they will be accommodated on the streets of Dublin.  I gave the actual figures for car ownership on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell approached this problem from a different angle and there is some logic in that approach.  He is not in favour of tax relief for multi-storey car parks.  I understand where he is coming from in that regard and he is glad this relief is being phased out although he is not necessarily against tax relief for park and ride facilities as part of a total plan.  There is little point in me putting forward the idea of tax reliefs for park and ride facilities but they should be considered in the context of a comprehensive and integrated traffic plan for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view on Committee Stage that, from my own survey, I have calculated that 19 out of 20 cars travelling from the suburbs of Dublin have only one passenger.  If car numbers increase something dramatic will have to occur before the problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised the question of giving a direct subvention to Dublin Bus.  The subvention in 1997 was approximately £105 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>For a period of my life I worked for an accountancy practice which produced the school transport bill for the Department of Education and Science and the figures made interesting reading.  I understand the cost now is in the order of £30 million or £33 million. In the period to which I referred the cost was approximately £6 million.  I learned a great deal about the accountancy techniques of CIE in allocating costs over a wide variety of activities, including Dublin Bus.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley referred to the additional costs of subventions and tax reliefs.  I accept there are other costs in the health area and elsewhere but I do not believe this particular measure put forward by Deputy Mitchell will have any effect in alleviating the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is certainly large and I concur with the Minister in that regard.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept Deputy Olivia Mitchell's amendment, will he consider similar proposals which would have an effect?  As a practising accountant the Minister will be aware that using the MED 1 form people can claim back their medical expenses for the previous year.  Is there any reason a combination of the proposal put forward by Deputy Mitchell and one which would allow people using Dublin Bus, regardless of whether they are from Dublin, who purchase an annual commuter ticket at a cost of £200 per year, claim it back against tax as they claim back medical expenses could not be considered.</P>
      <P>The tax system is used for all sorts of incentive purposes.  Notwithstanding what was said by the Commission on Taxation about some of these matters, we retain VHI, medical expenses that are not refundable, mortgage interest relief and so on.  The business expansion scheme has been used in various parts of the country and there is a need for some incentive in Dublin.  If the proposal put forward by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, which is a very imaginative one, was combined with a proposal to allow commuters to purchase an annual ticket, with a photograph to ensure it is not transferable, for use on Dublin transport by people in the State, that might encourage the use of public transport.  Since the MED 1 form is simple, it would be relatively easy to introduce such a system.</P>
      <P>If banks were induced to provide additional buses for the Dublin Bus fleet, as proposed by Deputy Olivia Mitchell &mdash; that is only one of a number of imaginative proposals put forward by the Deputy in a recent policy document &mdash; and commuters were allowed claim the cost of their travel ticket against tax, many people would use public transport and leave their cars at home. Some such incentive is needed.  If the Minister puts his mind to address this question, there is room to do so in the tax system.</P>
      <P>The proposal for the £1,000 car scrappage scheme was put forward for a number of years before it was taken on board in a Finance Bill.  If I recall correctly, Minister after Minister rubbished the idea and said it would not work for all sorts of reasons, such as the Minister put forward today.  Yet that scheme worked and the industry's comments on it were correct.  If we learn from the experience of the section 84 provision, which created problems for the Exchequer in the context of the banks, and consider some adaptation of that system, embracing the proposal put forward by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, together with the proposal for an incentive for the commuter to claim the cost of an annual ticket against tax, the tax system could be used as part of the fight back against the serious transport problems in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Use of public transport along the DART corridor is significantly greater than in parts of the city where the DART is not available &mdash; 50 per cent as compared to 25 per cent. There is reason for hope there and there is a proven record for public transport.  Does the Minister intend to follow the route of direct subvention in renewing the fleet for Dublin Bus?  I would not support section 84 base leasing again.  It allowed financial institutions to reduce their taxation to a level that was unacceptable and I would not support anything of that kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his seductive and charming way, responded to a number of our amendments today by saying that a much broader approach is needed, and we do not deny that, but those measures would be of assistance.  I do not understand why setting up interdepartmental committees and groups to study issues, as referred to by the Minister on a number of occasions, should stop us in our tracks, thereby allowing a gridlock.  This is a constructive proposal which should be considered.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say it is all the same whether we pay for buses or give incentives to financial institutions to fund them.  If the State agrees to pay £100,000 for a bus, that is the amount that will be spent by the State.  If an efficient leasing system was introduced, the most the financial institution could leverage would be £100,000 at the current tax rate, but Bus Éireann or whatever company is involved would negotiate such a low leasing rate that it would take up some of the tax benefit.  To infer, as the Minister did, that we either pay for the bus or lose that amount in tax is not correct.</P>

From the point of view of the Exchequer, however, which will not always be in as good a position as it is today &mdash; the Minister will say it is not now in a position to spend money left, right and centre, which is needed to replace the bus fleet &mdash; this kind of carefully targeted scheme would to some extent alleviate the problem.  It would certainly result in the purchase of more buses.  The Minister's dismissal of the proposal because a broader approach is needed and because it would not be effective in financial terms is not compatible with the reality and the need that exists.

      <P>I am not competent to comment on the amendment as drafted by Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Coveney, but it focuses on one of the most urgent problems facing the country, particularly this city.  I do not wish to misrepresent the Minister, but to suggest that there must be a gridlock, as in &ldquo;The Italian Job&rdquo;, before we can deal with the traffic crisis in Dublin is unacceptable from him.  There are a great many issues with which we preoccupy ourselves and which people outside consider are somewhat esoteric but they certainly do not consider the present traffic gridlock in this city as esoteric. There is a requirement on the Minister to respond positively to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell made a fair point about the successive Ministers who told us why a car scrappage scheme would not work.  I know that my friends in the Department of Finance who I revere highly would not have ten year old cars, but nonetheless I know they are now convinced of the wisdom of the scrappage deal when it applied.  It may well be that they will come to be convinced of something along those lines to replace and augment the bus fleet.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to do something when it becomes clear to the public that his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, has put the Luas project at risk.  It is all very well for Deputy McDowell to talk about the contribution which has been made on the eastern corridor, but on the western side of the city the entire Luas project is now in danger of collapse because of the procrastination that has taken place.  That will create a greater urgency behind Deputy Olivia Mitchell's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> We have had a very good tempered debate on this Bill and many homilies from the Minister.  No man has packed so much living into so few years as the Minister, but homilies and homespun philosophy will not deal with this gridlock problem. There is a requirement on the Minister to state, in reply to Deputy Mitchell, what the Government will do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he had no evidence that a lack of allowances is curtailing the availability of Dublin Bus.  What is curtailing the availability of Dublin Bus is the absence of any form of subvention which would allow it to run additional buses.  Anything which will reduce Dublin Bus costs will allow it to put additional buses on the streets.</P>
      <P>I realise this amendment may be a tortuous way to proceed in that it is working through a third party in order to achieve a reduction in Dublin Bus costs.  I understand fully the notion that revenue forgone by the Exchequer is just as real as money spent by the Exchequer, but there is an obvious trade-off in the increase in revenue which can be gained by the huge increase in productivity which could be achieved in this city if virtually every business was not losing hundreds of man hours every week as a result of congestion.</P>
      <P>If the Minister lived in any Dublin suburb he would understand the problem.  Every day of the week there is something dramatic happening in the form of traffic chaos in Dublin.  It is becoming impossible to live in the city.  The quality of life has deteriorated beyond belief, quite apart from what is happening to the economy.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's point that democracy is stopping action taking place, that somehow democracy prevents any action by the Government.  Even in a democracy the Government is expected to show leadership, and the public is crying out for leadership, for somebody to grasp the nettle on the issue of Dublin traffic.</P>
      <P>I accept it is difficult to change people's behaviour and encourage them to leave their cars at home and use buses, particularly when over many years cars served them well and met their transport needs.  It is a long established practice and it is difficult to change that type of behaviour, but the public is ready for such a change.  It has always been accepted that implementing a switch from private to public transport would require a carrot and stick approach.  The carrot must be the availability of a good public transport system and that must be provided before one can start beating the public out of their cars.  Even the donkey gets the carrot before the stick.  I plead with the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I regard the situation pertaining to traffic in Dublin as very serious and that is why I spoke about it at considerable length on Committee Stage.  However, although I acknowledge Deputy Mitchell's goodwill in this regard and her innovative ideas, I do not accept <Col N="1001" /> that this amendment will do anything to alleviate the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out for all time tax incentives which could improve the traffic flow.  I am willing to consider for next year's budget some of the Deputy's ideas.  He used the analogy of the MED 1 form, that the cost of an annual Dublin Bus ticket incorporating the person's photograph could be allowed against tax.  I am not against innovative thinking in this regard.  As I said in reply to Deputy McDowell's suggestion, it may be possible in future years to introduce tax incentives for park and ride facilities around the city.</P>
      <P>More people would use public transport in Dublin if they thought it would be reliable and effective and it would get a person from one point to another in reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in regard to reliability. However, with regard to its effectiveness, the traffic situation is so chronic in Dublin that, despite the existence of bus lanes, buses are held up everywhere.  Therefore, only when the whole traffic problem is solved will it be possible to implement an effective plan for public transport &mdash; the two are well linked.</P>
      <P>I live in Celbridge, County Kildare, which is regarded as a suburb of Dublin.  Such towns have grown to such an extraordinary extent due to the overflow from Dublin that the traffic in them, and between them and Dublin, is colossal throughout the day.  It is impossible to get around those towns and commuters to Dublin in the morning and evening experience very heavy congestion.  We can introduce tax incentives and I am not ruling that out.  They may play a part, but Dublin needs an integrated traffic plan to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>I gave my personal views on the problem.  I stated that if we wanted to be radical about it we should set in place measures which the public will not be prepared to accept.  That is why I used the analogy of what I saw in the film &ldquo;The Italian Job&rdquo;.  Something desperate will have to happen so that people will accept some of the measures which will have to be implemented eventually.  It is not possible to introduce piecemeal solutions and this amendment will not go any way towards solving the problem.  I have been told by one of my officials that some years ago the authorities in Amsterdam gave motorists, whose cars contained at least three people, a monetary reward on the spot.</P>

      <P>This amendment refers to the limitation on the availability of capital allowances to investors capped in any tax year at £25,000.  We agree with the Minister's approach in that matter generally. This amendment, however, would exclude from that buildings in enterprise zones which are generally, if not always, located in areas of economic need and/or adjacent to areas of high unemployment. I am reminded of Gallanstown, formerly the Semperit site, which was established as an enterprise zone and the airports referred to earlier. These are targeted at high unemployment black spots or areas where there is a need to generate economic activity.  The amendment is reasonable to the extent that it would limit investment in those enterprise zones which, in any event, have a short and defined life.  We are not advocating extending capital allowances on an indefinite basis; they should only be extended for the duration of the enterprise zone designation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> Amendment No. 30 relates to section 27 which extends the determination date for the scheme of tax relief for the designated seaside resort areas by one year, from 30 June 1998 to 30 June 1999, to facilitate the completion of pipeline projects. If this extended period is to apply, certification will be required from the relevant local authorities if at least 15 per cent of the total cost of the project was incurred by 30 June 1998.</P>
    <P>The amendment appears to propose that buildings or structures coming within section 343 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 should be brought within the scope of section 27.  These are buildings or structures located in enterprise areas.  The intention would seem to be that the qualifying period in respect of such buildings should likewise be extended to the end of June 1999.  Relief for buildings in enterprise areas was originally provided for a three year period from 1 August 1994 to 31 July 1997.  This time limit was already extended by one year to 31 July 1998 in the Finance Act, 1997.  It is this corresponding one year extension that is now being provided for the resort areas in section 27.  There can be no question of a further one year extension in the case of enterprise areas.</P>
    <P>I should point out that enterprise areas, in addition to other areas covered under the 1994 urban renewal scheme, will benefit from the existing extension of five months to the end of December 1998 which is provided for in section 24, subject to the necessary conditions being fulfilled. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is seeking to extend the extension limit applying to enterprise zones to enterprise areas.  However, the purport of his remarks related to the Gallanstown area.  Restrictions in respect of capital allowances are more pertinent to amendment No. 31 and not amendment No. 30.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to extending the deadline for enterprise areas to 30 June 1999.  The current position in respect of enterprise areas is as follows.  The deadline for old areas such as East Wall has already been extended by one year to 31 July 1998.  With regard to new areas such as Finglas, Gallanstown and the regional airports, the deadline has been shortened by six months, to comply with the EU directive and EU approval, from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 1999.  The amendment is unnecessary in so far as these enterprise areas are concerned. The Deputy's remarks are more pertinent to amendment No. 31.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) This section shall not apply to an allowance to be made to an individual under Chapter 1 of Part 9 in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or after the 3rd day of December, 1997, on a specified building where before that date&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) (i) in the case of construction, the foundation for the specified building was laid in its entirety, or</P>

      <P>(iii) (I) in the case of a project, a notification of a decision to grant planning permission had issued, and</P>
      <P>(II) work to the value of 2 per cent of the total cost of that project was carried out, and</P>
      <P>(III) after that date a further 3 per cent of the total cost of that project was incurred by 1 June, 1998 under a binding building contract,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) an application for planning permission for the work represented by that expenditure on the specified building had (in so far as such permission is required) been received by a planning authority before the 3rd day of December, 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While we agree with the principle of the Minister's general action regarding the limitation of the use of capital allowances for hotels outside the seven nominated counties, we are concerned about the transitional arrangements which seem to be preventing some excellent and genuine projects from proceeding.  People have been genuinely upset in instances where they believed they had complied and where, for example, formal written commitments from investors were required by the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I presume they were only operating the law &mdash; before planning permission could be obtained.  In many cases it would be extremely difficult and unrealistic to obtain a formal written commitment from an investor for a project in respect of which planning permission had not been granted.  Most potential investors would not enter discussions with a developer who had not obtained planning permission.</P>
      <P>I look to the Minister to accept the amendment so that a measure of short-term flexibility could be implemented in respect of the proposed transitional arrangements.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I return to the point I made, apparently erroneously, in respect of amendment No. 30, about capping tax at £25,000.  We believe the <Col N="1005" /> Minister is correct in that regard, However, in the case of enterprise zones, which are generally located in areas of economic need and or adjacent to areas of high unemployment &mdash; this is an EU requirement for approval &mdash; we believe the cap ought to be removed for the duration of their designation period, which is specified and relatively short.  In that context, I referred to the regional airport and the Gallanstown project, formerly the Semperit site, which was specifically established for the purpose of generating employment in an area which experienced a traumatic loss of jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment refers to a project of which the Minister is aware.  Anomalies have arisen by virtue of the fact that the developer was asked to proceed in respect of the normal requirements, particularly those relating to planning permission, which predated the Finance Bill. I hope the Minister will give consideration to this project &mdash; I am not sure if it is the same one as that referred to by Deputy Coveney &mdash; in terms of the cost benefit analysis to the State.  The project is situated in an area where there is no other assistance available, no urbanisation and no tax incentives for urban renewal.  The county in which it is situated does not have access to many airports or seaside resorts.  The project is completely dependent on what was publicised and made available to other areas last year and before.</P>
      <P>The developer in question proceeded in good faith with the guidelines laid down by Revenue and the previous Finance Act.  When he had invested money in the initial planning stage and in the project, the Minister announced his intention to introduce a cap.  The project will become uneconomic if the benefits previously available do not accrue to the area in question.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the project to which I am referring as he met the developer involved.  I do not wish to place on record the name of the developer or the project with which he is involved.  However, the Minister should give consideration to the amendment because it would overcome the difficulty to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Acceptance would not open the floodgates because there are few projects which come within the parameters of this carefully worded amendment. The Minister should take account of the good faith in which the developer originally proceeded. I urge him to accept the amendment because it would make a significant and important contribution to the project with which I am involved.  That project would not subject the Exchequer to any unusual demands and it would have a cost benefit analysis of approximately £3 million.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that section 30 is included in the Finance Bill and I would hate to see it negated by an amendment such as this.  In my maiden speech in the Dáil I raised the question of capital allowances and their use by very high earners to become very wealthy.  The allowance was so generous that it would have been stupid <Col N="1006" /> of very high earners not to avail of it.  There are few very high earners who have not in the past availed of the capital allowances provision to make themselves more wealthy and, at the same time, avoid paying tax.  In that same maiden speech I suggested that the question of stallion stud fees should be looked at, and Deputy Ferris very quickly took me to task for it.  This amendment is badly constructed.  First, it provides that planning must have been granted.  Then it states that the section should not apply if an application for planning permission has been received by a planning authority.  Obviously, a planning permission cannot be granted unless the planning application has been received by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>In the Act the section which applies to the individual has been deleted.  If subsection (6) were retained after this amendment were accepted, it would be meaningless and would not apply to anything.  It is necessary to retain lines 32 to 40 whereby an individual has to be in negotiations, even preliminary negotiations, not necessarily, as Deputy Coveney has stated, formal written commitments. The Act refers to preliminary negotiations. I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will go with the spirit of the Act, and if preliminary negotiations have been entered into between investors and developers, that will be accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very aware of a project in my area that may not go ahead because of the announcement in the budget.  The Department is trying to facilitate the project, and this amendment would help.  The difficulty was that planning permission was applied for in respect of a hotel project in a tourism area.  Planning permission was obtained from the local authority but, two or three days before the final day for objecting, a third party objected and took the appeal to An Bord Pleanála and the board turned down the project.  Agreement has now been reached with the third party objector and a new application is ready to proceed.  This amendment would enable this very worthwhile project to proceed. The Minister is familiar with the project and with the area, and he is aware that a lift for tourism in this area is badly needed.  I hope this amendment will be accepted and will help this project.</P>

      <P>I want to correct the impression that might have been given by Deputy Ardagh's comments that the Opposition is in some way seeking to circumvent this proposal. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I repeat my explicit support in the past for the measures the Minister is adopting.  The amendment tabled by Deputies Ferris and Coveney is seeking simply to address the transitional arrangements which apply to projects which had permission before 3 December last.  That is reasonable.  We support the measure to restrict capital allowances for passive investors to £25,000.  However, it is appropriate that we ensure that we do not do an injustice to decent projects that were in the pipeline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I too am familiar with the project referred to by Deputies Coveney and Ferris, and I am aware of the hardship that will be created as a result of this provision in the Finance Bill.  There is a need for hotel development throughout the country, not only in the counties designated for special hotel development.  There is a need for a large number of hotels if we are to spread the tourist spend throughout the country, which is the desired objective of Bord Fáilte.  I am aware of only two projects, one in Wicklow and the other in Tipperary, that would be affected by this provision. Surely the Minister has the personnel to quantify what this would mean in terms of lost revenue. He will find that it does not amount to a large amount of money.  The Minister should consider it because it will result in financial ruin for a few individuals who went ahead with their projects unaware that this provision would be included in the Finance Bill.  If the Minister were personally aware of the hardship this will create he would be sympathetic to the operators involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney is asking for reasonable transitional arrangements to ensure that these operators can put their investors in place, which they did not have the opportunity to do before 3 <Col N="1008" /> December.  I do not see this as a tax shelter for the large number of people referred to by the Minister's colleague.  I see it as a genuine investment. If the Minister will not accept this amendment a very good project in the region in question will be abandoned and a few individuals will suffer financial hardship.  I ask the Minister to look at this very carefully.  He has accepted only one amendment tabled by the Opposition since this debate began.  This is one the Minister should consider seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is concerned with the transitional provisions relating to capital allowance restrictions introduced with effect from budget day.  These restrictions arise from the need to maintain a balance between the use of the tax system as an instrument of investment policy and the use of various tax incentive schemes by high net worth individuals to shelter excessive amounts of income against income tax.  For some time, highly tax efficient schemes have been marketed aimed at high net worth individuals, encouraging the investment of large sums of money in property at little or no risk to the investor and at maximum cost to the Exchequer.  In some cases, individual investors, facilitated by the low cost of borrowing, are putting up seven figure sums for individual projects.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to restrict the amount of capital allowance available to individual passive investors on industrial and commercial buildings, including hotels.  Subject to transitional provisions, the restrictions will apply generally to expenditure incurred after budget day on such buildings, including those in tax designated areas.  The restrictions will not, however, affect investments made by an individual owner-operator of a business, by an individual actively engaged in the operation and management of a business, investments made by individuals, including a passive investor in three star or better hotels in the counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo, other than in seaside resorts in those counties, or investments made by companies, including financial institutions in any of the developments in question.</P>
      <P>The amendment substitutes new transitional provisions for those already in place in the section dealing with industrial and commercial buildings other than hotels.  It has the effect of dropping all the requirements relating to the need for individuals to have entered into an obligation, preliminary commitment or agreement prior to budget day.  Since the restrictions apply to certain individuals only, namely passive investors, it is logical that the transitional provisions should not be exclusively set in terms of how advanced a building project is at a particular time.  The requirements relating to an obligation or preliminary commitment are positive and designed to facilitate building projects yet to get off the ground. Dropping these requirements could, therefore, have a negative effect and could rule out investment projects where investors had agreed to invest in a project, but the only action taken was an application for planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> The amendment would also rule out a number of facilitatory measures which I have added since budget day.  These are designed to allow projects to benefit from the transitional provisions in a number of ways, for example, where a building is for a project approved for grant assistance in the two years prior to budget day; where, in the absence of a planning application, it can be established that plans were in place and that detailed discussions had taken place with a planning authority and a written contract was in place before budget day; where a planning application was received or detailed discussions had taken place and negotiations were in progress before budget day, leading to the signing of a written contract before 1 May 1998.  That was extended from 1 February on budget day.</P>
    <P>These provisions allow investors the benefit of actions taken long before any construction has necessarily taken place and dropping them, as proposed in the amendment, would have serious consequences for many investment projects.  The amendment seeks to insert a number of additional clauses in the transitional provision, the first of which identifies a situation where &ldquo;a notification of a decision to grant planning permission had issued&rdquo;.  This is unnecessary as the provision already provides for circumstances in which a planning application has merely been received by a planning authority.  The other clauses provide for cases where 2 per cent of expenditure was incurred before budget day and a further 3 per cent by 1 June 1998.  The provisions already in place, which relate to work in progress or expenditure incurred, represent a reasonable attempt to provide for projects which have already got under way.  These provide for projects where the foundation was in place or 5 per cent of the refurbishment work was completed before budget day.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the restrictions is to ensure that individual passive investors cannot use tax incentive schemes to shelter excessive amounts of income from tax.  In this way, it is hoped the use of tax incentives to encourage targeted development can coexist with the principles of tax equity which require all taxpayers to contribute to the provision of State services.  Since budget day I have relaxed the transitional provisions considerably. This amendment, by breaking any link with obligations and commitments entered before budget day, could disimprove the position for cases currently meeting the transitional requirements. The restrictions are also limited in that they close off only one of a number of routes to development projects, namely, the passive investor route.  Owner-operator and corporate projects remain unaffected.  Therefore, project promoters have other options.</P>
    <P>I received a large number of representations prior to the budget, many of which related to the restriction on capital allowances.  I believed the transitional arrangements, which I amended slightly at the end of January, would be sufficient. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance are up to speed with the schemes that operate for commercial activity in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I had two reasons for introducing these restrictions. From personal experience, I became aware that a number of high income earners were using the schemes to reduce their tax liabilities.  Some of them boasted about the fact that they had very high incomes but were able to reduce their tax liabilities under these schemes.  The average industrial worker pays more income tax per annum than some of these people on colossal incomes.  If they had kept their mouths shut it might not have come to my attention.  It is a case of the poacher turned gamekeeper, because I know some of them through my practice.</P>
    <P>I announced on budget day that the Revenue Commissioners had undertaken a survey of high income earners in recent tax years.  That survey shows the different types of schemes being used by high income earners to reduce their tax liabilities. These are legal avoidance mechanisms, with which I have no difficulty.  Furthermore, incentives are necessary in the tax code to encourage development in particular areas.  I am not against the principle of such schemes, but their aim is to create investment.  We must ensure that people pay their fair share of tax.  That is what led me to introduce a measure in the budget that will restrict the amount of capital allowance that can be used by passive investors to reduce their tax liability.</P>
    <P>It has also come to my attention that even the large financial institutions in the city of Dublin, where many of these schemes operate, cannot compete with passive investors to buy some sites.  The figures for some of these transactions are enormous. Even two officials in the Department of Finance whom Deputy Coveney would know are not surprised as much as gobsmacked that some of the schemes will get through under transitional arrangements.  I had no idea of the amounts of money involved in some of these schemes.  Even with the transitional arrangements and cutting off these avoidance mechanisms or limiting them to £25,000, the downstream Exchequer cost for several years will be considerable.  One of the cornerstones of the budget was this restriction.  I have been pilloried by people on the left and the newly found left wing Opposition Deputy Michael Noonan.  I assume that in Government, Deputy Rabbitte discovered this new way of going on and has had an effect on Deputies John and Richard Bruton.</P>

      <P>I would not go that far, but if it is a virus the Deputy has always had it.  It is those who recently acquired the virus that I question. I do not question the Deputy or Deputy McDowell but I question others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to some of the restrictions in the transitional arrangements I have come across some tough cases which will not get through.  Some of these are at the smaller end of the scale.  If I were to backtrack on this change I would allow through a whole raft of capital allowance projects, involving about £1 billion.  Even if some projects <Col N="1011" /> have got through and others are in the pipeline for which hundreds of millions of pounds would be raised under this scheme, and even if I have sympathy with the cases put forward by Deputies I cannot back down in this case.  I had hoped Deputy McDowell, as he promised on Committee Stage, would bring forward an amendment in this area but he may have been advised against it.  If the Labour Party, after pillorying the Minister for Finance for producing a budget for the rich, brought forward the amendment he proposed I would have some serious things to say to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in making any exception is that it would open up the floodgates.  In any argument certain enterprise zones should be excluded but where does one draw the line?  Any general easing of the conditions for transitional arrangements would be costly to the Exchequer and would send out the wrong signal about easing a budget change affecting high earners.  It should be noted that in the case of two specific buildings in the Custom House docks area in 1996-7, which would not be covered by the Revenue survey, seven individual investors shared capital allowances of £19 million in one case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while only two investors shared capital allowances of £24 million in another case.  There are other projects in the pipeline, some of which will get through, and figures of that magnitude are being dealt with. There are other proposals in the pipeline which will not be able to get through for which we would be talking about up to £1 billion being allowed under this scheme.  Deputy Ardagh put the case well.  This tax scheme worked well and delivered projects but given the cost of building land now financial institutions cannot compete with individual investors and Deputy Rabbitte may be aware of that.  I have received a number of representations on this from Deputies, including Deputy Ferris.  I cannot accede to the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget restriction on capital allowances does not apply to the following categories of investors in buildings: an owner-occupier of the building, that is an individual carrying on the business in the building in which he claims the capital allowances; all corporate investors whether owner-occupiers or passive investors; individual passive investors who have enough rental income from all sources to absorb the capital allowances.  The restriction applies to passive investors who can still avail of the scheme but can take out only £25,000 to offset against their other <Col N="1012" /> income.  Some projects which have been caught now have corporate investors who are taking up the slack.  I am sure there are corporate investors out there who will gladly go along with their particular schemes.  People may have become frightened by their accountants and it may have become too easy to get a number of passive investors but that loophole has been closed off.  I cannot accede to this amendment as to do so would knock one of the foundation stones of the budget.</P>

The amendment recognises that what he is doing is legitimate as it is obvious the existing provisions were abused by high income earners.  The person concerned does not fall into that category. As commitments were given, the planning application was processed and approved before the announcement was made on budget day.  The amendment is tightly framed to avoid opening the floodgates.  I was not aware that there were millions of pounds available for hotel projects in Dublin.  That is not the case outside Dublin where it is much more difficult to develop such a project.

      <P>As the Minister will be aware, the previous Government commissioned a report from an interdepartmental working group, comprised of representatives from the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Environment and Local Government and Finance, on the conservation of our architectural heritage.  It recommended that the owners of listed buildings should be given incentives to maintain them in a good state of repair.  The Heritage Council, which was placed on a statutory basis by the previous Government, is unable to play a meaningful role because it is inadequately financed.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to amend section 19 of the l982 Finance Act under which the owners of listed buildings are granted tax relief to carry out essential repairs provided they are approved for tourism purposes by Bord Failte and open to the public.  I am not certain that the amendment would be adequate to tackle the problem.  Many hundreds of listed buildings of major architectural importance throughout the country have fallen into a state of disrepair and it is beyond the capacity of their owners to carry out essential repairs.  Within a short time many owners will have no choice but to abandon them completely. If the amendment is not acceptable, does the Minister have any proposals to tackle this problem?</P>
      <P>The amendment may not go far enough in terms of what is necessary.  Any initiative would be welcome.  Unlike the previous amendment, where the cost runs to hundreds of millions of pounds, I am sure the figure is small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, l997, <Col N="1014" /> which provides relief from tax in respect of the cost of repair, maintenance or restoration of approved buildings and gardens which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest to which reasonable access is afforded to the public.  Additional relief was provided in last year's Finance Act for expenditure up to £5,000 per annum on the repair, maintenance or restoration of approved buildings and gardens subject to certain conditions; the installation, maintenance or replacement of security alarm systems, and public liability insurance for approved buildings and gardens.  The Deputy is seeking to increase this figure to £20,000 per annum.  I do not consider there is a necessity for such an increase at a time of ever increasing demands for scarce resources and when there are budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>Since l982 there has been tax relief available to carry out repairs to and refurbish approved buildings. A case was made for the extension of tax relief for the installation of alarm systems.  This was granted in last year's Finance Act up to a figure of £5,000 per annum.  The Deputy is suggesting that this figure should be increased to £20,000 per annum.  Because of the system of self-assessment, the cost of the measure introduced in last year's Finance Act will not be known for some time.  If a strong case is made for an adjustment I will consider bringing forward a suitable amendment in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Taxes Consolidation Act, l997.  The provision was originally included in the l982 Finance Act.  The buildings in question must be approved by Bord Fáilte and open to the public before their owners qualify for relief.  The problem is that many of the buildings in question are in such a poor state of repair that Bord Fáilte could not consider approving them.  They are not fit for habitation. Hundreds of listed buildings of architectural significance throughout the country have fallen into a state of disrepair to such an extent that their owners will have no choice but to walk away. Incentives should be built into the tax code to enable them to write off some of the cost incurred in maintaining the buildings in question against their tax liability.  The interdepartmental report published by the previous Government contains a number of worthy recommendations to resolve this matter.  The Minister should consider that report with a view to bringing forward incentives for next year's Finance Bill.  It will be too late if we delay much longer.  Many of the buildings involved are in a bad state of disrepair and something must be done immediately.</P>

Bord Fáilte's remit relates only to public access to the building and it is the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands who approves the buildings.  I will consider the matters raised because the Deputy has a considerable interest in the issue.  If he has any further information he may forward it to me.

      <P>In page 73, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;39.&mdash;Section 659 of the Principal Act is hereby amended:</P>
      <P>(a) in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) by the insertion after &lsquo;trade of farming&rsquo; of &lsquo;, or incurs capital expenditure necessitated to comply with the structural standards of dairying facilities required under Directive 92/46/EEC, as amended&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(b) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3) The farming pollution capital allowances to be made in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of capital expenditure incurred in a chargeable period may, where a person so elects, be any amount not exceeding 100 per cent of that expenditure or £30,000 whichever is the lesser, in respect of one or more years during a writing-down period of 7 years&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(c) by the insertion of a new subsection after subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3A) In respect of activities which are the subject of an integrated pollution control licence under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, as respects the first year of the writing-down period referred to in subsection (2) where the capital expenditure was incurred on or after the 6th day of April, 1998 an amount equal to 50 per cent of that expenditure or £100,000 whichever is the lesser.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to agriculture and food, in particular to capital allowances for investment. The first part deals with capital expenditure necessarily incurred to ensure dairying facilities <Col N="1016" /> comply with an EU directive.  It is not a form of investment farmers make willy-nilly, rather it is a form of investment which they will be required to make in order to comply with the terms of the directive.  The dairy hygiene scheme, of which this is part, is beginning to have the effect of increasing the price of milk where the investments have been made and decreasing it where they have not. Consumers have an obvious interest in the matter because dairy hygiene standards are central to the quality of dairy products.  It would be reasonable to extend capital allowances in this case where farmers are investing to comply with a specific directive to improve the structural standards of their dairying facilities.</P>
    <P>The second element relates to farmyard pollution control capital expenditure.  We seek more flexibility in the writing down period of seven years.  The third element relates to an agricultural investment which is subject to the terms of an integrated pollution control licence under the Environmental Protection Agency.  This relates primarily to pig production.  There is a movement towards larger pig processing units which are necessitated by the competitive market.  These are the subject of tight control by the EPA and involve considerable investment expenditure.  We seek a targeted measure to facilitate that.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section in the Bill which will make various amendments to section 659 of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act, 1997, the section which provides for improved capital allowances for capital expenditure by farmers on certain buildings or structures where these are necessary for the control of pollution.  That section was introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, and provided for a special first year allowance of 50 per cent of expenditure up to an expenditure limit of £20,000.  This limit is being increased to £30,000 with effect from 6 April 1998 by section 38 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment has a number of objectives.  It will add a further class of capital expenditure to that which qualifies under section 659 for special allowances in relation to the control of pollution. This is capital expenditure incurred in order to comply with the structural standards of dairying facilities required under an EU directive mentioned in the amendment.  It must be pointed out that section 659 is targeted at assisting farmers who incur capital expenditure on the construction of buildings for necessary pollution control measures, as detailed in that section.  The proposal before us is not related to pollution control but is concerned with dairy hygiene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital expenditure on the construction of other farm buildings, including dairying facilities, already qualifies for capital allowances under section 658 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Under the terms of that section the costs of capital expenditure on farm buildings generally and other works, fences, roadways etc., can be written off over a seven year period at a rate of 15 per <Col N="1017" /> cent per annum for six years with the balance of 10 per cent claimable in the seventh year.  The pollution control allowances which are spread over an eight year period feature a front loading of relief up to a specific limit in the first year. These seek to target anti-pollution measures by farmers and are not intended to set a precedent whereby other categories of expenditure on buildings should be favourably treated.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment proposes a new method of granting capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on buildings constructed for pollution control purposes.  The scheme introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, operates on the basis of an enhanced first year allowance of 50 per cent of qualifying expenditure up to a limit of £20,000, which amount is being increased to £30,000 by section 38 of the Bill, with the balance being written off over a seven year period.  This was designed to meet the requests by farmers' representatives for a front loading of the capital allowances to enable them to benefit from the scheme soon after the expenditure has been incurred.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the amendment would appear to have the effect of allowing relief to be claimed in respect of the full amount of the expenditure on a free depreciation basis of up to £30,000 in any one year over a seven year writing down period. The arrangements introduced in the Finance Act, 1997, were intended to grant relief in a manner beneficial to farmers by means of the special first year treatment and to retain in so far as possible the integrity of the capital allowance regime applicable to farm buildings generally.  Thus, the facility for claiming an enhanced element of the relief was restricted to the first year of claim in relation to a particular outlay of capital expenditure. This in itself was a departure from the position which has come about in recent years whereby accelerated capital allowances have in general been greatly curtailed.</P>
    <P>The measure as structured at present and incorporating the 50 per cent enhancement of the first year special allowance is more than adequate for the purpose for which it was intended, namely, to encourage pollution control investment and to assist in a worthwhile way farmers who engage in such investment.</P>
    <P>The final part of the amendment seeks the provision of a second first year capital allowance for farmers to support investment by them in connection with activities which are the subject of an integrated pollution control licence under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and envisages an expenditure limit of up to £100,000 for the first year allowance.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, introduced integrated pollution control licensing by the EPA. The First Schedule to the Act sets out 13 classes of licensable activity only one of which is agricultural. All those appear to be covered by the amendment.</P>

      <P>Even if the amendment was targeted solely at intensive agricultural activities, such as pig and poultry farming, many of those in activities in the other categories might be in a position to press strongly for equally favourable treatment.</P>
      <P>Under the Partnership 2000 agreement, the Department of the Environment and Local Government entered into negotiations with the IFA on the cost and scope of integrated pollution control licensing for intensive agricultural activities and they are ongoing.  The scheme introduced last year, which enabled necessary pollution control expenditure to be written off over eight years with a special year one allowance of 50 per cent of expenditure up to a limit of £20,000, was to give effect to a commitment in the Partnership 2000 programme and applies when a farmer has in place a farm nutrient management plan drawn up by an agency or planner approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The increase in the payment from £20,000 to £30,000 represents a significant and generous increase in existing arrangements and should prove of real assistance to farmers incurring capital expenditure on necessary pollution control measures.  I do not propose to extend the scope of the existing arrangements to include expenditure outlays on a scale, and for the purposes proposed under a scheme, which go way beyond agricultural activities. In all these circumstances I must oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in defending his approach to tax reform, allowances, bands and rates argued that he had a democratic responsibility to stick by the mandate his party received in the last general election.  I remind him that the farming community, to an extent, gave a mandate to the Government on the manifesto before it with regard to the control of farmyard pollution. That scheme and the dairy hygiene grants were to be reintroduced and the installation aid scheme was guaranteed to last the lifetime of a Fianna Fáil Administration.  In regard to reopening the live export markets, it was said all that was required was a change of Minister and there would be no capping of headage payments. Those five promises were reneged on without the Minister for Agriculture and Food batting an eye-lid. Given that the Minister put great store on his democratic obligation arising from the election to adhere to proposals on tax bands and rates in terms of reforming the income tax system, he should accept the spirit of these amendments, which deal specifically with dairy hygiene, control of farmyard pollution and intensive pig production, to save the blushes of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Opposition Members do not have the benefit of the assistance of a parliamentary draftsman, but any Minister would have recognised the spirit of the amendments and if willing to lend a favourable ear to them could have drafted an acceptable and properly worded amendment.  I am extremely disappointed the <Col N="1019" /> Minister has taken this approach and I ask him to reconsider the amendment on the basis of the argument he used to advance and defend his position on reform of the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also disappointed with the Minister's approach because this amendment was tabled in response to the discontinuation of the dairy hygiene and farmyard pollution schemes.  I understand they were discontinued because EU funding may not be available.  The Government and Minister for Agriculture and Food gave a clear undertaking to renew those schemes as soon as they came to power, but they have not done that.</P>
      <P>There are three parts to the amendment.  I am prepared to forego the second part which proposes a small change to the farmyard pollution scheme, but the proposal on dairy hygiene is reasonable.  These are not tax effective holidays for farmers, but something they are mandatorily required to do and which small producers cannot do because they do not have the necessary money and are unable to borrow it.  If they were able to incentivise themselves in some way like this or the Minister offered them some means of doing so, it might be possible for them to get some of the required work done.</P>
      <P>I did not realise the last section of the amendment covered many other sectors, but I intended it to deal only with agriculture.  Those with pig and poultry units are being encouraged by the Department of Agriculture and Food and other advisers to group together to become larger and more cost effective.  Pig farming is a heavily pollutant industry and it requires significant capital investment, particularly to comply with all the EPA requirements.  It is not practical to say that £20,000 or £30,000 will go a significant way towards meeting the cost of building a large pig unit, which effectively is a factory.  I ask the Minister to consider the proposals on dairy hygiene in the last part of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Unlike other sectors of the economy which are generally doing well, agriculture is facing a tough time with the implementation of the Santer proposals. There is grave concern about their impact on Irish agriculture.  At a time when we have to consider modernising and investing in these areas, it would be appropriate for the Minister to give some assistance to farmers.</P>

      <P>The section of the 1997 Finance Act providing a limit of £20,000 for farmers was agreed in Partnership 2000 and in my generosity I increased that limit to £30,000 this year.  That is adequate and sufficient.  I stated in reply to Deputy Coveney's amendment that to go any further would impose a considerable cost on the Exchequer.  I accept what the Deputy said that pollution is something we must all guard against and I have no objection to using the tax system to incentivise farmers and others to reduce pollution <Col N="1020" /> levels.  I will consider the matter further before next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed mentioned the commitments in the programme for Government and in individual party manifestos leading up to the election.  I remind him that in my budget speech I increased the amount of money for headage in 1998 and I also allowed applicants in the pipeline for installation aid grants to be paid those grants in 1998. I was exceptionally generous in the budget to the farming organisations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 76, to delete lines 20 to 34.</P>
      <P>I did not particularly seek the role of advocating the case of the Minister's profession, but we did not get a chance to reach this amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Minister has proceeded to railroad this particular change through has created a great sense of grievance among members of the profession.  Since the introduction of self-assessment, accountants would argue that the Revenue should acknowledge their critical contribution to the efficiency of the system.  In their estimation, the change in filing dates occasioned by bringing the date forward from 31 January to 30 November could impact adversely on 250,000 self-employed taxpayers.  That is a very extensive number of people.  As I understand it, many sole traders already struggle to meet the 31 January deadline and clearly, in bringing the date forward, a significant new burden will be created for them.  I also understand there are particular categories and sectors, such as the tourism industry, which will be especially impacted on.</P>
      <P>The accountancy profession is amazed at the Minister's contention that the change is a simplification and should assist practitioners.  Practitioners themselves say that 87 per cent of the profession have stated the opposite in a survey and small practitioners will be placed in an impossible circumstance in terms of trying to comply with the 30 November date.  In any event, even if the idea of a calendar year has merit, which it may, the Minister should have consulted members of the profession about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it interesting that the Minister argued his opposition to making piecemeal changes both on Committee and Report Stages.  He said he wanted <Col N="1021" /> a sensible debate on a number of matters and would bring forward a comprehensive programme of reforms.  Therefore, he opposed amendments which seemed to the House to carry a good deal of merit.  In this particular case, the Minister has called for a sensible debate but is nonetheless proceeding with what effectively constitutes a piecemeal change that has caused some chagrin in the profession.  Will a full, open and fair impact assessment be carried out on the import of this decision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte, I would not automatically leap to press the case of the accountancy profession.  I am not convinced that, if this system does settle down, it will cause huge inconvenience to individual taxpayers.  I am, however, persuaded by accountants that they will in the first instance, and possibly in some continuing way, suffer considerable inconvenience in trying to meet the 30 November deadline.</P>
      <P>Why is the Revenue pressing for one date rather than two?  Will the Minister explain his public comments since the publication of the Finance Bill to the effect that he would like to see the tax year operate on a calendar year basis?  Is that merely musing of the kind we have become familiar with recently or is it a statement of firm intent?</P>

      <P>I would like to have more time to debate this issue as it is one about which I have a good deal of personal knowledge.  I have taken on board the comments of my colleagues in the accountancy profession.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to subject this section to a commencement order which would allow ample time between now and the end of November 1999 <Col N="1022" /> to put any necessary revenue changes in place.  It has long been my intention that the fiscal and tax years would operate on a calendar year basis. Over the coming 18 months or so, I intend to engage with the accountancy and taxation consultant professions on this issue.  I would have done so in regard to this Bill but was informed it would be difficult to do so in view of the year 2000 problems.  An impact assessment will be carried out.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to note that I am withdrawing amendment No. 38, in my name, which concerns a minor drafting correction.  I am informed there is a minor drafting error in amendment 48l at the bottom of page 2 of the first additional list of amendments.  I ask Deputies to treat the amendment as if the comma, which appears after the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; in the definition of underlying tax, appeared before it.  A minor error has also been found in two places in the new renewal provisions. In page 119, line 33 and page 152, line 13, the reference to &ldquo;subsection (3)&rdquo; should read &ldquo;subsection (4)&rdquo;.  These were discovered too late for inclusion in the Report Stage amendments and if the House agrees, it is recommended that the correct references be now inserted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Yesterday the Minister resorted to the same type of irresponsible headline hysteria which has characterised much of the debate on the refugee issue.  Unfortunately some of the newspapers bought his propaganda lock, stock and barrel, with banner headlines that refugees cost £1 million per week and possibly as much as £200 million or £250 million per annum. This is off the top of the head stuff which does serious damage to the merits and arguments surrounding this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not know the true figure but the Minister has once again seriously exaggerated the scale and cost.  Yesterday Deputy Gerry Reynolds tabled a question to the Minister for Health and Children on the amount of financial resources provided to the Eastern Health Board for the provision of temporary accommodation for homeless persons and refugees for each of the years from 1994 to 1997.  The health board has primary responsibility for this matter.  The figure in 1994 was £1.5 million, while it was £6.813 million in 1997.  This is a far cry from £1 million per week or £250 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> The blame for the figure, whatever it is, lies firmly with the Minister whose lethargy and indecision has contributed significantly to the backlog of refugee applications.  If he had honoured his commitment to implement the Refugee Act, or its main portions, then the scale of the problem and the cost need not have arisen.  If a proper, independent system had been put in place the backlog could have been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were recently reported as saying that the millions of pounds spent in maintaining asylum seekers might be better spent on development programmes in their own countries. Is it now official Government policy that black babies are all right as long as they stay in their own countries?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: If the Minister and his Department had the foresight to see these people as a resource rather than a liability then the scale of the problem and the financial burden would have been minimised.  The Minister has a glorious opportunity to eliminate the cost on which he placed major emphasis and to wipe the slate clean by accepting this Bill.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of what is involved, acceptance of the Bill is the obvious solution.  It would give the Government breathing space to implement the main provisions of the Refugee Act or to introduce new legislation.  It would enable a fresh start to be made in dealing with new applicants, free up resources within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and allow the thousands of asylum seekers locked in inner city ghettos to disperse and relocate in other areas. We would all benefit from their ethnic presence in our areas.  I say this as someone from a small community in the west which has a considerable cross section of people from Pakistan, Libya, Morocco and Syria.  It would enable applicants to take up employment and, therefore, reduce social welfare and health costs.  It would also allow the State's economy to benefit from the academic, linguistic and manual skills many of these immigrants possess.  Not least, it would redeem the image of Ireland and redress the damage done to our international reputation by the shoddy manner in which this issue has been handled.  It would salvage a situation which has been badly handled administratively and on humanitarian grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In times gone by there was a substantial Jewish community in the inner city area of Dublin, particularly around the South Circular Road.  I represent Jewish people, who have a good sense of humour, and I hope I do not offend them when I say that in the past this area was known as Little Jerusalem.  While I hope it will not offend any of my Moslem constituents, Little Jerusalem was christened Little Mecca when Moslems moved into the area which Jewish people formerly lived in.  The Jewish people <Col N="1026" /> moved out to Rathgar, Terenure and other parts of the city where they are constituents of mine. They have made a great input to the civic and civil life of this country.  The presence of the Jewish and Moslem communities has not created any problems because they integrated into the community at large.  The presence of Bosnian and Vietnamese refugees has not created any problem either because it was done on a planned basis.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging there is a problem, this is because preparation is not being made on a planned basis to deal with the immigrant issue. We have been used to sending emigrants abroad. Some 800,000 people of Irish birth live in Britain. According to the last census, 11.5 per cent of the population of greater London are either Irish or of Irish birth.  We are used to Irish people being treated as immigrants abroad.  We, above all, should be generous in our treatment of immigrants.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I suggest the Government should appoint a Minister or Minister of State with overall responsibility for immigrant issues. That would cover not just visa questions but also social welfare, housing, education, integration and intercommunal relations.  It is not fair to the refugee or immigrant community, nor is it fair to the indigenous community, that this situation should be left to fester without a planned, compassionate and co-ordinated response.  People's reactions are based on fear, but if we have a co-ordinated plan which is fair and just &mdash; both for the local community and the new community which has joined us &mdash; as well as being well thought out, co-ordinated and balanced, people will not allow their judgments to be coloured by fear.  We need a specific Minister to co-ordinate a compassionate Government response to immigrant issues, including intercommunal relations.  If for no other reason, it should be done so that the House can question the Minister on Government policy as well as putting proposals forward to head off communal strife.  There are people who would be only too happy to build up such strife but we can nip it in the bud if we have a Minister and a co-ordinated plan and if we concentrate on dealing with this issue on a cross-party basis.</P>

      <P>For a party which has such an aversion to amnesties I am surprised that Democratic Left should even contemplate introducing this Bill.  It is significant to note that this method of addressing the issue of refugees, immigration and asylum seekers did not cross their minds when the party was in Government.  In fact, I note that the previous Government, at its last meeting, <Col N="1027" /> decided to introduce passport checks on people travelling from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>On taking office, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, met the UNHCR representative and a commitment was given that the UNHCR would assist in every possible way in dealing with the backlog of applications for asylum.  Consultations took place with the UNHCR to improve arrangements for dealing with applications, to replace those in place since 1985.  The new arrangements have been in place since last December.  They include the availability of legal advice for asylum seekers who wish to obtain it.</P>
      <P>In researching this matter, I took the opportunity of reading the 1994 report of the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees.  I will quote three short extracts to contextualise my comments.</P>
      <P>On page 5, paragraph 17, under the heading &ldquo;Strategies for Prevention and Solutions&rdquo;, the report states:</P>
      <P>It is in the areas of prevention and solutions, and thus primarily with relation to the countries of origin of refugees or potential refugees, that the need and the possibility for new initiatives have been recognised.  Serious violations of human rights are a major factor causing refugees to flee their homes and also a major obstacle to the solution of refugee problems through voluntary repatriation.  Safeguarding human rights is one of the best ways to prevent displacement and to permit safe return.</P>
      <P>On page 7, paragraph 23 of the report states:</P>
      <P>In the industrialised world, mixed movements of refugees and migrants present special protection problems, including overloading asylum procedures, both for Governments and for UNHCR.</P>
      <P>On page 8, paragraph 27 of the report states:</P>
      <P>The disturbing trend of intolerance and violence against foreigners including asylum seekers and refugees, by segments of the population in a number of countries continued to be observed in the reporting period, [which, I gather, is 1994] despite preventive and deterrent measures taken by the authorities to improve their security and prosecute the perpetrators of violent acts.</P>
      <P>The production of this Bill by Deputy McManus provides us with a timely opportunity to address the issues related to refugees and asylum seekers as well as reflecting in a calm and rational manner on what is, for Ireland, the relatively new phenomenon of immigration.  For many centuries our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters sought the not always welcoming shores of our nearest neighbours, the United Kingdom, in addition to what was then the remoteness of the United States, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times they have been dispersed to the <Col N="1028" /> African and American continents and deep into Asia.  Few were emigrants by choice and they worked hard in often difficult and inhospitable circumstances to make a living in their new found homes.  Many made a significant impact in their adopted homes.  I do not propose to recite the prominent names but, as we head towards St. Patrick's Day, I want to pay tribute to the unsung daughters and sons of the Irish diaspora all over the world for the contribution they have made to their host countries.</P>
    <P>As we enjoy relative wealth and prosperity we are clearly an attractive destination for immigrants from other countries who wish, for a range of very good reasons, to make their homes here.  I salute the 50,000 non-Irish people who are legally resident here.  I pay tribute to them for their contribution to the development of Irish society.  We can only benefit from their talents and expertise.</P>
    <P>Our record in accepting refugees from areas of conflict throughout the world has been a good one.  We responded &mdash; perhaps somewhat inadequately and hesitantly &mdash; to refugees from Hungary. Our response in accepting victims of the Vietnamese conflict was generous for its time.  At a time when our own resources were limited, we tried to ensure our education system and our health and social welfare policies responded to the needs of the Vietnamese community.  I pay tribute to the many voluntary groups who worked with these refugees and I acknowledge the assistance given by such statutory bodies as the City of Dublin VEC in helping the Vietnamese community to integrate into Irish society.</P>
    <P>Our response to the Bosnian conflict reflected a new growth of maturity in our approach to refugees and to the assimilation of the victims of political oppression and terrorist warfare.  A great number of the original tranche of Bosnian refugees have now put down roots here.  They have progressed into employment as well as availing of incentives to purchase their own homes and participate fully in the life of their adopted community.</P>
    <P>A new phenomenon is presenting itself, however.  At a time when conflict levels are at an historic low and when the number of claims for refugee status is falling in the rest of the EU, the Irish rate shows a major increase.  Many of the newer immigrants seem to have evaded immigration controls.  They seem to give a name and claim a country of origin but give no other information. These illegal immigrants who arrive here willingly or otherwise, besmirch the name of genuine refugees who deserve protection and support.  The proposed amnesty is too blunt an instrument.  It adopts an indiscriminate approach to people's lives.  Each person who comes here deserves to be assessed on an individual basis.  I oppose this measure, therefore, as anti-humanitarian.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we develop a coherent immigration policy which should take account of the capacity of the country to assimilate new immigrants bearing in mind the expertise they <Col N="1029" /> bring with them, available employment opportunities and the capacity of the State to provide for the housing, education, health and other needs of immigrants.  There must be a distribution of immigrants throughout the country in an orderly fashion.  It is also important to signal to those who engage in the illegal trafficking of immigrants that they will face the full rigour of the law for their wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>Last December this House unanimously passed a motion condemning sentiments and manifestations of racism as inimical to respect for the dignity of all human beings and deploring hostile sentiments or acts directed against those from other countries seeking refuge in this State.  I reiterate that condemnation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McManus on bringing this Private Members' Bill before the House.  I do not agree with all aspects or the primary purpose of the Asylum Seekers (Regularisation of Status)(No. 2) Bill.  In essence, the Bill concerns the 4,000 refugee applications currently outstanding.  This proposal is one way of dealing with those applications and the current unacceptable logjam in the processing of applications for refugee status, but I do not support it.</P>
      <P>The biggest weakness in the Bill is that it does not make the distinction between a refugee and an illegal immigrant.  The UNHCR made its views known on this, namely, that a clear distinction should be made between the two and that those who do not qualify should not be allowed to remain in this country.  I have expressed that view in the past.</P>
      <P>I hope this debate will have a beneficial impact on the current unacceptable position.  Why are 4,000 applications outstanding?  Over what period of time were those applications made?  Who is responsible for them and is there collective responsibility?  According to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, 5,264 asylum seekers made an application for refugee status in the period from 1 January 1994 to October 1997. Of those who applied, less than 5 per cent were recognised, less than 10 per cent were refused and 70 per cent of cases were left outstanding.  That is an appalling record.  The Government responsible at that time was the rainbow coalition made up of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.  The record shows that Government failed in its duty to asylum seekers, among many other failures.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the House during the debate last evening with regard to the commencement of recruitment of additional staff in his Department to process asylum seekers' applications for refugee status.  I have a proposal in that regard which I will refer to later.  I note, regrettably, that there were delays in recruitment up to 27 February 1998, that only 19 additional staff have been recruited to date, that the provision of legal aid to applicants is not satisfactory and that, more importantly, a time schedule has not been put in place to address such issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I issued a press release on 24 November last following an Eastern Health Board special meeting. The press release had a cover sheet and a five page Eastern Health Board report which indicated the position regarding asylum seekers as well as some early warning signals.  Following the press release I received some unfair comments and terms were attributed to me by the media and others which were not factual.  The EHB report and recent statistics indicate that Ireland is the only European country experiencing a continuous increase in those seeking refugee status.  Other associated issues which were referred to in that report have been proved to be factual.</P>
    <P>I also indicated at the time that genuine asylum seekers were experiencing unacceptable delays in having their cases processed.  I indicated that the cost of delays in processing applications had escalated out of control which was a waste of scarce resources and a misuse of taxpayers' funds.  I also indicated that I was fully supportive of providing refuge for the many genuine refugees but that we should not be expected to finance the long-term stay of undeserving applicants who have no prospect or right to be admitted to this country.  I called on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speed up the processing of applications and to put in place a satisfactory mechanism which would be in keeping with the UNHCR guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied my efforts helped to focus attention on this issue and some measures were addressed.  I understand the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, put new structures and procedures in place concerning the independent assessment of appeals, reached agreement with the UNHCR on such assessment, additional staff requirements were identified and an agreed training programme, with the assistance of the UNHCR, was put in place.  An interdepartmental group was also set up made up of senior civil servants from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the comments from Deputy McManus regarding this expert group.  As a former Minister of State I thought she would have more recognition of the work of such a group.  This group has already identified two issues.  First, changes should be made to the Refugee Act to align Irish policy more closely with that of our EU partners and, second, penalties should be introduced into our law for those involved in trafficking illegal immigrants to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government stands over the motion passed in this House last December condemning racism in all its manifestations.  I object to the offensive remarks made about me on this subject. Despite the attempts by some Members of this House who made off the wall comments, they did not succeed.  Apart from expressing my disappointment <Col N="1031" /> with irresponsible Members who tell untruths and avail of privilege, I do not intend to embarrass any Member.  A number of them know of the abuse to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I am deeply conscious of the duties and responsibilities placed on me as a public representative and as a member of Fianna Fáil with its great traditions.  Fianna Fáil is a democratic republican party born out of a revolutionary tradition. We have a proven and proud record on all humanitarian issues.  Those of us in Fianna Fáil will continue to play an effective role in bringing an end to violations of human rights whenever necessary.</P>
    <P>In regard to the current logjam, special priority focus is required.  I ask the Minister to seek Government approval to put in place a rapid, compassionate response unit to adequately address all relevant issues, particularly applications for refugee status, and a satisfactory time schedule that would be adhered to.  The challenge is to identify as quickly as possible genuine refugees deserving protection and ensure that their applications are dealt with speedily and fairly.</P>
    <P>Last November I indicated that current records showed a considerable proportion of applicants are found not to be deserving of asylum.  This point was confirmed last night when the Minister indicated that the reality, in line with international experience, is that only 10 per cent of applicants will, following examination, be found to be genuine refugees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister outlining his policy in relation to genuine refugees and illegal immigrants. We should combine our efforts to ensure that genuine applicants are accommodated and that those abusing the system are rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill and I welcome the fact the Minister indicated his opposition to it.  The kernel of the Bill can be found in section 2 which states that a person who, before 1 January 1998, had made or was entitled to make an application seeking the status of a refugee in the State, shall be permitted by the Minister to remain and reside in the State and shall be called an admitted asylum seeker.  The Bill equates an admitted asylum seeker with a refugee under the Refugee Act.  It provides an amnesty for entrants who arrived here before 1 January 1998 and who applied for refugee status. In effect, any person who arrived here before 1 January 1998, gave a name and country of origin but gave no other information can be treated as a refugee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that 98 per cent of asylum seekers evade immigration controls and claim to be unaware of how they arrived in Ireland.  It is extraordinary that any responsible political party would put forward as a serious political proposal the idea that a group of people, 98 per cent of whom have evaded immigration controls and claimed to be unaware of how they arrived in Ireland, should automatically, without <Col N="1032" /> further investigation, be given the rights of a refugee under the refugee legislation.</P>
    <P>There have been unfortunate delays in dealing with applications for refugee status and those applications must be dealt with.  There is no point rehearsing the matter; the delay caused by the High Court proceedings and the huge volume of cases that arose has been rehashed many times at Question Time and in the Minister's speech.  I come back to that simple fact disclosed by the Minister.  This is not a case of people arriving at ports of embarkation and claiming they are fleeing from persecution.  It is a group of people, the vast majority of whom have consciously evaded immigration controls, and we should not enact legislation that retrospectively solves that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's comrades on the left in other parts of Europe have suffered great blows on this issue.  The Minister has the official documentation at his disposal and his figures are correct.</P>
      <P>It has not been mentioned in the debate, and it is not an urban legend &mdash; it is well known to the citizens &mdash; that Ireland is advertised on the Internet as a desirable location from a social security point of view.  It is also advertised on the Internet &mdash; I do not fault Deputy McManus or Democratic Left for this because the ball was initially hopped by the Tánaiste &mdash; that Ireland may offer an amnesty to people coming here.  It is widely known that there is a good deal of traffic in the smuggling of persons into the State, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to introduce legislation to deal with that problem.  A large number of persons are being brought into this State in complete defiance of immigration controls.</P>
      <P>The argument will be made immediately that I am guilty of racism in expressing this point of view but if we are to maintain public confidence in our immigration procedures they must be seen to be fair, balanced, working and based on rational principles.  The position that has developed to date is not fair or balanced and it is not based on rational principles.  To introduce an amnesty in this area will not base the system on a rational principle.  That is the problem we face.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined that he has recruited additional staff to dispose of outstanding applications for refugee status.  We are confusing two distinct issues here &mdash; refugee status and immigration policy.  In regard to refugee status, the Minister stated that in his view &mdash; it seems to be the view of most commentators &mdash; a minority of applications relate to genuine refugees.  Nobody disputes that refugees should be admitted and accepted here and accorded the status to which they are entitled under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue we must address is immigration policy.  For the first time in modern Irish history <Col N="1033" /> there is substantial net immigration.  We need to develop a rational immigration policy where definite quotas of people will be welcome from other lands, if necessary, outside the European Union, and given an opportunity to work, set up businesses and advance themselves here.  If such a system was established there would be public confidence in the immigration procedures.  There is, however, growing lack of public confidence in the immigration procedures.  There are the seeds of great political peril in this regard.  The comrades of Democratic Left in many continental countries have seen the damage it has done in their constituencies, with the growth of extreme right wing parties, xenophobic parties and anti-democratic forces.  We have seen that in France and other continental countries.  We have an opportunity to learn from the mistakes made in other countries and to address this problem in a rational way.</P>
    <P>Our work visa arrangements administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment are too restrictive.  We should consider giving an opportunity to genuine immigrants to live and work here.  The present arrangement is not working. There appears to be a consciousness abroad that Ireland can be a haven for economic migrants.  There is public perception that there is abuse of the welfare system.  Alas, urban legends are spreading and every Deputy hears at advice centres that social housing is not allocated to the local population because priority is accorded to immigrants.  Unless the issue is addressed in a radical way along the lines I have suggested, that will create an ugly public mood.</P>
    <P>I understand the sentiment that motivated this measure.  It has had the benefit of bringing the issue before the House, but I am not satisfied that the introduction of an amnesty will resolve the problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill.  I compliment Democratic Left for introducing it and I compliment Fine Gael for giving what is a valuable resource for an Opposition party, Private Members' time, so that the Bill could be taken.</P>
      <P>I listened with great care to what was said last evening and again this evening.  We are tested by what will happen in terms of whether the Bill will be passed.  I wish to respond to a point made by Deputy Brian Lenihan who suggested that a distinction should be drawn between refugee policy and immigration policy.  The problem is that failure in one area is being used to create fear in the other.  This Bill would create a space in which a thoughtful, proper, internationally responsible refugee policy could be constructed for the introduction into Irish society of those who come from abroad.  If this Bill is defeated, the same Department that is responsible for both matters will continue with the minor changes made and announced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan said that there is a growing lack of confidence in Ireland's immigration policy. However there is widespread lack of confidence <Col N="1034" /> in the ability of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to exercise its responsibilities in the area of refugees and immigrants. I do not say this easily.  I worked for a long time on migration and I taught the only course on the island of Ireland on the sociology of migration for a number of years at University College, Galway.  I also worked with the Committee for the Defence of Refugees and Emigrants in Basel.  I have travelled and worked with different voluntary organisations which dealt with the welfare of migrants in different parts of the world, including Somalia, North Africa, Central America and Turkey.  I have first hand knowledge of the trauma and stress of both refugees and migrants.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the House, I propose to share my time with Deputy Enright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That experience has taught me a number of things.  I hoped that as this Bill was introduced there would be less recrimination about what happened and more commitment to what must now happen if we are to clear the decks and introduce procedures which are acceptable nationally and internationally.  Obviously that will not be the case.  This will fill many people with despair.</P>
      <P>My professional training, as somebody who dealt for nearly 20 years with the sociology of migration, leads me to question every figure in the Minister's speech.  I challenge the basis for these calculations.  For example, the estimated cost of the suggested immigrant flow is based on an assumption that all will automatically seek welfare and none will work.  It is an assumption of a negative contribution on the basis that immigrants will not seek employment.  I am not defeated in this by the statement that it is a condition they cannot work because one would simply argue in circles about why people do not work, etc.</P>
      <P>I challenge their assumptions on the international statistics on migration.  I also challenge them to introduce the methodology by which the calculation was made both in terms of the numbers and particularly the projected and imputed costs.  They have no basis in the literature.  Furthermore, it is irresponsible to put such figures into public currency to create, perhaps unintentionally, an atmosphere of fear and to make matters difficult.</P>
      <P>In this Dáil and previous ones I received letters of a racist kind, particularly when former Deputy Moosajee Bhamjee was a colleague in this House. I forwarded some of them to the Minister and I received a courteous response to the effect that they were being dealt with.  They were encouraging racist attacks on members of the Chinese community, among others, in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been disgraceful racist slogans in different parts of Ireland, but we should get our <Col N="1035" /> heads clear on this.  There is a convoluted reasoning that we must not upset people as they may become racist.  It is important to condemn racism out of hand for what it is and to condemn those who inflame the fear which produces racism.</P>
    <P>We also need to straighten our logic.  I listened with great care to what Deputy Mitchell said about little Jerusalem in Dublin.  There were many little Irelands in Britain in the 19th century. The distinguished writer, Dr. Frances Finnegan, described the Irish in York in her book <i>Poverty and Prejudice</i> published by Cork University Press.  They were just one example of a little Ireland.  According to Professor Gearóid Ó Tuathaigh's seminal work on attitudes of the British towards Irish immigration in the 19th century, they were regarded by the Britain media as the carriers of disease and as being overwhelmingly involved in crime, and they were mocked because they spoke the Irish language.  When we think of the situation which greeted Irish speaking emigrants to the US in the 19th century, can we now visit the same difficulties and disabilities on people which faced our citizens when they went in floods to north America?</P>
    <P>It is useful to think about the way that it happened. Before the Famine there was seasonal migration, with people coming and going from Britain.  What happened at the time of the Famine? The literature from Liverpool is very clear on this.  Faced with famine, the loss of one million people and another million emigrating, all the people did not flood to the US; they flooded to Liverpool and places like it.  They came in droves. To people who had been accepted in places like York and Liverpool came a huge tide of relatives and neighbours who were castigated, regarded as the carriers of disease and made unwelcome.</P>
    <P>That is our experience.  I do not want to dwell too much on it except to say that there is such a thing as the ethics of memory.  As we speak of the Celtic tiger, which is an offensive and ridiculous term, and how we have become so affluent, we could easily invent a past for ourselves which did not include the fact that Ireland, of all the EU countries, was sending its people abroad regularly for a very long time.  There were 55,000 emigrants in 1955.</P>
    <P>I remember being in England in that period and writing a letter to the <i>Evening Standard</i>&mdash; the first letter I wrote to a newspaper &mdash; about a racist attack on the Irish in Britain.  This is 1998 and the Bill before us simply makes provision, irrespective of what happened in the past, to clean the slate and make a decision on those cases, which have been neglected, badly handled and badly administered, which will create a space in which good and new agreed procedures can be put in place to handle the question of refugees. That proposal will be turned down.  Instead, we will continue with only a minor amendment to the existing situation.</P>
    <P>I want next to make a statement about the fundamental sovereignty of this House and the <Col N="1036" /> Oireachtas.  The 1996 Act is the law of the land. It is more than a gross impertinence to establish an interdepartmental committee to work on how to implement the 1996 Act.  If the 1996 Act is flawed, the Minister's honourable course of action would be to come into the House and state that he will repeal it because he has no intention of implementing it.  If it cannot be implemented, he should table amending legislation and give us, who put in place the Act, the right to change it. Instead, it is being killed by stealth because there is no construction from the Minister's speech other than that he does not intend to implement it.  The Democratic Left Bill in the name of Deputy McManus enables the 1996 Act to come into effect and it is outrageous that the Oireachtas can be treated in this manner.</P>
    <P>Not a single person who has dealt with migration or immigrants has confidence in the Department.  The reason the Bill is being killed by stealth is of course that it is accepted by those who want to help, that the ideal way of administering this particular problem is to establish a body with statutory autonomy separate from the Department which has made such a mess of it for such a very long time.</P>
    <P>I could discuss the detail of Deputy McManus' Bill but she has already done so competently.  I could refer to the changes that have taken place with regard to the proposals on the existing legislation and those which were introduced in the context of the autonomy of the appeals process. Last evening we were informed in detail that when an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform makes a decision the appeal will go to another official.  That is outrageous. The autonomy of the decision-making and appeals processes is crucial.</P>
    <P>There is a consistent and, though not malevolent, unfortunate confusion of the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Because that individual must concentrate in terms of his mandate on the basic fact of refugee rights, he stated, as Deputy Carey correctly indicated, in the 1994 report that anyone interested in refugees knows that one must address the source of the abuse in the home country which would remove the reason for refugees in the first instance.  The United Nations High Commissioner defines the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; several times in the 1994 report and states that refugees can be distinguished from other forms of migrants.  However, we are faced in this debate with the absurd situation where the abuse of refugees and the neglect in processing their cases is being used as a hammer against economic refugees. That is simply outrageous.</P>
    <P>I could spend the remainder of the evening discussing what should be our appropriate attitude towards economic refugees and who we should allow enter millennial Ireland.  God help us.  I was moved by Deputy McManus' statement last night about the background to the refugees whose cases have been neglected.  These people come from a background of torture, displacement and <Col N="1037" /> destroyed lives.  Many of them cannot make their cases freely for fear of retribution on the families they left behind.  Today I was informed about the case of an Irishman married to an Englishwoman who adopted a two year old baby in Somalia.  The baby is in the queue awaiting validation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to whether it can travel with its parents.  That kind of neglect is appalling.  There is no point in stating that additional staff are being allocated to operate the system.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>In volume 457 of the Dáil debates, which deals with the period October to November 1995, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in his previous incarnation, referred to Amnesty International and stated:</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware that Amnesty International published a document setting out its objections to certain aspects of the Bill while generally welcoming it.  It also states that the category of manifestly unfounded applications is open to potential serious abuse and grave injustices.  Amnesty International states that it cannot understand why all claims for asylum cannot be dealt with under the ordinary system. It also states that the experience abroad has shown that the use of fast-track procedures save neither time nor money.  I totally agree with the observations and criticisms of Amnesty International in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Deputy continued with the following rhetoric:</P>
    <P>What the Bill will provide will be dictated by the manner in which we enact it.  We should use this opportunity to set up a reasoned and sensitive refugee policy which will be effective and fair.  We should view it not in isolation but in the context of Ireland's role in the new Europe and independently as a country which is probably more aware of and sensitive to the needs and problems of refugees.</P>
    <P>Would that we were more aware and sensitive of their needs, given that we have the fifth lowest rate of intake in the European Union.</P>
    <P>A sense of puzzlement emerged from the Minister's sensational contribution last evening in respect of all the people who want to come to Ireland.  It appears there will be another flood of refugees now that people have access to the Internet. One can imagine people across the globe accessing Ireland on the Internet.  We will not be able to deal with the flood of refugees that will sweep over us.  What patent nonsense.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>What we have experienced in recent times, however, is something quite new.  It is a source of puzzlement to many people that at a time when there are no conflicts taking place near our borders of the kind that usually generate refugee movement, when we have no colonial links with countries in which political turmoil is taking place ..</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Does this mean Ireland should have been a colonising power in order for us to now accept refugees?  Does it mean there should be conflicts taking place outside our borders before we adopt a responsible policy?  The Minister's statement is so morally bankrupt it is appalling.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the decision of the previous Government.  As a Minister I expressed my views in the same manner as I have during this debate.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might be informed by his officials about the advice they gave his predecessor, whether the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees was consulted and that what was proposed was at that individual's request.  That is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I am willing to state we were wrong provided we are willing to get it right this evening.  What we are voting on this evening is Deputy McManus' Bill which will create a space into which proper procedures can be placed.  If the Bill is defeated, not only will the legislation fall but the process of undermining the 1996 Act will continue, the interdepartmental committee will have won and the Oireachtas will have lost.  More importantly, those who would have been affected by the legislation will have lost.  We will be responsible for saying to the people involved with the caring organisations &mdash; whom I support and who produced the charter on asylum rights in Ireland &mdash; that we recognise their interest but that they do not really understand the problem.</P>
    <P>The time has come to restore the integrity of the 1996 Act and enable it to come into being by accepting Deputy McManus' Bill.  By making the necessary adjustments to procedures we can then deal properly with the issue of migrancy.  It is also time to end the ambivalence and stop the nonsense of encouraging a war among the poor.  We have reached a sad stage if we state that housing applicants and the unemployed are in competition with migrants.  If that is the case, the answer is to build more houses and use our successful economy to create further opportunities.</P>
    <P>We are showing a version of ourselves that is depressing and mean.  I imagine there is more decency in ordinary Irish people who, as already stated, have the ethic of memory.  Most families in Ireland have relatives who went abroad &mdash; half the members of my family did so &mdash; and they want to see the emergence of a kind of dignity and solidarity. I do not care who it displeases but it must be stated that there are things we should give away, things we should share and it should cost us something to do so.  In this way we can honour decent principles, be faithful to our history and treat people with dignity.  It is offensive that instead of responding to the will of the Dáil we have lumped the problem into an administrative morass where it is being badly neglected.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest that the Cooney case is the reason the Act cannot be implemented. Where is the evidence for this?  Will the Government inform us that it sought an early hearing of <Col N="1039" /> that case or lodged a defence?  It is a weak straw, a tool, an instrument in the demolition of the 1996 Act.  It is time we realised we have obligations under international law.  I tried to write notes, but it was so depressing that I stopped.  We agreed the United Nations Convention of l951 in November l956 and we became a party to the 1967 Protocol in November 1968.  We have had 30 years of comprehensive neglect.  It does not matter who is responsible; that is what is at stake. I looked at the Second Stage speeches.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, made an eloquent speech &mdash; I am sure she will be voting with us this evening.  In the Official Report, 19 October 1995, Vol.  457.  col.  732, she stated:</P>
    <P>I welcome also the composition of the Refugee Appeal Board.  The original Bill proposed the establishment of a three person tribunal on which State interests were vastly over-represented. The new appeal board allows for the appointment to the five person body of two independent persons.</P>
    <P>We will see this evening where Deputy O'Donnell stands.  All through that debate there were continual references to the 150th anniversary of the Famine, that we have only just got over apparently, reading what was said in l995.  Here now we are tested.  I have dealt with the issue of refugees because this Bill will clear a space in which we can begin to have proper and just procedures in place.  There is another sense to it in the context of all the quotations we heard in the Minister's speech about the flood that is coming at us all over Europe.  The Minister said that it was a matter of concern in Europe.  Does this mean that Fortress Europe, that took in Filipino labour in Brussels to work for bureaucrats until cheap Eastern European labour became available and the Filipinos could be sent home, is to be a set of people at the trough within a fortress in which no one is welcome and that we, having sent our people abroad so consistently, instead of standing up to that, are going to give a lead in that thinking?  That does not represent me.  It does not represent most of those who will vote for this Bill.  That is what it is all about.  It is not about recrimination.  The Minister can stand up and say that we were wrong, and we can accept that, and he can say that he accepts the Second Stage of the Bill and make such changes as he wants to it, but he should not ask us not just to defeat this Bill but to undermine the l996 Bill that we have already passed into law.</P>

      <P>If this Bill had come before the House of Commons when Enoch Powell was a member of that House, I am quite certain he would have spoken with vehemence against it. Enoch Powell is now deceased and his policies should be abandoned.  In fairness to the people of Britain, they showed tolerance and generosity <Col N="1040" /> towards people.  That was right and as it should be.</P>
      <P>Our attitude towards asylum seekers and refugees saddens me.  There are many people across Ireland who are against refugees being allowed in.  Many years ago, when the lives of the boat people were at risk, I asked that they be given shelter and refuge in Ireland.  I got much correspondence from people congratulating me on the view I expressed, but I got a lot of hate mail as well.  There are people who are selfish and greedy and who are not prepared to share.  Overall what is right and correct is contained in this Bill and we should be very careful about rejecting it.  I congratulate Deputy McManus and her party on presenting this Bill.  It is an excellent Bill and worthy of the support of everybody in this House.  I am amazed that the Government will not allow it to pass Second Stage at least, and then make changes which I am sure would be met with generosity on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>We are speaking about roughly 4,000 asylum seekers, but newspaper reports represent it as hundreds of thousands of people.  Given the attitude at official level, I would be tempted to warn those people not to allow themselves to be caught in a trap here.  I have no axe to grind with the Independent Newspaper Group, but I was saddened by the front page article in this morning's <i>Irish Independent.</i> It will affect the views of many people across the country who feel they will be caught for extra taxes and they will be prejudiced. It is sad that that should happen.  I cannot understand how the Minister arrived at the figures mentioned in that article.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins outlined the fact that roughly £6,800,000 was allocated by the Eastern Health Board in l997.  Refugees are prohibited by law from working and they are entitled to be paid about £70 a week in unemployment assistance. That comes to about £13 million.  Taken together, those figures amount to about £22 million.  Therefore, the figure in that paper is totally off the wall and I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins that the Minister should be asked to justify his figures.</P>
      <P>It saddens me that we are talking about money when people's lives are at risk, when people will be put out of Ireland and sent to places where their lives may be placed in jeopardy.  That is the harsh reality.  We are a country that exported millions of people over the years.  Deputy Higgins spoke about the l950s.  The majority of the people I went to national school with left Ireland.  Their fathers could not get work here and they themselves, when they came to 15 years of age, left Ireland also to get work.  They met with intolerance in Britain, but many of them succeeded.  I cringe when I see people of a different ethnic origin arriving at Dublin Airport and being taken out of the queue and brought aside to have their credentials checked because of the colour of their skin.  It is a sad day for Ireland, and the sooner we show some spark of generosity the better.  I believe the vast majority of Irish people believe this Bill is correct.</P>

      <P>Let me refer to a point made last night by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, which seems to have been ignored by speakers in support of the Bill. There is a clear distinction between a genuine refugee and a person who has simply managed to evade immigration controls.  International experience is that, at most, 10 per cent of asylum applicants are found to be genuine refugees.</P>

      <P>What is being suggested is an all-encompassing measure under which 90 per cent of people would be treated in a manner that is appropriate to only 10 per cent of people.  I will outline some statistics on the number of asylum applications so that Members realise the extent of the problem.  In 1992 we received 39 asylum applications compared with 1,179 in 1996.  In 1997 there were 3,883 applications.  In other words, the number of applications in 1996 was 30 times that of 1992 and the number in 1997 was three and a half times that of 1996.  The figure is increasing at a time when the number seeking asylum in other European countries has declined from 674,000 to 225,000.  We must ask why this is happening and compare our position with that in other European countries.</P>

      <P>Some Members praised the Refugee Act and others were very critical of it. Some Members said there was no guaranteed right to an interpreter in all cases in the course of the procedure for dealing with manifestly unfounded claims.  Section 8(1)(b) of the Refugee Act, 1996, requires an immigration officer to give certain information to a person &ldquo;where possible in a language that the person understands&rdquo;. Section 11(8) requires the Refugee Applications Commissioner to give an asylum applicant a statement in writing specifying a range of matters &ldquo;where possible in a language that he or she understands&rdquo;.  A similar formulation is contained in section 10(1) in relation to detained persons. In other words, the Deputies' criticisms mirror exactly what is contained in the Refugee Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members also criticised the provision that, where an applicant destroys identity documents without reasonable cause and in bad faith, his or her claim would be regarded as manifestly unfounded.  Section 12 of the Refugee Act defines a manifestly unfounded application as including an application in relation to which the applicant, without reasonable cause and in bad faith, destroyed identity documents etc.  In fact, the grounds on which a claim will be determined to be manifestly unfounded, as set out in the letter of 10 December 1997 to UNHCR, are exactly the grounds specified in section 12 of the Refugee Act.  Members should be careful about what they say on this important issue.  I was pleased to note the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, availed of the opportunity last night to discourage any hostility <Col N="1043" /> or racism directed at asylum seekers.  I endorse the Minister's remarks in that respect.</P>
    <P>I will draw attention to a fatal inconsistency in the Bill.  Section 4(1)(b) would exclude from the amnesty persons who had not applied for refugee status prior to 1 January 1998.  The effect of this provision is that a great many persons who have come here to avail of social welfare or other economic opportunities, and who had the foresight to apply for refugee status before the said date, would now become the beneficiaries of an amnesty, while other immigrants in exactly the same position, except for the fact that they did not apply for refugee status, would still remain in their present position of being illegal immigrants. No Member referred to illegal immigrants since I came into the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>Section 4(1)(b) is an arbitrary distinction and it is bound to create an incentive which could lead to our asylum applications processing system being overwhelmed again in the future.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I outlined and those given by the Minister last night, I urge Members to reject this Bill.  It tries to cover 100 per cent of people with something that applies to only 10 per cent of them.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to retain a sense of reasonableness in this debate when one listens to the sleeveen speeches from Deputy Callely, who has left the House, and Deputy Carey. Deputy Callely, in particular, used the Minister's speech to justify patently racist remarks made by him some months ago and subsequently repeated in the House.  He did not apologise for those appalling remarks either inside or outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What shocked me most about the speech of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night was the utter lack of charity and the absence of any sympathy or understanding for the plight of asylum seekers.  It was a speech without a spark of compassion or an ounce of humanity. When I look at the problem of asylum seekers I see it primarily in human terms &mdash; the fear facing those who have sought refuge in this country, the uncertainty of their circumstances, their inability to make plans for the future, their status in a legal limbo and the terror of being deported back to the jurisdictions from which they fled.  When the Minister &mdash; or at least the person who wrote his speech &mdash; looks at the problem he clearly sees it through the eyes of a bureaucrat or an accountant. The preoccupation is with figures on a balance <Col N="1044" /> sheet, the potential costs, the need for effective administrative procedures and neat solutions to deal with human problems that cannot be neatly pigeon holed.  Surely we should have learned at this stage that problems involving human beings cannot be approached in the same way as problems involving surplus production in agriculture.  Deputy Lenihan, who has also left the House, referred to the problem of xenophobia in France, Germany and elsewhere because of the presence of immigrants.  Why do we allow such feelings to grow?  Why do we allow fear to be promoted?  Why do we not step in and argue against such fear instead of feeding it, as some of the statements tonight have done?</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed the Minister not only said he will not accept this Bill, but he apparently also intends to ignore the resolution passed unanimously by the Dáil on 16 December last which called for the earliest possible implementation of the Refuge Act.  In turning down the Bill he is spurning the opportunity to display some humanity on the part of the Government, to demonstrate that this country is prepared to plays its part in seeking a humane solution to a world wide problem, to show that we are prepared to give the same sort of consideration and sympathetic treatment we sought for Irish people who were illegally in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was important to recognise the clear distinction between a genuine refugee and a person who simply managed to evade immigration controls.  The Minister of State repeated that tonight.  A person is not an illegal immigrant until such time as his or her application has been processed and he or she is found to be here illegally.  It is wrong to try to create a false impression that 90 per cent of immigrants are here illegally.</P>

Can we show some of the same sympathy and understanding we sought of others?  It must be emphasised that the scale of the problem of aslyum seekers in Ireland is relatively small by international standards. Deputy McManus quoted figures and I do not propose to go over them.  It is obnoxious of the Minister of State to compare the number of refugees in the State with the size of the traveller community.  She is feeding fear and scaremongering. This is a disgrace coming from a Government Minister.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister said we need fair, rational, evenly tempered discussion, not scaremongering but he went on to use unjustified and exaggerated figures especially in regard to the potential cost of the problems. What a feeling of warmth and satisfaction it must have brought to Áine Ní Chonaill and her colleagues in the immigration control platform when they read the headlines carrying the dire ministerial warning of asylum seekers costing the Irish taxpayer £1 million per week and that an amnesty could cost £250 million per year.  Not only was the Minister irresponsible in conjuring up such figures but the media was equally irresponsible in not subjecting those figures to critical examination. We have to look seriously at how the media is treating this question of immigration and asylum seekers.  Not only are some Deputies and, since last night, some Ministers feeding scaremongering in this House and outside but the media bears a serious responsibility for the manner in which it is handling this matter and the myths and the false information which is circulating throughout the country.  The figures have little basis in fact.  The idea that if we give an amnesty to 4,000 people who are already here the figure will grow to 30,000 overnight has no basis in fact. We do not know how many brothers, sisters, wives, uncles or aunts are involved.</P>

I thank also those in the Gallery, many of whom we have spoken about, who cannot speak publicly about their situation.  They are here to give witness, along with their supporters and people who want to show solidarity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan was correct in saying this is an extraordinary measure.  It is an extraordinary measure but it has a great deal more justification than the measures introduced in the US to provide for thousands of Irish illegal emigrants than are here as asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The paucity of the Minister's response was significant but not surprising.  I had pointed out the exaggerated claims made by his Department which had proved wrong in relation to numbers. I was surprised the Minister compounded that fault to such an extraordinary degree that we have figures that are plucked out of the air.  If the Minister had doubled the figures or halved them, they would be equally meaningless.  It is a &lsquo;guesstimate&rsquo; made out of fear and cowardice.  Because he is fearful of dealing with this issue, he is trying to make the public fearful also.  He is not succeeding but that is what he is attempting to do and it is shameful.  Given that he has made the economic argument he has a duty to back it up with facts.  He has not done so.  There are no facts to substantiate it.  One important fact he has carefully excluded from the equation is that more than 90 per cent of asylum seekers here want to work and are ready to work but are not being given the chance to do so.  Most of these people have no experience of the social welfare system here.  There are employers who say they cannot get workers and yet a whole group of people want the dignity of work and want to earn their livelihoods. They are not refusing to work but the Minister is refusing to allow them to work.  I ask the Minister who is in charge of equality, where is the equality and the civil right which allows people to work, study or travel?  That is not the way to treat people who are now part of our community. They belong to us, regardless of what we call them.  Many have lived here for the past five or six years and we must not disregard them.</P>
      <P>In his contribution yesterday the Minister used the floodgates theory.  It is the theory that is used by the weak, the ineffective, and by those who are in the grip of their civil servants.  It is the last resort of the bewildered, it is the cry of chicken licken.  Chicken licken was always afraid the sky would fall on his head and went around deeply worried about this.  The floodgates theory is meaningless.  The Refugee Act can come into force if this Bill, as a pragmatic, sensible, practical measure, is put in place.  The Refugee Act is a good one and should not be messed around. Enough legislation comes through that is found to be faulty.  Let us implement this Act.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter as it has perplexed my constituents and me.  Ardara has been designated as a heritage town and, as a consequence, has developed a wonderful reputation as a tourist centre.  The need to provide a sewerage scheme is paramount for the development of the town and to encourage investment in it.  The scheme was mooted over 25 years ago.  In 1983 a preliminary report was sent to the Department. The cost at that stage was in the region of £780,000 and there was a population of 1,600 people in Ardara at that time.  In 1985 it was decided that secondary treatment would be necessary and in 1989 a new preliminary report was sent to the Department.  Since 1989 the Department has queried a number of issues which have been dealt with locally and the scheme was redesigned.</P>
      <P>In September 1995, the scheme was resubmitted to the Department of the Environment.  At that time the population was 1,900 and the cost has escalated to £2.8 million.  I appreciate the need to ensure we have secondary treatment. However, due to the delay since 1983 greater cost has been incurred for the provision of the scheme yet it is not available to us.</P>
      <P>As a member of Donegal County Council I am aware that it was in the invidious position of not being able to provide a housing scheme in the town because the sewerage scheme was not available. I ask that the scheme be made a priority. Donegal County Council made an application to the Department and the EU Commission under the Cohesion Funds for the Gaeltacht areas but the Commission saw fit not to proceed with the Ardara scheme.  A funding mechanism should be provided by the Department, whether from Structural Funds or Exchequer funds, to provide the scheme.  I hope permission will be given to the county council to proceed to the planning stage with the scheme and to allow for the preparation of contract documents.</P>

      <P>Any Members who have been to Ardara will know it is one of the most picturesque towns in Donegal.  It has been designated a heritage town and attracts many tourists from different parts of Ireland and Europe.  It is renowned for its crafts and music and is a very attractive town in every sense.  Unfortunately, it will not be able to develop to its full potential unless it has a proper sewerage scheme.  Various estimates for the cost of a sewerage scheme have been put forward dating back 20 years and the current estimate for the work is almost £3 million.  It is not the most expensive scheme planned or envisaged for Donegal, but is a crucial one for Ardara.</P>
      <P>Further development, whether private or local authority housing or industry, will be badly hampered unless a sewerage scheme is provided.  The hopes of those in the town have often been raised in the past only to be dashed.  The scheme was submitted to Europe for approval last year or the year before as one of the Gaeltacht group of schemes, but no progress has been made since then.  The ball is back in the court of the council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  We will have to finance the provision of that scheme out of our resources.  I ask the Minister to support this request because the scheme is badly needed in that little town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Coughlan and McGinley for raising this matter.  My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this matter and he asked me to take it on his behalf.</P>
      <P>As a heritage town and principal accommodation and service centre for tourism, the Minister is conscious of the need for adequate sewerage facilities at Ardara.  Before dealing with Ardara, I would like to take this opportunity to outline the wider picture in relation to the provision of water and waste water facilities for the country at large and for the county of Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, announced the largest ever national investment programme for water and sewerage treatment services.  Investment this year will amount to a massive £185 million and that represents an <Col N="1051" /> increase of just over 13 per cent on 1997 figures and a 50 per cent increase on the 1996 figure.  The unprecedented level of investment in the water and sewerage services underlines, in the most positive way, that the Government is totally committed to the improvement of the country's environmental infrastructure.  This infrastructure is needed to meet the existing and projected needs arising from residential, commercial and other development.  In 1998 a further 61 major public schemes will be starting construction on top of the same number of schemes already under construction.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say County Donegal is benefiting from this substantial level of investment. Schemes under way in the county account for an investment of well over £30 million and will have a major impact in removing existing development constraints and in providing the necessary infrastructure to support expansion of tourism and other economic sectors.  They include the Pollan Dam water supply, Bundoran sewerage, Donegal water conservation project and the Ballybofey-Stranorlar sewerage scheme.  Apart from those the 1998 investment programme will allow for planning to be advanced on sewerage schemes at Letterkenny, Donegal town, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Rossnowlagh, Killybegs, Gweedore and Carndonagh and on the Letterkenny water scheme.  All of those schemes have a completion value of about £57 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific matter raised by the Deputies, Cohesion Funding was sought for the Ardara sewerage scheme, along with Burtonport and Gweedore, under an application for assistance for Gaeltacht areas sewerage schemes in Donegal.  Unfortunately, approval has not been forthcoming and the prospects of funding under the current Cohesion Fund are not good.  Until such time as a source of funding can be identified it would not be appropriate to allow Donegal County Council to proceed any further with the planning of the Ardara scheme.  I hope the Deputies will agree that County Donegal is getting its fair share of the available funding and Ardara will be kept in mind should any additional funding become available to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to the important matter of the absence <Col N="1052" /> of primary school remedial teachers in two areas of Donegal.  I refer to an area in the north west of the country from Dunfanaghy to Creeslough to Kilmacrenan and one south of Donegal town, covering Lahey, Ballintra and Pettigo.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the younger pupils with learning difficulties are identified and the sooner steps are taken to identify those difficulties, the more successful attempts will be to overcome them.  A certain percentage of school going children cannot maintain the standards of an average class and require the services of a remedial teacher, if they are to benefit from their time spent in primary school.  It is crucial that such pupils should have the services of a remedial teacher available to them as early as possible in their school lives.  There is ample evidence to support the view that if learning problems and difficulties are identified at an early age in primary school and if such pupils have the services of a remedial teacher available to them, there is no reason many, if not most, of them should not satisfactorily complete the primary school curriculum and continue on to secondary and further education.  However, if their problems are not addressed until late in their school lives, it is often too late to correct their difficulties and such pupils tend to leave school without reaching their full educational potential.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to have remedial services available to every school child in need of them at the earliest possible stage.  Until that is done we cannot, with any conviction, maintain that every child is getting a fair chance or that the children of the nation are being treated equally.</P>
    <P>In a number of rural areas in County Donegal groups of primary schools have to manage without the services of a remedial teacher.  The first area I have in mind is that from Falcarragh to Letterkenny.  Within that area there are ten primary schools with approximately 25 teachers and in excess of 500 or 600 pupils without the service of one remedial teacher.  The schools in question are Murroe National School, the Holy Trinity School and Holy Family School in Dunfanaghy, Ballymore National School and Faugher National School in the Portnablagh area, the Church of Ireland National School and St. Mary's National School in Creeslough, Termon National School, Kilmacrenan National School and Ellistrim National School.  Children with learning difficulties attending those ten national schools must wait until they reach the post primary sector before having the benefit of a remedial teacher.  That flies in the face of all educational theory and cannot be tolerated.  Repeated representations and calls have been made to the Department in the past, but unfortunately to no avail.</P>
    <P>We can no longer accept a situation where pupils attending these primary schools in north-west Donegal are left out on a limb and their remedial needs ignored. Repeated calls have been made to have remedial teachers appointed to schools from Murroe to Dunfanaghy, Creeslough, Termon and <Col N="1053" /> Kilmacrenan but, to date, a positive response has not been received.  I ask the Minister to respond to the needs of this area when the next allocation of remedial teachers is announced.  Hopefully, this will happen in time for the next school year which commences in September.</P>
    <P>The second part of my request refers to regions south of Donegal town.  National schools in the Laghey, Ballintra and Pettigo catchment area are experiencing the same problems and difficulties as schools in the north-west of the county.  No remedial facilities are available to school children in that region until they attend post-primary schools in Donegal town or Ballyshannon which is often too late.  I am aware that some parents have transferred children with learning difficulties to other schools where remedial instruction is available.  Others are paying for special tuition from their own resources, many from limited income and means.  I urge the Minister to respond to the needs of primary pupils in the Laghey, Ballintra and Pettigo areas when he is next sanctioning the appointment of remedial teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak in support of his request.  I am <i>au fait</i> with the needs of children in the Laghey, Pettigo and Ballintra area.  I know the Minister has been inundated with representations in regard to the provision of remedial teachers in this area.  The Abbey vocational school provides some remedial education but it is most unfortunate that children in the catchment area of Laghey, Pettigo and Ballintra have not benefited from access to remedial education.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of the absolute necessity to allow all our children equal access to remedial education and I implore him to consider the two specific areas outlined by Deputy McGinley, one in the north of County Donegal and the other in the south, in which remedial teachers could be shared.  When the Minister is considering the provision of teachers for next September, I urge him to respond favourably to requests by parents and teachers for the provision of remedial education in these national school areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGinley and Coughlan for raising this issue.  I am glad of the opportunity it affords me to outline my position on the appointment of remedial teachers generally.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter, in the first instance, for the ordinary class teachers. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> Unfortunately, the areas concerned were not provided with the remedial service the Deputies have requested.  I had no hand in that.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year.</P>
    <P>Fifty four remedial teachers have been allocated for the 1997-8 school year bringing the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,242.  Of the 3,227 ordinary national schools throughout the country, 2,459 can now avail of the services of remedial teachers either on a full-time or shared basis, although I acknowledge that some schools may have to share only two teachers while others may have to share four or five.  Of the 177 ordinary national schools in County Donegal, 107 now have access to the services of a remedial teacher on a full-time or shared basis. This means that approximately 81 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Donegal currently enjoy some form of remedial service.  It is estimated that 90 per cent of the total number of primary school pupils have the possibility of access to remedial teachers. Having said that, I acknowledge that there are gaps in the service and more remedial teachers need to be employed.</P>
    <P>Special needs are one of my areas of priority and I will have an opportunity to deal with this issue in the context of staffing schedules for the 1998-9 school year.  I am currently in negotiation with the INTO on the redistribution of demographic dividend this year.  I have my own priorities as has the INTO.  Once we have concluded negotiations, we will be in a position to allocate posts.  I am very concerned about the issue of remedial teaching and I share the Deputies' views.  In all the education debates which have taken place to date there appears to be a consensus on the need to appoint more remedial teachers.  I want to reflect that in the staffing schedule for next year and I will take on board the sincere representations made by the Deputies during the debate.  I will inform them of staffing allocations when they have been decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to take some action as my request is a reasonable one.</P>
      <P>When the current building project at Scoil Naomh Pádraig Measc, Cathair Leithin, Tralee, is complete, the school will have four classrooms, a hall, a library and a staff room.  The cost of the project is in the region of £370,000, of which the Department will pay 85 per cent or £313,000 and the parents the balance of £57,000.  The parents have already raised £48,000 through local fund raising initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the project, when completed, will result in a top quality facility, the enrolment position in the school means it will be a classroom short by next September when it will qualify for <Col N="1055" /> a fifth teacher and two classrooms short by the year 2000 when it will almost certainly qualify for a sixth teacher if the numbers continue to increase at the current rate.</P>
    <P>I have statistics which support the demand for two additional classrooms for the school.  The enrolment in 1997 was 129 and the 1998 enrolment will be 140 which will make the school eligible for a fifth teacher.  The 1999 enrolment will be 149 and the enrolment in the year 2000 will be 167, which will make the school eligible for a sixth teacher by 2001.  The school's board of management has had to restrict enrolment to brothers and sisters only this year in an effort to control the intake of pupils.  Such is the popularity of the school and the demand for places that the principal receives an average of two inquiries daily from parents seeking to secure places in the school for their children.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that a local contractor will build 40 houses within a half mile of the school; I believe the scheme is at an advanced stage of planning.  This would create a further requirement for additional classroom space.  The school's architect has estimated that the cost of adding an extra two classrooms at this stage, while building is in progress, would be no more than £26,000. One classroom is approximately 150 square metres and the other is approximately 170 square metres.  The project could cost three or four times that amount if carried out at any other time.</P>
    <P>If extra classrooms are not provided, the school authorities will have to resort to the rental of prefabs. The rental of a prefab costs about £400 per month, which at 50 per cent funding means the cost to the Department will be about £2,400 per year.  When the school has six teachers, the cost to the Department of renting two prefabs will be £4,800 per year.</P>
    <P>It makes a great deal of sense for the Department to allocate an extra £25,000, of which parents will pay 15 per cent or £4,000.  The total cost to the Department will be £21,000.  This is a successful school in a growing area.  The town of Tralee is extending towards this part of Kerry and in time this will put a demand on the school which will have to be met.  I hope the Minister will respond to this concern.</P>

At present the school has a staffing level of principal plus three assistant <Col N="1056" /> teachers.  The school had an enrolment of 130 pupils on 30 September, 1997.</P>
      <P>A major building project at the school was included in the Department's 1995 capital building programme.  The Department's planning section recommended the following accommodation brief for the project &mdash; to convert three existing classrooms to two, provide one new classroom, staff room, library/medical room and toilets.  The school sought to have this brief increased to provide a total of four classrooms. Following a thorough re-examination of the case the accommodation brief was finally set at the conversion of three existing classrooms to two, the provision of two new classrooms, a general purposes room, toilets, staff room and a library/medical room.  This major building project is being handled by a consultant design team appointed by the school authorities and the building works are currently under way.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to final approval of the accommodation brief my Department's planning section wrote to the school manager advising that a comprehensive enrolment policy should be drawn up in consultation with the local schools inspector. The purpose of this policy was to ensure that the future enrolment at the school is contained at a level which can be accommodated following completion of the agreed building project.  This policy was deemed necessary in view of the fact that children from Tralee were being enrolled in the school while spare accommodation already existed in the town schools.</P>
      <P>On 6 March 1998, my Department's building unit received a facsimile message from the school principal seeking grant assistance towards the cost of a further extension comprising of two additional classrooms.  This application has been referred to my Department's planning section for examination.  As soon as this examination is completed my Department's planning and building unit will contact the school manager.</P>
      <P>I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.  We cannot immediately respond to a facsimile message which asks for the immediate provision of two extra classrooms.  It is not the way things are done.  I accept the Deputy's point about the cost implications but it is a thorny issue when there is surplus accommodation already in close proximity. There is also the issue of how to spread those resources.  I will take a personal interest in the matter and see if the numbers as outlined by the Deputy warrant the additional expenditure as there are cost benefits to be considered.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 March 1998. <Col N="1057" /></P>

      <P>The corncrake grant scheme, operated by the Irish Wildlife Conservancy, is jointly funded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.  Since 1992, this scheme has attracted State funding through Dúchas of £333,000, including a grant of £64,000 committed for the current year.  In addition a sum of £2,500 is being provided this year to assist in the funding of a national corncrake census.  The Irish Wildbird Conservancy supplies data in relation to corncrake numbers occurring in core areas not by county are set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, the figures are disappointing and do not adequately reflect the resources and commitment to the scheme of the project partners &mdash; Dúchas, RSPB and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy. The project partners have agreed that the future strategy for corncrake conservation will be based largely on SAC compensation measures operated through the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) managed by the Department of Agriculture and Food, and through the SAC scheme managed by my Department.  Discussions are continuing with conservationists, farmers representatives, the Department of Agriculture and Food and farm planners under the REP scheme to agree an appropriate prescription for corncrake friendly farming.  Pending agreement on this prescription the current funding of the corncrake grant scheme will remain in place.  Dúchas is also endeavouring to purchase and lease back by agreement suitable corncrake habitat for management in a corncrake friendly way.  The scheme will again be reviewed at the end of the current year by the project partners to determine the best future strategy for the conservation of this important species. <Col N="1059" /></P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 1 of 5 February 1998 in which I indicated to the House that I am in the process of developing proposals on digital broadcasting as a matter of urgency and that I envisage consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise.  It is my responsibility to develop proposals for the establishment of appropriate statutory structures to oversee the introduction and ongoing regulation, from a broadcasting perspective, of Irish digital broadcasting services.  Matters relating to telecommunications policy fall under the remit of the Minister for Public Enterprise and there is a role for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in relation to radio frequency spectrum management and technical licensing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the European Commission's Green Paper on Convergence, the Minister for Public Enterprise is in the process of preparing a response to the Green Paper and has launched a public call for written submissions.  The Green Paper poses almost 30 questions on various aspects of convergence.  My Department is considering these questions from a broadcasting policy perspective and will liaise closely with the Department of Public Enterprise in finalising a <Col N="1060" /> response to the European Commission.  I am also aware that there is ongoing liaison between the Department of Public Enterprise, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to issues such as encryption, digital signatures and conditional access.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there will be co-ordinated action and duplication will be avoided.</P>

      <P>The improvement of access to the offshore islands is being actively pursued by my Department. I recently awarded contracts for the provision of scheduled passenger ferry services on a pilot basis between the islands of Inishboffin, Inishturk and Clare Island and the mainland. These services commenced operation in February 1998.  My Department also currently subsidises the provision of scheduled ferry services serving the three Aran Islands and Oileán Cléire, County Cork.  In addition almost £800,000 was spent in 1997 from my Department's islands development fund on access related projects.  It is estimated that up to £4.5 million will have been spent by my Department on improved access to Oileán Thoraigh by the end of 1998 through the provision of major service facilities.</P>
      <P>During my visits to the offshore islands the problem of access was raised as one of the most important issues affecting island life which needs to be addressed.  At present a programme of works for 1998 is being prepared in consultation with the relevant local authorities which will include works to improve access to the islands. Consideration is also being given to the major access requirements of the islands and a programme to deal with these requirements in the long-term is being prepared.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Commissioners of Public Works, on behalf of my Department, have recently applied to Kildare County Council for planning permission to undertake restoration works at Maynooth Castle.  Planning notices appeared in the main daily papers on 24 February <Col N="1061" /> last and an application for planning permission was formally lodged with Kildare County Council by the Office of Public Works this week.</P>
      <P>The works to be undertaken at the castle involve the reroofing of the keep in order to preserve and present the monument for public access in a form that maintains the landscape setting of the castle ruins, with minimal additions necessary for the use of the castle for exhibitions, assembly and services for guides.  I have set aside £1.5 million to fund these works under the operation programme for tourism 1994-99 and, subject to receipt of planning permission, it is envisaged that the works will be carried out in 1998 and 1999.</P>

      <P>The EU habitats directive requires member states to designate their most important natural areas as special areas of conservation, of SACs, and to prevent anything that would damage their ecology.  Their directive identifies active blanket bog, which includes large areas of our uplands, as a priority for such protection. Some 200,000 hectares of blanket bog have been proposed for inclusion in Ireland's SAC network.</P>
      <P>Land in such areas, and in other areas classified as overgrazed by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will be required to be farmed in accordance with an approved agri-environmental protection plan.  For those who join the rural environmental protection scheme, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, this will be the REP scheme.  For those who decide not to join REPS, a plan will be prepared by my Department.</P>
      <P>These plans will specify conditions or restrictions that must be complied with to protect the ecology of the proposed SAC in question, including any stocking restrictions or reductions needed to prevent damage by overgrazing.  For commonages, which tend to be the most damaged areas, each individual farm plan impacting on the commonage will have to comply with an overall commonage plan, which will specify the overall maximum sustainable stock numbers that the land can carry.  These commonage plans will be arranged by my Department.  In addition, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, that the payment of headage and premia has been made conditional on compliance with such agri-environmental plans for farmers who have shares in commonages within proposed SACs in areas designated as overgrazed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation is available for those who suffer losses because of restrictions designed to protect proposed SACs.  Those with land in proposed SACs who join REPS will be eligible for payments additional to standard payments under REPS.  Those who decide not to join REPS can quantify the losses that result from complying with restrictions specified in my Department's <Col N="1064" /> conservation plan for their farm and claim compensation from my Department.  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.</P>

      <P>Following the report of the special working group on the film production industry established in 1992 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, a programme of concerted Government investment in the film industry was initiated, commencing in 1993.</P>
      <P>This programme resulted in a rapid development of the potential of the industry, with production figures rising from two or three feature film productions each year to current levels of some 18 feature films each year.  In addition, a number of widely popular international television series have been produced here, in some cases running to several series, over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the period 1992-98 there has been a corresponding growth in the number of people employed in the industry, with increasing levels of skill and competence made possible by the dramatically increased opportunities for on the <Col N="1065" /> job training backed by measures provided by Screen Training Ireland.  Providers of facilities have also availed of the opportunity offered by this sustained production to investment and expand.</P>
    <P>The level of film activity now is such that there can be no doubt as to the potential for a firmly established and increasingly commercial and competitive indigenous film and television production industry here, and also serving the demands of the international market.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, I am establishing an industry think thank to evaluate the effectiveness of existing schemes and incentives and to formulate a strategic plan for the future of the industry. Arrangements for the operation of the screen commission are now being finalised and the necessary funding for its activities having been secured.  I understand that an announcement about this matter will be made shortly by Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  These initiatives will make a major contribution to the future strength of the Irish film industry into the next millennium.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that phase II of the works to the main block of Castletown House commenced in January last and is due for completion by the end of 1998.  This phase involves mechanical, electrical, fire and security works and structural repairs which are necessary in order to secure the fabric of the house and to install all the necessary infrastructure to ensure that it complies with the best current practice and standards for historic buildings in respect of fire, health, safety and security. This phase will cost a total of £2.8 million which is being funded under the EU operational programme for tourism 1994-99, and it is expected that some £2.2 million of this will be expended this year.</P>
      <P>As these works are only basic works to secure the fabric of the house and to protect it from the hazards of fire and intrusion, further works will have to be carried out once phase II is completed in order to restore the house internally and to provide proper visitor facilities both in the house and in the demesne generally.  These works will be carried out on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The EU habitats directive requires member states to protect their most important natural areas and to prevent anything that would damage the ecology of these areas. The directive identifies active bogland as a priority for such protection.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of active bogland affected by the directive's obligations.  The blanket bogs of upland areas comprise about 200,000 hectares of our proposed SAC network, while raised or lowland bog comprises about 8,000 hectares of our proposed SACs.</P>
      <P>Although both types of bog must be protected, clearly the position is more pressing in the case of raised bogs, given their relative rarity.</P>
      <P>In blanket bogs proposed for SAC status, my Department is working towards the general objective of phasing out turf cutting within five to ten years.  However, these areas are being looked at in detail to identify areas where cutting could continue for longer periods without compromising the integrity of larger intact areas.  The results of this exercise will be made public shortly for the Connemara area, and other upland areas will then be looked at over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Raised bogs are clearly much rarer both in an Irish and a European context and, consequently, my Department has been seeking an immediate cessation of cutting in these areas.  However, there are important issues to be addressed in the context of implementing this cessation, such as whether there are areas where cutting can continue without causing ecological damage, the level and kind of compensation to be paid to those affected and the arrangements for relocation to alternative bogs for those who wish to continue to cut turf.  In addition, the SAC appeals <Col N="1067" /> advisory committee, which will consider appeals against the extent of SAC designation proposals and conditions proposed to conserve them, has not yet commenced its work and will not have time to resolve outstanding appeals before the 1998 turf cutting season starts.  To allow time for agreement to be reached on relevant issues, for necessary logistical and adminstrative arrangements to be advanced and for objections to the extent of designation proposals to be resolved, I have decided to allow cutting to continue on proposed SAC raised bogs for the 1998 season.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the benefits of an agreed approach will be very substantial and will greatly increase public support for conservation, without which it cannot ultimately succeed.</P>

      <Col N="1068" /> Deputies will be aware that I place a great importance on the development of the indigenous Irish music industry.  To this end my Department is continuing to operate the business expansion scheme for new artists which is intended to encourage investment into what is still a high risk industry.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have considered the most recent reports into the music industry which have suggested that the establishment of a specially designated body, or music board, would be the single most important initiative that can be taken to assist the development of our music industry. With this in mind, I met the representatives of the industry, the IBEC music industry group, on 28 January 1998, to discuss the possibilities of a partnership between the industry and the Government in establishing such a board.  Such a partnership was envisaged in both IBEC's own report, Striking the Right Note, and the report of the music task force, FORTE, entitled Access All Areas.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I received from the music industry group of IBEC their proposal for a music board, based on the FORTE model.  I will examine their proposal and engage in consultation with the group as necessary in order to make further progress in the matter.</P>
    <P>I envisage it being the responsibility of any music board that is established to promote Ireland as a world centre for all aspects of music creation and distribution.</P>

However, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has an ongoing wildlife monitoring programme in place which carries out regular surveys on all aspects of our wildlife, both flora and fauna.

If the Deputy has any particular species in mind, I will be happy to furnish him with details of research or survey data available to me in relation to such species.  Also, the publication of red data books, on which Dúchas has extensively collaborated in recent years, provide a useful guide to many of the threatened species of wildlife in this country and their conservation status.</P>

      <P>The current Finance Bill provides for the introduction of a rural renewal scheme on a pilot basis to reinvigorate certain parts of rural Ireland.  As the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech, it is impossible to designate all of rural Ireland and he indicated that he would look carefully at the feasibility of a pilot initiative which would apply in the Upper Shannon region.  The area proposed for designation comprises all of Counties Leitrim and Longford, north County Roscommon, the western part of County Cavan and a large part of County Sligo.  I am delighted that substantial parts of the counties adjoining the Upper Shannon area are proposed to be designated as a qualifying area in the Bill as such designation will undoubtedly lead to enhancement of those areas and facilitate the further development of tourism associated with the River Shannon.</P>

      <P>Following confirmation of the presence of the non-native zebra mussel in the Shannon catchment last year, the Marine Institute <Col N="1074" /> initiated an urgent investigation, the results of which have formed the basis of management strategies to contain and deal with the phenomenon. All the agencies involved are working together, including the Central, Shannon and Northern Regional Fisheries Boards, the Environmental Protection Agency, my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  A zebra mussel steering group has been established representative of all interests to drive an action plan covering:</P>
      <P>&mdash; information dissemination</P>
      <P>&mdash; monitoring of locations of zebra mussels and other non-native species</P>
      <P>&mdash; scientific assessment of the mussels' long-term ecological impact</P>
      <P>&mdash; advice on appropriate control measures</P>
      <P>The steering group is monitoring progress on all these fronts.  An information leaflet on zebra mussels and steps to control their proliferation was issued last year to the main water user organisations in the Shannon area, including Lough Derg angling groups, the Inland Waterways Association and An Taisce.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Marine Institute to report to me regularly on the action under way to address the problem, to advise on future additional strategies which might be necessary to tackle the proliferation of this species and to report on the results of ongoing monitoring of the species.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute has, at my direction, already carried out extensive surveys of the distribution of the species and will continue these studies during the year.</P>
      <P>The development of further management, information and remedial strategies is ongoing and will be informed by the surveys and the outcome of a conference held in Galway last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The authorisation held by Gaelic Seafoods Ltd., under the Fisheries Acts in respect of salmon smolt production in Lough Allen does not include any legal provision in relation to trout restocking nor does the planning permission granted by Leitrim County Council for those operations (in the name of Salmara Fisheries Ltd., which subsequently sold its fish farming operations to Gaelic Seafoods Ltd.).  Any working arrangements by Salmara (a subsidiary of the ESB) to facilitate trout restocking programmes on Lough Allen by the ESB (which has particular fisheries responsibilities in relation to the Shannon catchment generally) would have been a matter between Salmara and the ESB itself.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the ESB carried out some juvenile trout restocking in Lough Allen last year. I have asked the Department to follow up with the ESB and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board on the plans, and scope, for future restocking programmes and I will arrange to have the Deputy kept informed of developments.</P>

      <P>The issue of Ireland's continued Objective 1 status has been addressed in Agenda 2000, the European Commission's proposals for EU policies in the period 2000-2006.  In this document, the Commission has proposed transitional arrangements for regions like Ireland which are currently eligible for Objective 1 status but which will have <Col N="1082" /> passed the eligibility threshold of 75 per cent of EU average <i>per capita</i> income levels.  Formal proposals on detailed new Regulations governing the nature of the transition are expected shortly from the Commission.  Negotiations on the substance of these are likely to begin this year and may continue into next year.</P>
      <P>The negotiations in question will involve agreement with the European Commission and the Council of a satisfactory transitional regime to cover the situation in which Ireland as a whole can no longer expect to qualify as an Objective 1 region on the basis of having a per capital GDP below 75 per cent of the Community average. Notwithstanding this, it is the Government's position that transition arrangements must ensure continued and generous access to the Objective 1 funding envelope during the next programming period, so as to meet the substantial backlogs in infrastructural and social development which continue to persist in Ireland and which are even, to a degree, accentuated by our recent economic success.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Government is especially conscious of the needs of the less-developed parts of the country and those suffering from population decline and will do all in their power to ensure that the needs of these areas are properly addressed, as promised in the Government's Programme, &ldquo;An Action Plan for the Millennium&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The policy document Planning for the Future published in 1984 has been accepted by successive Governments as a blueprint for the development of mental health services.  A key recommendation of that document is that a community-based mental health service be developed to replace the traditional model of care which relied predominantly on in-patient treatment in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in implementing this policy and in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting.  Health boards have developed and <Col N="1084" /> are continuing to develop a modern, comprehensive community-based mental health service.  This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services.</P>
    <P>I have seen the article referred to by the Deputy.  I do not accept that there is a funding crisis in the service or that patients are discharged as a cost saving measure.  Decisions relating to discharges from in-patient care are based solely on the clinical needs of patients.  In the health board area to which the article mainly relates, I understand that protocols are in place in relation to patients being discharged home and such patients are followed up in the community by the board's community and mental health service.</P>

      <P>Entry by general practitioners to the general medical services scheme is by way of open competition and competitive interview for new posts, vacancies and assistant-with-a-view to partnerships posts.  These competitions for posts are publicly advertised by the relevant health boards.  The procedures governing entry are the subject of an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) which specifically addresses the criteria for filling vacancies and creating new posts; the consultation process in respect of new posts created and vacancies suppressed, recruitment of partners and assistants; and interviewing of applicants.</P>
      <P>In arriving at a decision on the filling of a vacancy or the creation of a new post, health boards are required to take the following into account: the provision of a proper level of access to general practitioner services for patients; that patients have a reasonable degree of choice in selecting a practitioner; and that due regard is given, on the basis of agreed guidelines, to the question of the viability of practices in the area in question. The agreed procedures also provide for the composition of the interview board together with guidelines on a marking system to be used in assessing candidates at interview.  Health boards are not in a position to amend or circumvent these nationally agreed entry procedures.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the waiting time in casualty at Saint James's Hospital, Dublin which, for patients who are not critical, is eight to 12 hours and that many who are detained overnight are required to sleep on trolleys in the accident and emergency department; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this situation will be made even more acute by the closures of the Meath and Adelaide hospitals; and the plans, if any, he has to deal with this already chronic situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a significant increase in the number of attendances at the accident and emergency department in St. James's Hospital during January and February 1998 in comparison with the same period in 1997.  This increase in activity has resulted in patients with non-urgent conditions experiencing a delay in receiving treatment, and an overall difficulty in the hospital in accommodating <Col N="1087" /> the significantly higher level of patients requiring admission.</P>
      <P>In order to address this increasing workload, the hospital authorities have recently made a submission to my Department setting out plans to develop facilities and resources within the accident and emergency area.  The hospital's proposals include provision for a second accident and emergency consultant, additional general practitioners and additional emergency nurse practitioners. The Deputy will be pleased to know that my Department has recently given its approval to commence the recruitment process of a second accident and emergency consultant in St. James's Hospital and that an additional £200,000 was provided in the hospital's 1998 allocation to help alleviate difficulties in the accident and emergency area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the factors which determine levels of attendances at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict.  More than 20,000 of the annual accident and emergency attendances at St. James's Hospital come from areas which will be served by the new hospital at Tallaght.  A similar situation exists with regard to out-patient appointments.  The shift in patterns of attendances following the opening of the new hospital at Tallaght will be carefully monitored by the Eastern Health Board and it is likely that clearer patterns will emerge in the six to nine months following the new hospital's opening.  Any subsequent recommendations will be fully considered by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1996 local authorities carried out an assessment of housing needs in their areas. Details of the results, based on returns from local authorities, are included in Part XII of my Department's annual housing statistics bulletin for 1996, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  At that time 749 traveller families were assessed as in need of housing and a further 734 families as being suited to accomodation in caravan parks.  These figures include families on the roadside, families in temporary local authority accommodation seeking permanent accommodation and families in permanent accommodation seeking a change to a different type of accommodation.</P>
      <P>Local authorities provide accommodation for travellers through the letting of houses from their existing or new housing stock, or in traveller group housing schemes and in serviced bays on halting sites.  Between the annual count of travellers carried out in November 1996 and November 1997, there was a net increase of 189 families in housing provided by or with the assistance of local authorities and halting site accommodation. At the end of this period there were 3,394 traveller families in local authority or local authority assisted accommodation, an estimated further 266 families were in private accommodation and 1,127 families were on the roadside or other unserviced locations.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the national strategy on traveller accommodation will be underpinned by forthcoming legislation and this should secure a sustained expansion in local authority programmes for the provision of suitable accommodation to meet the needs of travellers.  A capital allocation of £11 million has been provided in 1998 for the provision of group housing schemes and halting sites compared with an outturn of £9.5 million in 1997.</P>

This provides for full relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner or occupier of a building of significant historical, architectural or aesthetic interest in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance, or restoration of such a building, subject to the provision of public access to the building.  This relief also extends to any garden or grounds of an ornamental nature occupied or enjoyed with such a building.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, has powers to provide advice and assistance (including financial assistance) to persons and bodies in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage, including the architectural heritage.  The council is located in Rothe House, Kilkenny City (telephone number 056-70777 and fax number 056-70788).  It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings has also been addressed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in the context of the Urban and Village Renewal sub-programme of the EU co-funded Operational Programme for <Col N="1093" /> Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99. This sub-programme, <i>inter alia,</i> provides support to civic trusts, conservation groups and local authorities to promote various urban conservation measures in towns throughout the country.  The scheme involves giving grant aid to local authorities and other bodies on the basis of matching funds from local scources.  The objective is to rehabilitate the built environment, in city-town centre areas, through the conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings.</P>
    <P>Under the urban renewal schemes, operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the full construction costs incurred in the refurbishment of an existing building in a designated area for residential purposes can be offset against the owner-occupier's and-or lessor's tax liability over a period of ten years.  In the case of existing buildings which are refurbished for certain approved commercial uses, excluding offices, half of the construction costs can be offset against the owner-occupier's and-or lessors's tax liability over a period of ten years.  These incentives apply to heritage buildings in the same way as to other buildings.  In general, the Urban Renewal Tax Incentives Schemes favour refurbishment over new construction.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage contains a number of recommendations for the introduction of a package of financial incentives for owners of listed buildings (recommendations 45-54), based on a dual approach of fiscal incentives or direct grant aid (recommendation 45). The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and myself are currently finalising a package of legislative, financial and administrative proposals for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage, based on the recommendations contained in that report, and we hope to have this package considered by Government shortly.</P>

      <P>A discussion document entitled &ldquo;Developing a Government Policy on Architecture, a Proposed Framework and Discussion of Issues&rdquo; was published by my predecessor in September 1996.  This initiated a public debate on architecture and the role of Government.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, the then Government formally adopted the following policy statement on architecture:</P>
      <P>In pursuing its Policy on Architecture, the Government will:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> 1. promote high standards of design and construction in building works for which it is responsible and support the pursuit of high standards of building;</P>

    <P>4. foster the demand for high quality architecture in the community as a whole;</P>
    <P>5. promote the concept of sustainable development;</P>
    <P>6. encourage innovation in architecture.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that the Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands would co-ordinate development of individual strategies with appropriate Government Departments within the context of this broad policy objective and would return to Government with specific proposals.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I am now establishing an interdepartmental working group, which will be chaired by the principal architect of the Office of Public Works, to initiate and co-ordinate development of individual strategies for submission by me to Government.</P>

      <P>Under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and regulations made under that Act, applicants for legal services are required to satisfy a test of financial eligibility.  Accordingly legal services are available only to persons whose disposable income does not exceed £7,350.  Disposable income is calculated by reference to any income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive from all sources in the 12 months following the date of application, including: &ldquo;benefits, allowances or pensions payable under the Social Welfare Acts, the Health Acts or the Redundancy Payments Acts&rdquo;, reduced by the aggregate of the allowances which can be offset against income.  These allowances include £668 for each dependent child, an allowance in respect of expenses incurred on child care facilities in certain circumstances and other expenses such as the cost of travel to work, hire purchase payments, loan interest payments, rent, board and lodging etc.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the Legal Aid Board took a decision that child benefit should be excluded from income for the purpose of determining an applicant's financial eligibility.  Accordingly, as and from 6 January 1998, child benefit has not been assessed as income by the Legal Aid Board when determining an applicant's eligibility for legal services under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. The need for an amendment to the civil legal aid regulations to reflect this change is receiving attention in my Department.  My Department, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board, continually monitors the financial eligibility criteria and appropriate adjustments are made to the criteria from time to time, as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations committee, in considering Ireland's first report on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, welcomed, among other matters, provisions in relation to children in the Family Law Act, 1995, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 and the Children Act, 1997.  However, the committee did indicate concern about lack of guarantees for a child to maintain contact with both parents after divorce. The committee did not expressly refer to the position in the context of our separation laws, the operation of which we have, of course, more experience but the reasonable assumption is that <Col N="1097" /> the committee probably equated separation with divorce.  The committee did not develop the point of concern which it had about guarantees for a child to maintain contact with both parents following the breakdown of a marriage.</P>
      <P>Under the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 the court must, in deciding questions relating to children, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to that important criterion, which is applicable in many other jurisdictions, the same Act empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning children. The Children Act, 1997 inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to indicate that the court had discretion whether or not to order joint custody. In the course of passage of the Bill, I strengthened, with the agreement of the House, the provisions in this area with a provision to indicate that the court, in making decisions in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.  That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Where proceedings are initiated the court, under the Act of 1997 must also, in appropriate cases, consider the wishes of the child.</P>
      <P>It is in the best interests of all concerned, particularly the interests of children, when parents can agree between them the arrangements in relation to the custody of and access to their children, following on separation or divorce, rather than have the courts decide the matter.  Of importance in this context is that the Act of 1997 places a new emphasis on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms involving counselling and mediation and obliges solicitors acting for the parties to bring the possibilities offered by such procedures to the attention of their clients.  It is well recognised that, where couples are separating, counselling and mediation can offer lasting affects which may benefit themselves and their children.  The Government has allocated substantial extra funding in 1998 for the development of counselling and mediation services.  These are substantial new child-centred provisions in our laws and the hope and expectation must be that their operation will help to improve the position of both parents and children following the breakdown of a marriage.  The matter will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question <Col N="1098" /> refers to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, which provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses.  Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, provides a special procedure whereby owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property.  The Act also contains a provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration.  Where the Registrar is of the opinion that any party to the arbitration has behaved unreasonably and as a result caused the incurring of the cost of the arbitration he or she may direct that that party pay all or part of such cost.  I should mention also that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, contains similar provisions where the property in question is not a dwellinghouse and, accordingly, falls outside the scope of the special procedure provided for in Part III of the 1978 (No. 2) Act.  I am not aware of any difficulties being experienced in this regard, but if the Deputy has any specific information which he would like to bring to my attention I will be happy to have it examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools, with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>As a guideline, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
      <P>Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme, as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pupils from the area referred to by the Deputy live between 0.2 and 0.5 miles from the present pick-up point.  As this is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the overall context of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department to re-route the school bus as requested. <Col N="1104" /></P>
