      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Sargent.  I call on the Deputy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil in light of the meeting this morning between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The business of the House should be suspended to allow time for a debate on the failure of successive Governments to act on the recommendations of the 1992 Annual Report of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It states that obvious opportunities for fraud and tax evasion by way of DIRT arising from the State's slip-shod approach to regulating the granting of tax exempt status to certain bodies should be closed.  In six years there has been no legislative movement on this issue.  In the light of this morning's meeting the Government could help by making an announcement about what it will do about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government set out in detail the legal problem it is facing in drafting legislation to enhance the powers of the Committee <Col N="790" /> of Public Accounts so that the committee's views on legal issues can be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has done that.  We have identified areas which are being examined by the Attorney General and the legal representatives of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There was a useful and productive meeting yesterday evening between the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Government Whip.  The chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts presented some aspects that the committee wishes to be dealt with by the Government and it is the Government's intention to do that.  There will be further detailed meetings tomorrow at which I hope this matter can be resolved between the legal team of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Attorney General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the full extent of the legal difficulties, or only an outline of them, been set out to the committee's representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not attend those meetings, but anything that has emerged to date will be given to the legal representatives tomorrow.  On yesterday's Order of Business I said there had been a meeting between the legal team of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Attorney General, but I wish to correct that.  There have been several meetings between them.  They are hopeful that they can conclude those aspects of the difficulties involved tomorrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A constitutional difficulty may arise because the Comptroller and Auditor General has a specific constitutional role.  The Attorney General's concern is that we ensure any legislative amendments we make do not cut across the Comptroller and Auditor General's specified constitutional role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate matter, will the Taoiseach convey to the three heads of State who will be present at the unique and happy events taking place in Belgium, the support of this House for them and give an assurance that the memory of those European soldiers who died on our behalf more than 80 years ago will not be forgotten as it was in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the Deputy's suggestion.  It is important to acknowledge this initiative which was presented to me by Glen Barr and a former Member of the House, Mr. Paddy Harte, a year ago today.  I acknowledge the work of all those who helped in this initiative.  It is an important day in historical terms.  The King of Belgium, the Queen of England, our President and the Army No. 1 Band will attend this ceremony. A great deal of work was done by FÁS workers and I commend the work done by those in the training authority in Northern Ireland. <Col N="791" /> Church leaders and choirs will be involved as will the media and other members of the public.  It will be the start of a commemoration because I hope the location is one which many from this island will visit, both North and South, to remember the 50,000 people from all parts of the island who died in all of the battles of the Great War. The ceremony is a fitting commemoration and the start of a fitting commemoration of all of those who died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach on behalf of the relatives and families of the people who are being commemorated today.  The generosity of the tribute paid by the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is welcomed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in congratulating all concerned with the memorial in Belgium.  I also praise the role of former Fine Gael Deputy, Paddy Harte, and Glen Barr.  The memorial was their initiative.  It may be appropriate if we could find time today or tomorrow for brief statements to mark the 80th anniversary of Armistice Day.  It was an appalling war in which many thousands of people across the western world lost their lives.  In view of the reconciliation taking place on this island and between Britain and Ireland it would be fitting for the House to mark the event in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other party leaders in paying tribute to all those involved in bringing about today's joint commemoration at Messines in Belgium to commemorate all those Irish who died in Flanders, Gallipoli and elsewhere during the Great War.  These people have not been adequately mourned because other events attracted attention shortly after their deaths.  It is only now, 80 years later, that we are coming to terms with the wounds left with so many Irish families by the Great War.  It is appropriate that that healing is taking place now when I hope peace is coming at last to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important day of commemoration. I congratulate Paddy Harte and all those who worked so hard in the work of reconciliation and commemoration in Belgium.  It reminds us not just of all those who died but of those who fought.  Many of these died recently and they will tragically never know of the reconciliation that has taken place and the degree of respect in which they are held by people from all traditions.  They include my relations as well as relatives of many others in this House.  I join with others in asking for this anniversary to be commemorated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete the requirement to have a barrister or solicitor sitting on the appeals committee to be established in accordance with section 29.  My aim is to address a concern expressed on Committee Stage and at the same time to increase flexibility in the composition of appeals committees.  The presence of a barrister or solicitor on the committee might lead to appellants bringing their own legal representation.  This would run contrary to the intention of the section which is that the committee should operate with the minimum of formality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the same reason I do not intend to accept Deputy O'Shea's amendment to amendment No. 155.  It would have the effect of reinstating the requirement that a barrister or solicitor sit on the <Col N="798" /> appeals committee.  I do not intend to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 156.  It would have the opposite effect of restricting flexibility in this regard.  While I accept that people with front line experience may have much to offer to the work of appeals committees, others with different experience are also likely to be valuable additions to committees.  Deputy Bruton's amendment might have the undesirable effect of limiting the flexibility to appoint such persons to appeal committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 155:</P>
      <P>In the first and second lines, to delete &ldquo;a practising barrister or solicitor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the debate on Committee Stage the Minister proposed that a practising barrister or solicitor should have no less than ten years standing.  An amendment of mine was agreed to reduce the limit to seven years.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is now proposing to completely remove the provision.</P>
      <P>I agree with the idea that appeal hearings should be as informal as possible and people should not feel intimidated.  However, the public is orientated towards litigation and it is important that a legal person is <i>in situ</i> to advise the committee on points of law which may arise, particularly in the context of an appellant having legal representation at an appeal hearing.  The position regarding procedures is unclear, but my fear, which I expressed on Committee Stage, is that the legal costs in this area could be high.</P>
      <P>The basic consideration is that appeal hearings are as consumer friendly and informal as possible. However, regardless of whether the legal person sits as a member of the appeal committee or acts as a legal adviser to it, it is unwise to remove him or her completely from the proceedings.  This could lead to unnecessarily extended hearings.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to remove the reference to not less than seven years standing. There should be no restriction on the experience of the practising barrister or solicitor.  It is unwise to completely remove a legal person from the hearing process, particularly in circumstances where the appellant can have legal representation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a) the parties to the appeal are assisted to reach agreement on the matters the subject of the appeal where the appeals committee is of the opinion that reaching such agreement is practicable in the circumstances,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was discussion on Committee Stage about the need to introduce an element of conciliation and arbitration into the appeals process.  The amendment provides that the parties to the appeal should be assisted to reach agreement on matters the subject of the appeal where the appeals committee is of the opinion that reaching such agreement is practicable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the amendment. It is reasonable that there should be such a process.  Deputy O'Shea's idea of a conciliation process separate from the appeals committee is a more logical approach than taking it to the level of legalistic presentations to appeals committees. A process of conciliation and intervention at an earlier stage is more appropriate.  However, Deputy O'Shea's amendment did not find sympathy with the Minister and we cannot debate that issue again.  I will accept this <i>faute de mieux.</i></P>

I am concerned that it may lead to a protracted appeals system.  I ask the Minister to assure me about the effectiveness of whatever conciliation procedure is put in place.  As presented in the amendment, it appears informal and unfocused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of conciliation was raised on Committee Stage by Deputy O'Shea as a potentially preferable option in terms of appellants and school managements reaching agreement in relation to disputes or matters of concern. It is a good idea and I introduced the amendment to try to incorporate it.  However, some flexibility must be allowed in terms of how the appeals committee will operate.  Invariably subjective judgments will have to be made by those most closely involved.  It is difficult to be <Col N="800" /> prescriptive in legislation but it is not the intention &mdash; this can be provided for in regulations &mdash; that this should lead to a protracted appeals process. The central objective should be the processing of appeals as quickly as possible.  One cannot have children out of school for three or four months waiting for a result.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a timescale to the appeals process.  All appeals must be dealt with within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the appeal with an additional 14 days permitted in particular circumstances. Amendment No. 159 would have the same effect. The amendment is in response to concerns articulated by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage.  It also meets the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Shea.</P>

      <Col N="801" /> This is a technical amendment.  Section 29 covers appeals by students.  By definition, a person becomes a student only when enrolled in a school.  Section 29, as it stands, does not cover those seeking to become enrolled.  The amendment addresses this matter.</P>

      <P>(d) the guidance and counselling provision to be offered in schools.</P>
      <P>Section 30 gives the Minister power to specify details of the curriculum.  It is important that appropriate guidance and counselling services are provided within schools to help children make choices and cater for their wider needs.  There is a debate about the adequacy of such services. There is also a debate about the way the time devoted to guidance and counselling is allocated. Frequently where this task is assigned to a particular person on a part-time basis the function is eroded.  There is, therefore, a need to issue clear guidelines on access to guidance and counselling services which are an integral part of a successful curriculum.</P>

Surveys have found that early school leavers did not have access to guidance and counselling services.  In practice such services are only provided for senior cycle students.  The Minister is giving himself the power to deal with the syllabus and specify the time to be allocated to each subject.  This should extend to guidance and counselling services.  This area has not been developed.</P>

      <P>In page 27, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) shall seek to ensure that the subjects and syllabi followed in a school will be appropriate and relevant to the educational and vocational needs of the students.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is amplifying his powers in this section in terms of the curriculum and is taking on powers to require syllabi to have regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the time allotted to different subjects, etc.  . A requirement to seek to ensure the subjects and syllabi followed in a school would be appropriate and relevant to the educational and vocational needs of the students is remarkable by its absence.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinarily rigid structure in our education system, which is very much oriented to the leaving certificate and, ironically, even those who pursue its vocational aspects do not get preferential access afterwards to apprenticeships, for example.  It is a remarkably rigid system very much dictated by entry to third level, which is the touchstone against which the success of students is judged.  That is an inappropriate orientation for many students and the Minister cannot break from it entirely in the Bill.  It will be a more gradual process to build up recognition for non-conventional streams and ensure there are routes to allow progress to third level if students so choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be merit in the Minister taking up powers to ensure there is a reasonable match in schools between subject choices and the needs of pupils.  If this is left exclusively to schools, the Minister may perpetuate areas which just do not cater for the needs of certain pupils and there will be gaps with children struggling in schools whose orientation is inappropriate.  There is a role for the Minister in protecting and developing the vocational strands in the system.  He and his predecessors have done good work in developing the leaving certificate applied and although it has gained a certain foothold, it is still not accepted <Col N="803" /> by the third level sector.  A great deal of work must still be done on accreditation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will play a role in trying to ensure schools cater for a broad range of needs among pupils and do not simply say that they have always offered Latin and Greek, for example, and that will remain the case.  The Minister may feel the wording of the amendment needs to be modified or improved.  However, I outlined what I hope the amendment will achieve in this neglected area of the education system.  It has developed too rigidly and focused with few opportunities for progression and recognition of other activities in schools.  This may provide a small bridgehead for the Minister to develop this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in the argument advanced by Deputy Bruton and I wish to instance a situation that has pertained during my time as a public representative.  There is no VEC presence between Dungarvan, County Waterford and Fermoy, County Cork.  This area comprises towns such as Cappoquin, Lismore, Tallow and Ballyduff.  There is a project under way whereby there will be an amalgamation and a community school will be provided but the needs of students in that area who are not academically inclined have not been met appropriately.  A campaign for a new school in the area has been running for years.  It has ebbed and flowed and hopefully the Minister will see it through to its conclusion.  The curricula of schools should be tailored to meet the needs of students and it makes sense to provide for such a contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the Deputies. Partnership is a feature of the Bill.  No Minister would wish to unilaterally engage in forcing schools in a certain direction in terms of their curricula but recent research carried out by the Department on early school leavers suggests that certain schools would have benefited if they had taken up alternative leaving certificate programmes. There is merit in the Minister having a legislative basis to intervene in such situations in order to provide students with an education that would be relevant to them.  I accept the amendment subject to its being redrafted before the Bill is sent to the Seanad.  The uptake on leaving certificate applied and vocational courses has been very good generally and the numbers are going according to plan.  The foundation course for the junior certificate and transition year have been successfully implemented, although there is evidence in certain areas that schools have still not taken up transition year.  There is merit in the amendment but it will have to be used sensitively by future Ministers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 164:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 40, after persons &ldquo;to insert (to be called the National Committee on the Irish Language) the overall remit of which shall be to examine the methods of teaching Irish in the education system, to greatly improve speaking and communicative ability in Irish, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the section that deals with teaching through Irish.  Amendment No. 164<i>a</i> states: &ldquo;In page 27, line 42, after &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of Irish and,&rdquo;.  My concerns relate to the fact that major resources have been invested in teaching Irish, but in general the level of communication in and usage of the language is unsatisfactory. I am seeking that the body which the Minister proposes to establish be given a firmer footing and be called the National Committee on the Irish Language and that its remit be more clearly defined.  That remit would be to examine the methods of teaching Irish in the education system and to greatly improve speaking and communication ability in Irish.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 164<i>a</i> is more fundamental.</P>
      <P>Section 31(1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall establish a body of persons&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to plan and co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to learning and teaching through Irish,</P>
      <P>I am seeking to change this wording to include the phrase &ldquo;to the learning and teaching of Irish and through Irish&rdquo;.  There is a need for appropriate materials for Gaelscoileanna and schools in Gaeltacht areas.  The Minister has addressed the need for materials for teaching Irish.  However, people move to Gaeltacht areas whose children may not even speak English but a European language. Such situations give rise to more specific and difficult problems.</P>
      <P>The aids developed by this body as described in the Bill should be available to all schools.  Is there evidence that the standard of Irish of children who attend Gaelscoileanna is higher than that of children who attend mainstream national schools?  There is quite a high standard of Irish in many national schools.  The Minister referred to the need for materials such as audio-visual aids and books which relate to subjects other than Irish for use in Gaelscoileanna.  These materials should also be available to children in mainstream schools who would be able to understand and read them and, more importantly, benefit from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that we will send out the message that the revival of the Irish language will come through Gealscoileanna.  An impression <Col N="805" /> could be created that the fine work being done in mainstream national schools is not making an equal contribution.  The Oireachtas should not discriminate against children attending mainstream schools.  The parents of many of these children are equally committed to the revival of the Irish language and to the achievement of Patrick</P>
    <P>Pearse's vision of a bilingual society.  I am worried about section 31.  It could be harmful in the long-term as the Oireachtas would be seen to be making specific provisions for Gaelscoileanna and schools in Gaeltacht areas and not for mainstream schools.  This could create the impression that we are giving up the fight in the context of achieving a revival of Irish through mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are given information regarding other developments which may be taking place in Departments.  We should not be divisive in the context of the Irish language as our objectives are similar.  I have thought about this section more than any other in the past few days. I want to see us achieve our objectives as regards the Irish language.  The provision of textbooks and other aids should apply to the entire primary and secondary sectors and not only to Gaelscoileanna and schools in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to amendment No. 164<i>a.</i>  I am a product of the type of schooling system which many people have gone through.  I spent 14 years learning Irish and I cannot understand a news bulletin in Irish.  I studied French for four years and can understand a news bulletin in French.  There is something radically wrong with the way we have taught Irish.  I am going back a long time but the impression I get from my children is that the situation has not radically changed.  Although Irish is taught in a better way, it has not developed to its full potential.  We have a lot to do as regards teaching Irish to those who are not in Irish-speaking schools.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Shea, I am not suggesting that we do not provide curricular material to Irish schools, it is important that we do so.  There is a need for specialist work in this area.  Technical support is necessary if we are to teach Irish, science or geography through Irish.  However, if we want to teach Irish in a meaningful way to people who are predominantly English speaking, we must break away from traditional ways of doing so.  Much of the material which will be developed for Irish speaking schools will be the sort of material which should also be used in English-speaking schools to teach Irish.  Exercises which use geography, history or science as a way of bringing Irish into the classroom in a meaningful way would be more useful and people would see the relevance of such a step rather than spending 40 minutes devoted exclusively to Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting curricular material which would come from this body would have the best chance of addressing the real problem which is improving the retention levels of Irish learnt in school.  The problem is not one of the quality of teaching but <Col N="806" /> the combination of the motivation of students and the material involved.  We have a better chance of motivating students if we come up with new curricular material and new project and exercise work which use Irish.  The remit of this body should not only include the teaching of Irish in Irish-speaking schools but in all schools.  The Minister seems to be supportive of this position and I am puzzled by his decision to withdraw his Committee Stage amendment which was along the same lines.  My understanding of why he has done so is that he believes he can meet commitments in this area through some other vehicle.  I do not know what that vehicle is but it sounds like we may have a parallel body doing similar work.  This would not make much sense.</P>
    <P>There is already some degree of confusion as to what is the remit of various bodies in this area. We have this new body, Comhairle Múinteoirí Gaelanna and others; if the Minister is planning to set up a second body in addition to this one to deal with the teaching of Irish in schools other than Gaelscoileanna, we will end up with a completely Irish solution to an Irish problem.  As Brendan Behan said, &ldquo;the first item on the agenda was the split&rdquo;.  The Minister seems to be building the split in before we even have a chance to form the agenda.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 166, which describes what the body will do, seems to state it will advise the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on matters relating to the teaching of Irish.  The Minister has acknowledged the body will have a role in advising the NCCA in regard to the teaching of Irish but it will not have a role in advising the schools.  That seems to be a very strange hybrid to develop.  If we are going to give the body a role in advising the NCCA, we should also allow it a role in the development of materials for use in ordinary schools which wish to use innovative materials in ordinary classes.  The body should be asked to consider developing materials for such needs.  It is important that the content of this amendment be included in the body's remit and I hope the Minister will be able to accede to it.  It follows from the logic of what he did on Committee Stage and what he appears to be doing through amendment No. 166.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions; I assure Deputy O'Shea that I have thought long and hard about this matter and regret it has not yet been finalised.  Regrettably, division exists across the broad Irish language movement on this issue.  Although various people and groups claim to be supportive of Gaelscoileanna, I detect significant tension in the movement in regard to this whole area.  Between now and the weekend, I have committed myself to having one final round of consultations with the bodies involved.  I have met with Bord na Gaeilge, Comhdháil na Gaeilge and the Gaelscoileanna and my officials have also held several meetings with these bodies.  Each group perceives a threat, whatever approach is outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The fundamental motive behind the establishment of this body was positive.  Under the Constitution, parents have a right to have their children taught through Irish and there is, therefore, an obligation on the State to resource and fund that right.  It has clearly emerged from the Gaelscoileanna movement and from Gaeltacht schools that specific needs pertaining to schools teaching through the medium of Irish are not being met at the moment.  It was felt that it was necessary to establish a body to focus in on those needs, develop strategies to meet them and develop textbooks and curriculum materials for subjects other than Irish in which there is a shortage of publications and resources.  Such concerns have been articulated for quite a long time and were aired in the debate on the Education (No. 1) Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a view that if we were to broaden the body, we would somehow dilute its very specific remit to get to grips with that issue.  I envisage redrafting section 31 to encapsulate the need to develop materials and resources for Gaelscoileanna and the view that whatever conclusions the body arrives at should be extended to the teaching of Irish in national schools.  It was never intended to send out a signal that we were turning our backs on the teaching of Irish in the 95 per cent of gnáth bunscoileanna.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on everyone who is committed to the teaching of Irish, the development of the Irish language, bilingualism and so on to arrive at a consensus on this issue.  There is no point in the Oireachtas or the Minister setting up a body which does not enjoy the confidence of the entire Irish language movement and of everyone involved in the teaching of Irish.  There is a strong possibility that is where we are at the moment.  I do not have to make a decision on this until the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that specific education centres will be set up to carry out research into teaching through Irish and the teaching of Irish.  Deputy Bruton made the valid point that most people have learned Irish to some extent through the second level system but when they leave second level, there is no follow-on.  It is necessary to carry out work into methodologies and so on.  I envisage consulting with the various bodies involved in this area, namely Bord na Gaeilge, the Gaelscoileanna, Comdháil na Gaeilge, the representative body of Gaeltacht schools and the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has a specific responsibility and interest in the matter.  He has also met with the various bodies involved.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible to accommodate the two major issues involved, namely that the body will have teeth and a clear focus on schools teaching through the medium of Irish in terms of the development of resources and that it will develop a remit in regard to the teaching of Irish in national schools.  There is a fear that one objective could dilute the other and the body would <Col N="808" /> not have any specific focus or commitment.  I undertake to consult with the Deputies as soon as possible in regard to the final draft of section 31.  I do not intend setting up two separate bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reassured that the Minister is making a genuine effort and I welcome the fact that he does not intend setting up two bodies. However, he has recognised that there are two tasks involved, namely to provide materials for all-Irish schools and to provide better ways of teaching Irish in other schools.  If the two tasks are to be tackled, that must be done by one body. That logic inexorably leads towards the acceptance of something along the lines of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to believe that the role of this body could be significantly diluted if it also considered the needs of pupils learning Irish.  Many foundation level materials which would be used in Gaelscoileanna could also be used for innovative curricular activity in other schools.  They are not entirely separate tasks although they may have two different objectives, namely to encourage people to take an interest and learn Irish and to teach subjects such as science, geography and so on.  It would be logical to try to achieve some agreement on this matter.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his task.  The Minister of State appears to have very trenchant views on the matter and I would like to be a fly on the wall during the discussions the Minister is planning for next week.  If he is staggering around the corridors next week we will know what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw my amendments and am happy to give the Minister time to reach agreement between the differing interests.  I take it the teacher unions will be part of the consultation process.  I also believe the national parents councils should be part of the process.  It is vitally important in the wider task of restoring the Irish language that all interests are on board in a positive sense and are committed and focused on a clear ideal.</P>
      <P>One of my hopes for TnaG when it was set up was that it would include high quality children's programmes, something which is very important in the context of the Gaeltacht but also in a general context.  Even though broadcasting is not part of the Minister's remit, there should be a focus in this direction.  Television is a very important means of communication in all our lives, but particularly in the lives of children.  From my days in the training college I recall that our capacity to absorb a new language is in decline from five years of age.  The years up to then are vital in terms of children's ability to absorb and retain the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was educated through Irish and studied maths and science, for example, through Irish.  To this day I still have to translate some terms as my focus is on Irish.  My retention of Irish had much to do with the fact that I taught for 20 years and <Col N="809" /> that it was part of my everyday work.  The point made by Deputy Bruton about what happens when children leave school and the outside environment in terms of its attitude to Irish is important.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of consensus and a shared objective I wish the Minister well in his round of consultations and withdraw my amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 166:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A body established in accordance with subsection (1) shall, from time to time, as it considers appropriate, advise the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on matters relating to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the teaching of Irish,</P>
      <P>(b) the provision of education through the medium of Irish, including matters relating to the curriculum for primary and post-primary schools which provide education through the medium of Irish and assessment procedures employed in those schools, and</P>
      <P>(c) the educational needs of people living in a Gaeltacht area, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment shall have regard to any such advice in the exercise by it of its functions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 166, 167, 168 and 169 are broadly similar.  Considerable debate took place on Committee Stage on this matter.  What is involved is the creation of a link between the body established by section 31 and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  There is scope in this relationship for considerable added value in the work of both bodies.  My amendment covers the issues raised in amendments Nos. 167 and 169.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea's amendment proposes that &ldquo;A body established under this section may co-operate with the education authorities and other educational organisations in Northern Ireland in the delivery of support services to Irish-medium schools in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  We strongly support co-operation between educational bodies in this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland as regards <Col N="810" /> education through Irish.  Such co-operation takes place and must be encouraged and I will accept the Deputy's amendment subject to redrafting. What is outlined in the amendment is done in practice in any event.  Recently we had discussions on the matter with the former Secretary for Education in Northern Ireland and with Irish language bodies in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think amendment No. 166 covers the other amendments which have been grouped together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think amendment No. 166 is better as it provides that the body will advise on the teaching of Irish in all schools, the issue which was of concern to us.  Regarding amendments Nos. 167 and 168, there is considerable interest in having some legislative recognition of co-operation and I am glad the Minister is accepting it.</P>

      <P>In page 28, line 25, to delete &ldquo;him or her&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Minister and other persons which the committee deems appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the new section which provides for the establishment of a committee on educational disadvantage.  The committee will be representative and its role will be to advise the Minister on the polices and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. I am seeking that the body not only advise the Minister but also advise such other persons which the committee deems appropriate. The role of the committee, if it is to be meaningful, will be to champion a cause even if it is not always to the liking of the Minister.  It would not be helpful to have all its advice mediated through the Minister.  While its primary role will be to provide information and advice to the Minister which will be incorporated into policy, it should equally have the right to publish its views and inform others of its work and views on developments in the community sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> In relation to tackling educational disadvantage it is important to realise that the Department of Education and Science is extraordinarily absent in its support for most of the community and voluntary initiatives.  My former Department, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, is the pre-dominant means of funding these initiatives through the community employment scheme.  The Minister and his officials do not have a proper window on much of what is happening in the community and voluntary sector and it certainly is not providing the funds to back what they are doing.</P>
    <P>This committee should have a wider brief than simply advising the Minister.  The amendment will ensure that the committee produces a climate of opinion beyond the Department that will help others to have their cases heard.  It will also allow it disseminate best practice and knowledge of successful initiatives elsewhere.  For those reasons, it is desirable that this wider remit be given to the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the idea that underlines this amendment.  Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Education and Science which is in the process of preparing a report on educational disadvantage. A number of people representing different aspects of disadvantage in the education system addressed the meeting.  The common theme in those contributions was co-ordination.  Giving an advisory role to those involved with educational disadvantage should not undermine the position of the Minister.  In fact, it could be practical in the sense that it would give people who needed assistance more immediate access to that assistance than if they had to go through a procedure which involved the Department and-or the Minister. The principle underlying the amendment is an important one and I ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of the argument in favour of the amendment.  We must be clear about the objective of the committee on disadvantage. The primary objective should be to advise the Minister but also that the committee would be effective.  Focus must be retained on this issue.  It is one thing to be a champion of the cause but that does not always necessarily mean action follows or that practical steps will be taken. There is always a danger that if we broaden the remit of a committee like this and allow it advise anybody or issue general statements about the state of education today, it could lose its focus and, to a certain degree, its credibility in terms of policy makers.  I am not talking about myself but future Ministers.  In other words, we want to establish a body that will have a genuine impact on the implementation of policy, the allocation of resources and the strategies to counteract disadvantage. It could be argued that currently there is <Col N="812" /> no shortage of bodies that will issue public statements and give advice to the Minister in respect of educational disadvantage.  There is a raft of State-funded research bodies and many voluntary groups which attract considerable media attention, which is appropriate in a democracy.</P>
      <P>I had hoped this committee would bring a clear focus to advising the Minister of the day.  In other words, the focus would be on the Minister of the day in terms of the policies he or she formulates and implements.  Of course, advice cannot be kept secret.  That would be impossible under the Freedom of Information Act or the Public Management Act so there is no question of a Minister being in a position to withhold any of the advice.</P>
      <P>I realise it may be politically more popular to say we should have a body that simply advises in a general way, but there is a distinction to be drawn between being the champion of the cause and the body that analyses a Minister's position in any given situation, and the restraints he or she is working under, and tries to develop within those constraints an effective strategy in terms of implementing a policy on educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly argue the opposite case.  It has been well established in other areas that the advocacy role accompanies provision of advice and service.  Yesterday we heard consultants saying their role of advocacy requires them to highlight the current issues in Galway in relation to hospital services.  That does not mean they are any less professional or thorough in their work.  Indeed the role of advocacy is a complementary one.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to have a small kitchen committee to help him decide on work in this area; he could have that on a non-statutory basis.  We are talking about giving long-term recognition to the issue of disadvantage, not just setting up a committee of a few people who will have the ear of the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a proper committee dealing with disadvantage, we have to examine models such as the Combat Poverty Agency legislation. Under that legislation, the agency has an independent role.  It evaluates programmes and is involved in activities like piloting and examining all policy proposals as well as monitoring the needs of the disadvantaged.  That more active, independent and meaningful role is what people expect from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of whether the Minister likes it, much of the work done to tackle educational disadvantage developed without the benefit of any money from the Department.  It was carried out by the partnerships and the community employment initiatives.  There is a vibrant voluntary and community sector that does not see the Department as an advocate for what it is trying to do.  If we want to open that up, the Minister has to give them a wider brief than simply setting up a committee <Col N="813" /> that has the ear of the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that there is a plethora of organisations which require co-ordination.  I draw his attention to the wording of the amendment which states that the committee will advise the Minister and other persons the committee deems appropriate.  The amendment provides for the committee to exercise its good judgment.</P>
      <P>If a school or board of management is experiencing a problem, this committee would be aware of resolutions that worked in other areas because of its experience.  When we talk about advice we are also talking about consultation, and the more interaction this committee has with those at the coalface who are dealing with the problems, the better.  I will be happy if the Minister brings forward proposals in the Seanad debate to better co-ordinate this whole sector.  What came out in yesterday's meeting is something I have often spoken of, the need for broader co-ordination in the backup for the disadvantaged sector.  That requires agreement between Departments, but substantial progress will not be made until that kind of co-ordination takes place and that will only take place when there is a statutory desk on which the buck stops.  I saw this when I was an education welfare officer.</P>
      <P>I see this amendment as a flexible touchstone for those at the coalface rather than as a body to be set up in opposition to the Minister or that could issue statements to embarrass the Minister. I know the Minister does not see it in that context. I welcome this initiative but it needs to interface with the players.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. Obviously it would interface with the players, as if it were to advise the Minister it would have to interface.  The group would have to take on the opinions and views of the whole range of partners and organisations.  Those bodies would make up half of the board's composition.  Part of the function to advise involves research, otherwise it cannot advise properly.</P>
      <P>I have strong views on this; I am not being stubborn for the sake of it.  I want to be careful regarding the route we take.  The option of advising the Minister would be better in the long-term for all those who suffer from educational disadvantage. The Higher Education Authority model is a clear example of a body which has been a considerable success.  Its primary function is to advise the Minister on third level education, and university education in particular.  It was established to advise the Minister from time to time and works with the bodies under its remit, and now other third level sectors want to come under its authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What tends to happen is that a body such as that proposed here may decide to stand back from the Minister and publish a report.  We do not want a gulf between this body and a future <Col N="814" /> Minister.  We do not want it to hold back, but the committee needs to have the Minister's ear.  The relationship is important as otherwise a future Minister may not be predisposed towards a body that is just interested in publishing reports and in recommending, for example, that the Minister spend £500 million to remedy ills.  That is not helpful to the Minister; it would be helpful to have a body whose function is on advising the Minister on how to deal with educational disadvantage within his or her context and constraints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to think on this again.  He is being very honest in saying that he wants a group which will advise the Minister and which will, in the words of the next amendment, be conscious of the resources, including financial resources, available.  He wants some of his people who are conscious of his constraints and of the problems he will have in going to the Minister for Finance for approval for his proposals. He wants people to come up with proposals that have a chance of getting the Minister for Finance's approval.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say he wants such a group, but there is no merit in giving it statutory recognition.  With respect, that is what civil servants should be doing for the Minister if they are close enough to the subjects concerned. That is what they are paid to do: to know the constraints and the ways through the various corridors that must be travelled to get agreement for proposed policies.  We are talking here about a committee on educational disadvantage being given statutory recognition, and people feel that this recognition, if it is to be meaningful, signifies a new direction in relation to priorities within the Department.  That cannot be achieved, in the Minister's words, by someone who has the Minister's ear if another Minister pays no heed to him or her.  That would be the worst of all situations.</P>
      <P>Educational disadvantage has been and continues to be a non-mainstream concern of the Department, but this is a watershed.  Some of the most interesting initiatives have grown up outside the Department's funding mechanisms, and the Department needs to stake out and provide leadership for the many organisations doing interesting work on a shoestring in this sector. Many pilot projects are begun, but those pilot projects never become mainstream models for application across the country.  The reason is that the Department has not focused in on and staked out this territory.  I am not pointing the finger at this or any other Minister, but that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been a priority.  When the economy was moving from an underdeveloped point to its present prosperity, the focus was on throughput and on getting more people qualified for the labour market.  However, if this amendment means anything, it means a new departure.  That departure will not be achieved by a group with the Minister's ear and which is conscious of the various constraints a Minister must work under.  A Minister cannot work entirely on his own discretion; <Col N="815" /> he must be conscious of constraints. However, if we mean to give statutory recognition to a committee to tackle disadvantage, it cannot simply be given the role of helping the Minister past various obstacles in his way.  It must have a more long-term commitment and must survive the passage of this brief to another Minister who may not have a particular interest in it.  It must have ground that it can hold, and that will not be achieved if the Minister of the day can screen out the parts of its work he does not like, making it into a meaningless tool.</P>
    <P>The Minister's thinking on the role of this committee is not sufficiently developed.  While he may make use of it, he will not have made a permanent impact with this section of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to accede.  In itself the amendment is only a small step in the direction I am advocating, but it is nonetheless significant, as it would show where this is leading.  That is why I hope the Minister accedes to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>I move amendment No. 172:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The educational disadvantage committee may, as soon as it is practicable after it has been established, and, thereafter, from time to time as it considers appropriate, prepare and submit to the Minister a statement containing &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) proposed policies and strategies for the identification and correction of educational disadvantage, relating to such period as it considers appropriate, and</P>
      <P>(b) the areas of activity to which the committee accords priority.</P>
      <P>(6) In preparing a statement as provided for in subsection (5), the educational disadvantage committee shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the resources, including the financial resources, available, and</P>
      <P>(b) the public interest in ensuring that the resources available are applied in an effective and efficient manner.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aim of this amendment is to provide that the educational disadvantage committee may formally set out its policies, strategies and priorities in the form of a strategy statement.  In terms of a strategy statement we are providing that the committee would have regard to resources and <Col N="816" /> that they would be applied in an effective and efficient manner in the public interest.  That embraces what Deputy O'Shea endeavours to achieve in his amendment No. 174.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment goes some way towards meeting the concerns I expressed on Committee Stage.  My amendment seeks to tighten things up in terms of time but I will not pursue it, bearing in mind the Minister's amendment.  In this area an analysis which moves towards co-ordination and reaches beyond the Department of Education and Science is important.  Some Minister has to take hold of this area.  The resources provided are not achieving as much as they could and would achieve, if better co-ordinated.  I have in mind essentially the support services for families and individuals.</P>
      <P>The one issue the Minister has not included is that a report should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important that Deputies know exactly what is happening in the context of educational disadvantage.  I have stated more than once that the situation is deteriorating.  It is important that Deputies know what is being recommended, the extent of the problem and what the Department of Education and Science intends to do.  In light of the Minister moving substantially in the direction about which I expressed concern on Committee Stage I will not move amendment No. 174.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if Deputy O'Shea moved his amendment because it is better than the Minister's amendment, for more than one reason.  The first reason is that adverted to by Deputy O'Shea that his amendment requires that a copy of this plan be laid before the Oireachtas.  That would ensure it would be in the public arena and available for discussion in the Dáil and in the wider community.  The strategic plan will be a significant contribution to the debate about educational disadvantage.  Referring to the previous amendment, if all of this is done in the privacy of consultations between the Minister and the committee it will not be an inclusive process.  It is far better that the strategic plan be published, in the public arena and the subject of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason is that it does not include the rather insidious term that the &ldquo;committee shall have regard to the resources, including the financial resources, available&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment focuses solely on the need to ensure the &ldquo;most beneficial, effective and efficient use of the resources available&rdquo;.  I fear that under subsection (6)(a) there will be substantial tick-tacking between the committee and the Minister and his Department as to what will be possible and that the committee will be told that &ldquo;having regard to the financial resources&rdquo; means the Department cannot provide more than £3 million this year in a strategic plan to tackle educational disadvantage. Effectively that would stymie the whole operation of the committee. <Col N="817" /> Words such as &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; may seem innocent in a Bill but the legal advice is that if the Department says that financial resources afford £4 million or £3 million to this area, the committee shall have regard to it; in other words it cannot think up plans which would require more than that amount.  Words such as &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; seem reasonable and sensible in that everyone must have regard to financial resources but in this context it means much more than just prudence.  It means, effectively, that the Department and the Minister will be in a position to tell a committee it has £10 million to spend this year and that the committee should not draw up plans to spend more.  This is the type of amendment the Department of Finance would be pleased to have included.  These terms which are speckled through legislation appear to be all right until one tries to do something with them.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment is better.  It provides that the strategic plan will be in the public arena and the committee will not be told it has to be constrained by the realities that may confront the Minister.  I accept the committee must be prudent and cannot seek ridiculous things.  It is aware that if it seeks ridiculous things it will destroy its reputation. I would prefer to support amendment No. 174 which is linked with amendment No. 172.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a look at the words &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; in the Seanad debate.  The other side of the coin is that if committees have no regard to financial resources they lose their credibility straight away as well as any chance of having a meaningful impact in terms of implementation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that will not happen.  I would equally say what the Deputy is suggesting will not happen either.  It is not a case of trying to put people into a straitjacket or constrict them in terms of what they can say.  This is trying to bring back the issue of focus.  Do we want a body that advises society generally on what is needed and what should happen?  It would become an independent body and over time a buffer may develop between it and the Minister and his Department and nothing would happen as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen many reports published.  Policy makers response to reports are to the effect that they are seeking the sun, moon and stars.  As usual the report is put to one side and that is the end of it.  My experience is that the one way to kill any report or advice to a Minister, a Department or the Government, is to look for everything. A committee may say £200 million is required to complete the picture.  It will not decide on what should be chosen but will put the whole menu into the report and allow the Minister and the Government decide.  I am trying to avoid that scenario.  That would not serve anybody's <Col N="818" /> interests.  I am more interested in getting a structure in place that will have an impact.</P>
    <P>This is the first time ever we are establishing an educational disadvantage committee; it was not provided for in the original Bill.  We are trying to give a clear focus from the beginning.  Obviously it is subject to review.  Access to the information is available under the Freedom of Information Act.  We are not saying it should advise the Minister in secret but it will be interesting to see how it evolves.  I do not accept the conspiracy theory on the one side, just as Deputy Bruton would dismiss the conspiracy theory I have just advanced, that there is a danger that a committee that simply advises everybody, loses its focus and its capacity to have an impact on policy formulation and implementation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome modification, if the Minister is willing to do that, during the Bill's passage through the Seanad.  A future Minister could use the words &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; as a vehicle to tell the committee to just advise him or her on its priorities for spending £3 million. We should have a committee which would on occasion say things which might embarrass the Minister and make him push the boat out a bit further.</P>
      <P>Such a change would be of advantage to everyone including, ironically, the Minister in his battles with the Department of Finance and also those who are advocating reform in this area because they would feel they had someone on their side who was not solely a lapdog within the system.  Despite the Minister's arguments, I feel the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Shea, which recognises the need for the committee to prioritise matters, is the preferable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment essentially achieves a strategic approach to this area. The later part of my amendment, to which Deputy Bruton alluded, refers to ensuring that the resources available are applied in an effective and efficient manner in the public interest.  Perhaps I was naive, but I read the reference to &ldquo;the resources, including the financial resources, available&rdquo; as referring to how the resources available in a particular year should be used.  I did not envisage that it could be used as a tool to constrain the committee's plan.</P>
      <P>In regard to placing a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, I take it that it is intended that this body would be added to the list of bodies to which the Freedom of Information Act applies &mdash; or does it apply to this in any case?</P>

      <P>I cannot be definitive about that offhand.  It is not our intention to keep it secret, if that is what people feel we are doing.  I cannot see how such a strategic report could be kept secret. Half the composition of this committee will come from the voluntary groups dealing with disadvantage and it is highly unlikely that any Minister could hand pick 20 people who would remain silent lambs in a society where leaks to the media are the norm.  It would be very foolish of any Minister to think he or she could proceed on the basis of keeping secret a strategy statement produced by a committee on educational disadvantage such as this one.</P>
      <P>In terms of laying the plan before the House, I see merit in the education sub-committee having access to it, being able to discuss it and meeting the committee.  I can deal with that in the Seanad debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 173:</P>
      <P>In page 28, line 49, after &ldquo;schools&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the impediments to education which arise from special education needs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment grew out of much of the debate on this Bill.  There is concern on this side of the House that the Minister's definition of &ldquo;special education needs&rdquo; has been very narrow, in that it does not include specific learning difficulties which are not linked to a physical or mental disability. As a result, there is a feeling on this side of the House that there is a gap in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Similarly, when we come to educational disadvantage we find that the needs of those children who are not disabled in the conventional sense &mdash; they are of normal intelligence but have difficulties with the traditional academic system of instruction &mdash; have not been mentioned.  The educational disadvantage committee deals solely with social or economic disadvantage.  However, a very significant group of people has needs which are not related to social or economic disadvantage alone, although that might be a factor, but are more predominantly related to certain difficulties. There are many conditions, such as dyslexia and attention deficit disorder, whereby children of otherwise normal intelligence find it extremely difficult to relate to the school setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should be part of the remit of this committee or, if the Minister felt it desirable, of an alternative committee dealing with that area alone.  It is not possible to set up another committee by <Col N="820" /> amendment in this House because it would be disallowed for procedural reasons.  However, if the Minister feels it would be better to divide the two tasks between two groups advising the Minister rather than making them both the remit of this committee, I would be quite happy to go along with that.</P>
    <P>However, there is a feeling throughout this debate, which is shared by the wider public, that many children face impediments to learning in school which are not getting sufficient recognition from the Department or in this Bill.  When the Bill is passed such parents will still need to litigate to seek their rights under section 6, in which the Minister undertakes to provide appropriate education.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the Minister receiving consistent advice on the needs of these children which have been overlooked in this Bill.  This is a last chance for the Minister to give half the loaf, if he is unable to give the whole loaf, in response to the concerns which have been articulated on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The sub-committee on educational disadvantage of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science met yesterday.  Evidence was provided to the sub-committee from the residential care sector, to which those with educational disadvantages are sometimes referred by the courts or other agencies.  It seems a high level of people who would be referred to as &ldquo;dull normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo;&mdash; I do not like the terminology &mdash; are referred to such centres.  It struck me as I listened to that evidence yesterday that there is a correlation between educational disadvantage, mental handicap or low IQ and those who are referred by the courts or health boards to such centres.  We cannot deal comprehensively with disadvantage in its broadest context without being mindful of such factors.  The inclusion of a reference to special educational needs in the remit of that committee would give it an added dimension which, in the context of what I heard yesterday, is necessary for it to best discharge the duties that will be given to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this debate on Committee Stage.  I am against bringing the whole area of special needs within the remit of the educational disadvantage committee.  The focus of that committee's remit is educational disadvantage arising from socio-economic disadvantage.  The Bill covers comprehensively children with special needs and it is far superior to the Education (No. 1) Bill in that respect.  We have addressed many of the concerns of groups outside this House who deal or work with children with special needs in education and accepted a number of amendments tabled by the Deputies.  Therefore, I am not predisposed to accepting this amendment on that ground.  We had a long debate on this, but I strongly believe we have provided comprehensively in the Bill for issues pertaining <Col N="821" /> to special needs.  The key issue is resources.  We took a significant step last week in mainstream education by providing child care assistants for national schools to facilitate greater integration and to provide the requisite child care assistants for special schools.  Despite all that has happened through the years and various court cases, until last month special schools did not have the required number of child care assistants. In some instances autism was not officially recognised by the State as an education category. Addressing that area requires decisions by the Minister of the day and resources.  The special needs area requires a specific focus and this Bill could lose focus by concentrating on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister will not accept this amendment.  I can understand why he said tackling social and economic disadvantage and its impact on the education system is an issue that has a precise focus.  I would be quite happy if he agreed to set up an advisory group to examine the wider issue of special needs.  I am also anxious that should include children with learning difficulties who are otherwise deemed normal as well as the Minister's definition of special needs.  We have covered this ground a number of times and the Minister may believe he is catering adequately for this area, but many Members of this House and many people outside it would not agree with him.  They would see a gap in the system that is not being properly provided for.  There is merit in setting up a committee where good expertise would be available to advise the Minister specifically on this complex area.  It would help him to keep abreast of research on the needs of those children if he had such a systematic link with people in that field. We cannot have a rerun of the debates we had on earlier amendments, but I am not persuaded by the Minister's arguments.  By making such a concession, which would not backtrack on what we have discussed already, useful ground would be made in the future.</P>

      <P>In page 31, line 16, after &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, national Irish language organisations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Part VII deals with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  If accepted, amendment No. 178 would have the effect of including national Irish language organisations in the consultation process that would be undertaken prior to the Minister determining the composition of the council.  Section 40 (1) states: &ldquo;The composition of the Council shall be determined by order, made by the Minister following consultation with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.  ..&rdquo;. At that point my amendment seeks to include the national Irish language organisations as one of the groups that should be consulted.  It is regrettable the Minister is not disposed to including organisations representing the disabled as part of that consultation process.  Given the large amount of State resources allocated to facilitating the teaching of the Irish language, it is extraordinary the Minister is not agreeable to consulting those organisations on the composition of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be tensions between the various groups, but tension is often healthy because it can lead to creativity and better solutions.  A formula should be arrived at for consultation with these organisations.  Given that the Irish language constitutes an enormous part of education provision, we cannot allow the composition of a council like the national council for curriculum and assessment <Col N="823" /> to be finalised without the views of the Irish language lobby being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 180, the Minister has indicated that those participating in the national council for curriculum and assessment will be involved at primary and post primary level.  Pre-school and adult continuing education should be included as part of the remit of the body.  I am glad the Minister accepts the pre-school element of my amendment in his earlier amendment No. 179.</P>
      <P>People involved in adult and continuing education should be included within the membership of the group because this would colour the way in which the council develops its work.  The Minister of State will probably agree that the position of adult and continuing education has been seriously downgraded.  There is a need to mend many fences in this area.</P>
      <P>However, part of the problem is that we have a very rigid education structure that does not easily permit re-entry to the system.  It is very much a one chance education system where the system of assessment and certification is solely based on an academic examination, a one-off chance undertaken over a couple of weeks every June.  That militates strongly against adult and continuing education gaining access to the high status certification that the leaving certificate enjoys.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the national council for curriculum and assessment, which will set the standards for school assessment at the end of the school period, will be conscious that it is part of a unified structure where anybody can participate. That consciousness has been absent in our system to date and if we perpetuate it in this Bill by again leaving out the representatives of adult and continuing education the ramparts will stay up and the leaving certificate will continue to be largely inaccessible to those who wish to have a second chance.  There will not be the kind of desired progression and existing turf divisions will continue, which have sadly beset the need for continuing progression through the system.</P>
      <P>Ladders and progression routes are not a feature of our system and it is almost impossible for those who leave school before their leaving certificate to get back into the system.  They are always told why it is so difficult, rather than the easy ways in which it can be done.  There must be much more openness about the system of certification and assessment in the leaving certificate to make it also accessible to those who did not gain the opportunity to advance far in the education system and are now trying to re-enter it.</P>

    <P>While it will not be possible to dismantle the present system in a day, it is very important that the representatives of adult and continuing education be on the curriculum and assessment council. They have a point of view to express, not only about what would be regarded as a second chance and the continuing remit of adult and further education, but also the routes from that into the more <Col N="824" /> formal schooling system and school certificates that are available.</P>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt point to VTOS, etc., as evidence that there are ways back.  There are opportunities for people to get income support while they do courses leading to sitting the leaving certification examinations.  However, that is not the point.  There are few well established progression ladders to enable people gain the same high status qualifications through adult and continuing education that has been accorded the leaving certificate.  If the Minster spoke to people in adult and continuing education, as I have, they would express their disappointment with the progress that has been made in breaking down these barriers.  The Minister has an opportunity to include their representatives in the national council for curriculum assessment.</P>
    <P>I am sure I will have the support of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, because he has given much thought to this.  I am sure he has encountered the frustrations of people with the existing system of linkages and progression in the system. Development of the council will provide an opportunity to stake out some ground for that neglected area.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile amendment.  It will not change the world overnight but it will at least open a window for the views of people whose voices have not been effectively heard.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 179 and 182 in my name take on the broad objectives of amendment No. 178, in the name of Deputy O'Shea, and No. 180, in the name of Deputy Bruton, in so far as the Irish language and pre-school or early education is concerned.  Amendment No. 179 inserts &ldquo;early childhood and&rdquo; while amendment No. 182 deletes lines 26 to 31 and substitutes a new subsection (2)(b), which states at paragraphs (ii) and (iii):</P>
      <P>(ii) have a special interest in, or experience of, the education of students with a disability or other special educational needs, or</P>
      <P>(iii) are representative of Irish language organisations,</P>
      <P>as the Minister considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In terms of the adult education issue, a comprehensive exercise is ongoing under the responsibility of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Dea, in terms of a Green Paper on adult and continuing education.  The Green Paper will be comprehensive and will involve curriculum and access issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also preparing a National Qualifications Bill, which is very advanced and which I hope to introduce in the next session.  In that context it would be inappropriate to take a patchwork approach by including in the national council for curriculum assessment something about adult and continuing education because it does not fit at present. <Col N="825" /> One of the results of work on the Green Paper is that adult and continuing education has specific needs and demands approaches and strategies which are different to those that have been the norm at second and primary levels.  Broadly speaking, to date the national council for curriculum assessment has had its focus on primary and secondary education in terms of curricular reform and so on.</P>
    <P>It is important that we take on board the inputs of all those who have contributed to the Green Paper, including all the bodies that have been consulted and so on.  It would be wrong to pre-empt that exercise by inserting a clause, sentence or phrase on adult education.  In this respect the Deputy will be pleasantly surprised by the content of the Green Paper.  It will contain a number of challenging ideas.</P>
    <P>I accept the Deputy's point, but we have made considerable progress.  Part of the national qualifications framework, which was known as Teastas, is to put progression and quality assurance on a statutory basis.  We should not forget the National Council for Vocational Awards which has done considerable work in providing alternative entry routes to those who left school some time ago and who wish to re-enter second level education or a form of education.  It is assumed that people who wish to return to education have to do the leaving certificate &mdash; they do not have to do that.  The NCVA strategy is to develop a new level of qualification from foundation level up which has links into post-leaving certificate courses and specific vocational qualifications.</P>
    <P>We are moving rapidly in terms of a qualifications framework and in terms of progression. We are going some distance to meet the concerns of Deputies.  In terms of adult and continuing education, it would be better to leave that to the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to hear the point of view of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on this.  It seems it would not be preemptive to include representation for those from adult and continuing education on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  It would be a recognition of a right, and a perspective that should be in this council.  Far from pre-empting the work of the Minister of State, which I have no doubt is very worthwhile, it would be a very useful indicator of the seriousness with which the Minister was taking that work, because the assessment and the curriculum within the conventional education system should be much more aligned to this national structure of certification that the Minister is establishing.  School should not be seen as one thing and adult education as something completely different.  We need to break down such barriers.  While I do not have a readymade resolution of how to do that, I can certainly see that by excluding the representatives of adult and continuing education from the membership <Col N="826" /> of this council the Minister has tied one arm behind his back.</P>

      <P>I very much support what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is doing.  I am certainly not trying to pull the rug out from under the work he is doing.  What I am suggesting is complementary and gives representatives of adult and continuing education a window on a very important part of a high-status element of our education system.  To exclude them from having a voice in that area is a mistake.</P>

      <P>Section 40(1) deals with the consultation process.  At the end of the various categories listed here, there is the catch-all phrase, &ldquo;with such other persons or bodies of persons as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  That gives the Minister a free hand here.  This relates to the consultation process prior to the Minister determining by order what the membership or composition of the council should be.</P>
      <P>My point in putting down two amendments to this section was to ensure that there would be specific mention of organisations representing the disabled &mdash; we have dealt with that &mdash; and that formal recognition would be given to the Irish language organisations.  I am fairly certain that, as part of the consultation process, and under that catch-all phrase, the Minister will deal with these organisations anyway.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment No. 182, which deals with the composition of the council and what the Minister should take on board in determining that.  However, the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; means that there is a qualification &mdash; it is not certain that we will have a representative from, for example, the Irish language lobby or one with a special interest in the area of special needs education.  Both groups will be consulted in the consultation process, but it is important that we recognise them formally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises in the context of the objectives and functions of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The object of the council, as the legislation now reads, shall be to advise the Minister on matters relating to the curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary education.  Even though special education is within the primary sector, I am seeking that special education or special schools be specifically <Col N="828" /> mentioned in this section.  There is a difference between special schools and mainstream national schools.  Children can continue to attend special schools until they reach the age of 18 years.  With the agreement of the Department, they have the option of participating in a further life skills year. Special schools are not excluded, but in the context of the concerns articulated in the House recently about parents of children with special needs, clear reference should be made to the schools which many of those students attend.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 184 states that the council will advise the Minister on matters relating to the need for a special curriculum for students with particular needs including those with special educational needs.  I note amendment No. 188 in the Minister's name states that it will be one of the functions of the council to advise on requirements, as regards curriculum and syllabuses, of students with a disability or other special educational needs.</P>
      <P>This goes a certain distance, but the Minister's definition of special education, which refers to physical or mental disability, excludes all those with learning difficulties but who otherwise have full faculties.  If the Minister intends to reject our amendments, it would be better to include in his amendment some reference to students with particular needs or learning difficulties rather than sticking rigidly to his definition of special needs which hinges on physical or mental disability or exceptional ability.  The problem of this definition recurs in the Bill and affects amendment No. 188 which otherwise addresses the point of my amendment.</P>

      <P>The contributions of Deputies O'Shea and Bruton on an earlier Stage inspired amendment No. 188 which has two main objectives.  First, it provides that the NCCA will have the function of advising the Minister in regard to curriculum and syllabuses for students with a disability or other special educational needs.  Second, it requires the council to advise the Minister on strategies to improve the teaching and use of Irish in schools.  I am advised that in doing so, it takes on board the objectives of amendments Nos. 183, 184, 186 and 187. Therefore, the amendments are not necessary.</P>

      <P>The amendment relates to the functions of the National Council for Curriculum Assessment. There is a need to specifically ensure we do not allow attitudes or a culture to continue in education where certain subjects are seen as more appropriate to boys than girls and <i>vice versa.</i> Changes are taking place and these are welcome. However, the Minister will require continuing advice in this regard.  I ask the Minister of State to respond favourably to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the principle underlying the amendment.  Paragraph (h) states that the council will have a function to promote equality of access to education generally and to instructions in any particular subjects between male and female students.  The issue is to what extent the amendment adds to that position.  It develops the idea that there are certain principles in curricular provision which would make it easier to successfully carry out that task.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment spells out in more detail how this might be addressed.  As such, it has merit and amplifies the existing provisions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I take Deputy O'Shea's point.  What he is attempting to achieve is more specific in relation to stereotyping and certain subjects being considered more appropriate for boys than girls or <i>vice versa.</i>  If the Deputy wishes, I will ask the officials to reconsider this matter between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad.

      <P>&ldquo;51.  &mdash;The Minister shall ensure&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that examinations are a fair test of a student's competence in the subject being tested,</P>
      <P>(b) that examinations are conducted in a way that is equitable to all students taking the exam,</P>
      <P>(c) that candidates are permitted to have their performance in an exam reviewed independently of the marking made by the original examiner,</P>
      <P>(d) that students with special needs are facilitated in so far as is practicable to take the exam.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is remarkable about the section which deals with examinations is that it does not set out what we are trying to achieve with the examination system and what constitutes fair play for those taking examinations.  The Bill creates offences and penalties.  It should also set out what we are trying <Col N="832" /> to achieve with the examination system and what students should expect from it.</P>
    <P>The amendment would require the Minister to ensure examinations are a fair test of a student's competence in the subject being taken; that examinations are conducted in a way that is equitable to all taking the examination; that candidates are permitted to have their performance in an examination reviewed independently of the marking made by the original examiner, and that students with special needs are facilitated in so far as is practicable to take the examination.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the way in which examinations are conducted.  The public is anxious that they are conducted fairly and that where problems arise the Minister will intervene. I fail to understand why this cannot be placed on a statutory basis.  It is expected that the Minister would vindicate the rights of students and take it upon himself to ensure examinations are conducted in an equitable way.  Regulations should be introduced, letters issued to examiners and good procedures put in place.  This function should be underpinned by legislation.  We are moving towards a situation where candidates can expect to have their performance reviewed.  They can now see papers.  No Minister should be able to suddenly withdraw the right of independent appeal.</P>
    <P>The Department has not been seen to be successful when it comes to students with special needs.  Many students seeking to sit examinations believe the obstacles that they face are not taken into account adequately.  As a result of recent changes, examiners will not be notified of a student's particular disability, including dyslexia.  There will be general advice that examiners must take reading and writing difficulties into account.  This is highly unsatisfactory. We know from experience that teachers in the classroom find it difficult to identify pupils with learning difficulties.  It will be far more difficult for examiners to identify such pupils.  This is a retrograde step.  Many are of the view that the changes will undermine the rights of students.  Many fail for the want of proper assessment and diagnosis.  The amendment seeks to set out the rights of students in the examination system which is not perfect.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from briefings I gave the House on the work of the centre on 11 March, 6 May and 23 June 1998, the National Centre for Partnership has been actively engaged in pursuing its work programme in the private and public sectors and this has continued over the past six months.</P>
      <P>In the private sector, the centre has initiated a series of regional seminars on the topic of &ldquo;Partnership at Enterprise Level&rdquo;.  The first was held in UCD in early June and further seminars were held in Cork and Galway during October.  The seminars targeted senior management, union officials and other parties with interest in the topic.  IBEC and ICTU have been active participants in the seminars and the feedback from the seminars has been positive.</P>
      <P>The joint IBEC/ICTU project &mdash; Partnership in Action at Enterprise Level, PACT &mdash; under the EU ADAPT initiative has commenced. Under the project, eight teams have been established on a regional basis made up of management and employee representatives from selected companies, an IBEC executive and a trade union official.  The teams are assessing and surveying their needs and those of the companies involved in order to develop enterprise partnership.  The project will run to the end of 1999, with the objective that the teams will act as catalysts and facilitators for other enterprises in their region.  The centre is liaising with the co-ordinators of the project in order to learn from the experience and disseminate the information.</P>
      <P>The centre has established a computer database containing details on either multi-stranded or single partnership issues existing in enterprises with the intention of monitoring existing developments and expanding as more details emerge via surveys, direct contact and other sources of information available to it.  The identification of a number of enterprises on a cross-sectoral basis where partnership topics are successfully practised will be made easier by access to this database. It is intended that suitable enterprises will be documented and video taped with a view to disseminating their experiences and shortening the learning curve of other enterprises on the partnership path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the public sector, a series of regional seminars were arranged for the Civil Service, local government and health sectors.  These seminars took place in Sligo on 20 October, Cork on 28 October and Galway on 3 November.  A further seminar is scheduled for Dublin on 18 November.  Due to high demand, the centre may schedule further seminars for Dublin and Limerick after this date.  The Irish Productivity Centre is assisting in the organisation and delivery of the seminars.  The audience consists of management, union and staff representatives with the objective of promoting partnership locally and to create a platform for updating representatives on developments in the local government and health sectors in particular.  In addition, a joint National Centre for Partnership/Irish Management <Col N="834" /> Institute seminar on the implications of partnership for management development in the public service was held on 22 September and was well received.</P>
    <P>Many Departments and Civil Service offices have partnership committees in place and the centre is assisting in putting partnership structures in place in the wider public service.  A group has been established, chaired by my Department, consisting of representatives of Departments with bodies under their aegis, the Local Government Management Services Board, the Health Service Employers Agency and the National Centre for Partnership.  Progress is being made towards the wide establishment of partnership structures, with facilitation and assistance from the centre.  The centre is finalising training materials for public sector partnership and it is expected they will be complete within the next six weeks.  These will be disseminated as widely as possible, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It will also produce the first of its partnership bulletins this month.  This will contain a range of information on partnership topics as well as working experiences of various forms of partnership. It is envisaged that five bulletins will be produced between now and March 2000.  As a result of a widening interest, not just in Ireland, in enterprise level partnerships, the centre had discussions with French and Danish groups to exchange experiences.  Further international contacts are being pursued by the joint directors.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Will the centre be involved in the preparations for the forthcoming national agreement?  Which Departments have established partnership committees?</P>

      <P>The centre was born out of Partnership 2000 and its ongoing work will, hopefully, continue to be part of the social partnership process.  Thankfully, it gained momentum this year not just among trade unions but throughout the system, as I outlined.  Most Departments have set up partnership committees or are in the process of doing so, particularly in the local government and health sectors.  That is where the partnership centre is anxious to be involved because they are the biggest areas and it believes that is where it can have the best effect.</P>

      <P>Apart from an extremely large list of domestic and international meetings about partnership, all of which were very useful, has anything practical changed at enterprise level as far as partnership is concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is six months since I answered these questions in the House.  At enterprise level, unions and management are co-operating effectively, with the help of the National Partnership. There are a large number of areas in which companies are working together to solve difficulties concerning rationalisation and modernisation. <Col N="835" /> Some television programmes have reported these developments, showing situations in which management and unions, who were hostile towards each other, are now working together to develop plans.</P>
      <P>This is taking place across the board in co-operatives, manufacturing industries and services. High tech companies are not the only ones which use this practice, it is also taking place in indigenous companies.</P>
      <P>It is not happening everywhere but I hope that the work of the databases and the seminar will introduce this best practice to other companies.  I do not know what proportion of companies are using this idea, but employers and unions who are joining in because they feel part of the centre are driving this initiative in their industries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The Department of the Taoiseach's strategy statement, laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998, sets out the priorities for my Department for the period 1998-2001.  The formulation and achievement of these priorities is an ongoing process as the Department responds to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been made in achieving these priorities, including the successful negotiation of the British-Irish Agreement and its ongoing implementation; the continued implementation of Partnership 2000, including further development of the partnership process and paving the way for a successor agreement; the ongoing development of national policy concerning European and international affairs, with particular regard to ensuring that Ireland continues to play an effective role in the work of the European Council on major issues on the European agenda; and strategy statements for all Departments and offices were laid before the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of business planning and the putting in place of the framework for assignments of responsibilities provided for under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, will be completed by the end of the year.  These measures will provide the basis for the putting in place of an ongoing process of managing performance, based on individual and team objectives at all levels across the Civil Service.  Employment and business at the IFSC continues to grow strongly <Col N="836" /> and a co-ordinated approach to support the centre's long-term development is being pursued.</P>
    <P>My Department's priorities also include the publication of an updated and comprehensive Cabinet handbook; the facilitation of access by the public to information held by my Department, as provided for in the Freedom of Information Act; the implementation of a number of measures designed to facilitate greater co-ordination between the State's legal offices, including the establishment of a study group to consider proposals for a unified prosecution service and a consultative committee to promote greater liaison and communication among the law offices on issues of common interest; the organisation of an extensive programme of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the 1798 Rebellion and the ongoing work on a programme of events to celebrate the new millennium; and the roles and functions of the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum have been reviewed.  Each has a unique contribution to make to the process of social partnership. The National Economic and Social Council had its inaugural meeting on 4 November 1998 while that of the National Economic and Social Forum has been arranged for 12 November. The heads of a Bill to place both bodies on a statutory footing have been approved by the Government and are with the parliamentary draftsman's office.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in 1999.</P>

      <P>As regards the workload of State solicitors, a review of a number of aspects of the service, including the actual and comparative workloads, has been undertaken recently.

        <i>(Mayo):</i> There has been a threat, not a suggestion, on the part of a number of the 32 State solicitors to resign from their jobs.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a high profile fraud and conversion case against a Limerick financial services operator was recently dismissed in a Limerick court because the Limerick State solicitor was unable to prepare the book of evidence in time?  Is he aware that the same solicitor warned the DPP last February that his workload was so intolerable and impossible that a crisis was imminent?  This solicitor had prepared 50 Garda files for the previous November to July.  Some of these cases involved drug trafficking or murder and it was inevitable that cases would be thrown out unless emergency funding was made available.</P>

      <P>A review is taking place on this issue.  The terms of reference of the review are to report on the following aspects of the local State solicitors' services: the actual and comparative workloads of State solicitors and the need for a rationalisation of State solicitor areas; arrangements for meeting the costs of support staff and general expenses; the need for special arrangements for remunerating State solicitors in respect of fisheries cases and any increase in workloads which have occurred in recent years.</P>
      <P>That work is nearing completion and meetings have already taken place with the State Solicitors' Association.  I am sure the report will be followed up once published.  It will be divided into three sections: personal salary, payment in respect of support staff and expenses.  The review will report shortly and the solicitors will have to make their case.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Does the Taoiseach not recognise that a crisis exists and that something should be done pending the review?  Does he not agree that there is not much point in increasing funds for the defence if he does not make a commensurate increase in funding for the prosecution? Does he not see that there is not much point in gardaí doing excellent detective work, arraigning, charging and prosecuting people, only to have the cases thrown out?  There is a large and growing burden of work involving health and safety, sex offences, and agriculture cases, such as the use of angel dust.  It is time we looked at the possibility of appointing State solicitors on a full-time basis so that this work would be their sole occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the local State solicitor service is staffed by very dedicated people and I do not believe many cases are thrown out, although there may be some isolated ones.  Negotiations led to the setting up of a review group and the group's recommendations will be available in the near future.  There is no case for making increases prior to the report of the review group which is already in draft form.  I am not sure what areas have been highlighted most, but the terms of reference set up in consultation with the group will ensure the issues outlined by the Deputy are covered.  The State solicitor from Limerick is a member of the three man review group and I am sure a good case was made on behalf of members of the local State solicitor service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Full details of Prime Minister Blair's forthcoming visit will be announced at the appropriate time.  The focus of the visit will, of course, be his address to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas on 26 November.  Other engagements which the Prime Minister might undertake are currently under consideration.  The Government is looking forward to the Prime Minister's visit which will symbolise the close ties between Ireland and Britain and the unprecedented levels of co-operation we currently enjoy.</P>
      <P>I visited Belfast on Friday, 6 November.  My visit was a community-focused one.  I attended the launch of the West Belfast Partnership's strategy for regenerating west Belfast.  I have arranged for a copy of my speech on that occasion to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Lord Dubbs, the junior Minister at the Northern Ireland Office and Gerry Adams were present.  I availed of the opportunity to compliment all of the individuals and groups involved in researching and formulating the strategy.  I noted the objectives they have set out accord closely with the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.  I commented that those involved in developing and implementing the strategy are working to advance the potential and prosperity of the community, building on the foundations laid by the Agreement.  I also highlighted the importance and potential of the new North-South structures which we are working to bring into existence and which will create new opportunities for increased prosperity for all of us.</P>
      <P>I also took up invitations from two colleges &mdash; Wallace High School in Lisburn and St. Malachy's College in Belfast.  In both cases, I met and addressed the students and participated in question and answer sessions.  I was delighted to avail of the opportunity to interact with these young people of both traditions whose energy and enthusiasm will be essential to the successful implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to visit Northern Ireland again as and when it may be appropriate to do so, including when we are in a position to progress to agreement stage on the North-South arrangements under Strand Two.  I hope this will be the case in the near future.</P>
      <P>In discussions with Republican representatives, I have continued to raise the issue of the disappeared. Like everyone else in the House, I hope there will be a positive outcome and that this will happen sooner rather than later.  I believe progress in this regard would rightly be viewed as a constructive development in keeping with the spirit of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

Are there proposals to expand that list and have there been any responses to attempts to expand it?  The UUP indicated after the meeting that it felt there had been a generalised discussion but that it did not proceed very far.  Was that the Taoiseach's impression of the meeting or is he satisfied actual progress was made?</P>

      <P>I did not refer in my reply to any meeting with the UUP although I answered questions on that last week.  In terms of the implementation bodies, we are working to the Agreement on that.  The broader discussion has moved on.  Many issues have been highlighted in the discussion on the implementation bodies.  When the North-South ministerial council is set up in spring, I hope it will be able to deal with many areas of co-operation.  From discussions which have been held on the non-implementation bodies, I detect that people would be happy to include most Government Departments and other areas in which co-operation could be enhanced.  We have moved away from a position of limiting areas in the general discussion on the implementation bodies.  We are seeking to outline precisely what the bodies' functions will be and how they will interact with existing agencies and Departments.  The bodies should have a focus and a useful purpose.  Rather than having an implementation body in a broad undefined area, we are being forced to spell out the <i>modus operandi</i> precisely.  That has been a useful exercise and the UUP has been very active in this area.  If anything, we are trying to carry the Northern Ireland Office with us in these discussions.</P>

      <P>In terms of the legislative requirements in relation to the implementation bodies, what timeframe does the Taoiseach envisage in regard to the introduction of legislation on the matter in this House?  I understand it will be necessary to have such legislation in place by the end of February.  The Dáil will probably be in recess by 20 December and return some time in mid-January.  The timeframe will be tight.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right.  I emphasised the difficulties that will arise in this regard last Monday week.  My officials have held a number of meetings since then and held conversations with the British Prime Minister over the weekend. We need to agree measures now so that we can proceed with legislation.  While a certain amount of preparatory work has been carried out and is ongoing, we need to achieve agreement prior to the legislative stage.  Ideally, I would like to have legislation drawn up before the end of February.</P>

      <P>In relation to implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, what are the Taoiseach's <Col N="842" /> views on the statement made yesterday by Sinn Féin's chief negotiator when asked why there would be no gesture of decommissioning by the IRA?  Mr. McGuinness said &ldquo;I'll give you a good reason, the IRA will not do it.  That is the reason&rdquo;.  Is this the Taoiseach's interpretation of the IRA's intentions and what are his views in relation to the intentions of loyalist paramilitaries in regard to decommissioning of their weapons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Loyalists and republicans have the same line on this matter.  Even the wording at times in meetings is similar.  Both groups stick to the terms of the British-Irish Agreement.  They say that in the course of the Agreement they will honour it &mdash; I am speaking about what Sinn Féin and the PUP says, not the paramilitary groups themselves.  I hope, as Martin McGuinness said yesterday, the groups will put their energies into working closely with the chairman of the decommissioning body, something I have been urging them to do and which they have been doing. However, work in this regard could be stepped up apace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the fundamental problem with decommissioning is not so much the weaponry or the threat it poses from a military point of view, but the fact that Unionists do not believe republicans do not intend to threaten to use the weapons at some time in the future and that republicans do not believe that Unionists at some time in the future may not try to renege on some of the commitments they entered into in the British-Irish Agreement, and that the deep mutual distrust of each other's intentions is elevating decommissioning from a necessary consequence of any genuine agreement to a barrier to progress?  Does the Taoiseach agree that an engagement between the Unionist and republican leadership is necessary so that some mutual understanding of their intentions can be arrived at, rather than having the sort of megaphone discussion which is now filling the ever-widening gap between their respective positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have urged both sides publicly and privately to try to refrain from megaphone discussion as it is unhelpful to all of us who are in the middle trying to move things forward.  Both sides set out their positions very clearly.  The republican side and the Progressive Unionist Party say they signed the Agreement on the basis that the executive and the North/South Ministerial Council would be set up and that any precondition on anything, not least decommissioning, was not part of it.  In the round table meeting last week they told me they should move forward, that the executive should be established, that ten departments should be designated, that the North-South and implementation bodies should be established and that the other areas of co-operation should be developed.  At the same <Col N="843" /> time the ongoing work of the decommissioning body would continue and the groups would intensify their efforts &mdash; I think they should be doing this now &mdash; and honour their commitment over the two year period.  This is what the republican and loyalist parties have said.</P>
      <P>The UUP says this is in line with what the Agreement states, but that there should be some incremental movement, that movement should not all be in one direction, although provision for such is not in the Agreement.  They say there should be movement on decommissioning over the period and that some of it should happen before the establishment of the executive.  This is not in the Agreement but they say this is the reality.  Even if there was decommissioning other Unionist parties would say it means nothing, that not all material had been decommissioned.  Even if everything was decommissioned, they would say something else.</P>
      <P>Clearly this continues to be an area where we must try to make progress.  I have been endeavouring with some success to convince the British Government, the NIO, the UUP and in particular Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon of the necessity of moving forward the work, that we cannot wait, a point made by Deputy De Rossa.  Things do not &ldquo;go live&rdquo;, as they like to say, until late February but we should be undertaking the other work, something I am currently endeavouring to do. This will not remove the psychological block on both sides.  Deputy Bruton is correct when he says there is a fundamental difference and mistrust between the sides, with one group not preparing to move for fear of being caught by the other side. We must continue to build confidence in every possible way.</P>
      <P>In this session we have had numerous meetings between Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon which have been useful.  However, this has not led to any progression of the matter.  There have been three meetings between the British Prime Minister and Sinn Féin, two with Mr. Adams and one with Mr. McGuinness, which equally have not progressed the situation.  In addition, I have been involved in endless meetings.  We have not found a way forward, but we must continue to keep trying.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the psychological block and bring to the attention of the Taoiseach a newspaper report which speaks of his recent visit to Northern Ireland being an attempt to bring a fresh momentum to the peace process. Accepting &mdash; though not excusing &mdash; the reluctance of Unionists to move towards the formation of the executive and of Sinn Féin and the IRA to give some concession or movement on decommissioning, does the Taoiseach agree that the onus to try to break the psychological block now rests substantially upon his shoulders?  Does he agree that one contribution towards breaking that block would be to signal unilaterally what the Government would be prepared to do in relation to cross-Border bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Does he share the view that unilaterally suggesting the IDA and the IDB should be merged into one body with its headquarters in Belfast and not Dublin would send two very strong complementary signals, one to the Unionist community and one to Sinn Féin and the IRA that would perhaps contribute to a removal of distrust from both sides of the spectrum and enable the other components of the Agreement to fall into place? Has the Government formulated any clear view about cross-Border co-operation of some significance or substance as opposed to the much quoted Foyle fisheries commission which does not get people all that excited?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and am not accusing the Deputy.  However, the Deputy has offered a simplistic view.  He is correct in saying the Foyle fisheries commission will not change anything.  The detail of the North-South bodies and what is contained in the Agreement regarding implementation bodies and North-South bodies has been fairly well fleshed through.  It has been talked through with the parties which have all given their views.  I think and hope they have exhausted their interpretation and views on how it could be worked and what they would agree to.  The areas mentioned by the Deputy are very serious and have been discussed at some length.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Seamus Mallon made a point on the issue he raised and that I have been supportive of Mr. Mallon in that regard.  We have presented position papers on how we envisage it working in terms of marketing, development, etc.  This is very useful and important work but unfortunately it has no effect on the parties when it comes to the other issue as the mindset changes onto another track.  The Deputy can take my word that if we were to agree a range of issues today, it would not move forward the other issue one iota.  There would be an immediate clampdown as soon as it was raised.  I have made various efforts but unfortunately when we raise the issue both the republican and PUP sides say that the Agreement is specific, that there are no preconditions, that they have signed up to a certain course of events, that this is not one of them but they will continue to work with the International Commission on Decommissioning.  Mr. Trimble and his colleagues will say that is fine but they want to see gestures being made.  Regardless of what happens we always come back to that position.</P>

Will he agree that the Republican movement cannot blame the Unionists or the British for this outrageous injustice, that they have only themselves to blame for this injustice which, in some instances, has gone on for more than 25 years?  More than 200 prisoners have been released in Northern Ireland, some of whom were responsible for the most awful crimes, and even Gerry Kelly admits that the pace of release of prisoners is acceptable.  The British Government has indicated that the Maze will close down next year.  Is it not now time that those relatives, who have been prisoners for so long in terms of waiting to know where their relatives are buried so they can give them a Christian burial, were released?</P>

I understand contact was made with many of the families in early summer, some of whom did not want the bodies returned, and I have also met a number of the relatives.  I passed on the information I received from them to the republican movement. As has been stated here before, any assistance the State or the Garda can give to assist in this process will be given.

We have heard more about those who disappeared in Chile <Col N="846" /> in the past few weeks than we have about those who disappeared in our own country.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach urge the Sinn Féin leadership and the republican movement in general to take a more generous approach to the process currently under way? There is a pattern of resistance by the republican movement to normalisation in Northern Ireland. That is reflected in the failure to identify the location of the bodies of those who disappeared, their refusal to move on the decommissioning issue, their efforts to stop a football match going ahead between an RUC team and Donegal Celtic and the refusal of Gerry Adams to accept an invitation from the Chief Constable of the RUC, Ronnie Flanagan, to meet him.  This is a man who has complained for years about this and that person refusing to meet him.  It is clear to everybody that there has been a grudge by the republican movement and that more generosity and forgiveness is needed on their part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.  The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the immediate sale of the barracks, and 60 per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment.  The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place.</P>
      <P>The proposed sales will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial development needs in the areas concerned.  In addition, 15 per cent of the proceeds are to be devoted to community projects in the areas concerned.  This is a consultative process involving many Departments, agencies, councils and organisations, including my own Department.  While there have been preliminary discussions with local community groups, various details and arrangements still require to be sorted out.</P>
      <P>Private security firms will continue to secure the properties and will remain in place until the sale of the properties is completed.  The current contracts will be reviewed after a three month period.  It is not possible at this stage to give a definitive indication as to when the sales will be completed.  However, they will be completed in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
      <P>The costs incurred for private security services up to 6 November 1998 is approximately £51,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this previously the Minister said he would like to see a comprehensive consultation plan being put in place with local communities where barracks are being closed.  What progress has the Minister made on this issue?  Is he having any difficulties <Col N="849" /> on zoning these properties for future sale?  Has he had satisfactory answers from local authorities on the zoning question?  The Minister says he cannot comment on the timescale at present.  Does he envisage private security firms being used irrespective of timescale or will that decision have to be reviewed by the Minister at a later stage? The review of the private security industry has strongly recommended the need for regulation of that industry.  Does that issue concern the Minister? Has he raised the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Does he foresee more legislation in this area?  Is this a prelude to more privatisation of services to the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last question first.  There seems to be a mythical presumption that it is possible to secure valuable commercial sites on a free basis.  Last year the cost of securing barracks in security duty allowances alone was £4.5 million.  The savings arising from the closure of these barracks will be a permanent saving of approximately £0.5 million per year.  It is also important to realise that the activity analysis in the Price Waterhouse review, which relates to the day to day requirements of what the Defence Forces do, brought out a significant finding.  The bulk of the work conducted by the Defence Forces every day consists of housekeeping duties and security of barracks, and the Defence Forces were not then available for operational duties, collective training or United Nations service.  Apart from the inappropriateness of giving soldiers these duties, there would be a significant cost in security duty allowances.  It is not as if there is a choice that means this can be done for free.</P>
      <P>Obviously I will review this position if it continues too long, but I have already had discussions with a variety of groups that I am trying to get together.  In that way we will not get different views from different groups, and there will be a coherent philosophy at local level on what should happen.  The value of the site can be enhanced and it can be put up for public tender as quickly as possible.  Some sites will take longer than others to sell, though I hope the smaller sites can be sold fairly immediately.  The others will involve longer discussions.</P>
      <P>There is some present discussion on legislation to regulate the security industry.  I am happy with the local firms involved, but I do not want them there one day longer than they are needed. However, we must protect these properties from wanton destruction which would adversely affect the sales of very valuable lands.</P>

      <P>The representative associations for the permanent Defence Forces, RACO and PDFORRA, operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme which provides a means for both sides to discuss issues which are of importance to them and to arrive at mutually acceptable resolutions.  The scheme and its enabling legislation also sets out the range of subjects which come within the scope of representation.</P>
      <P>The issues referred to by PDFORRA are specifically excluded by legislation from the association's remit and from the representative process.  Accordingly, I do not propose to make any further comment on the article.  If the Deputy wishes to put down direct questions on the issues raised I will be happy to deal with them.</P>

      <P>I attended the PDFORRA conference in Cork and saw the reaction to the Minister. How many meetings have taken place with PDFORRA since then?  In addition, how does the Minister see morale in the Army Apprentice School in Naas, given that the school has now moved to the Curragh for all intents and purposes? The teachers in the school have not even seen where their workplace will be or what their conditions will be like.  They have not been to the Curragh yet to see the facilities.</P>
      <P>The specialist staff in the Curragh have been moved to facilitate the relocation of the school within the Curragh camp.  How does the Minister view their morale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are meetings this week to try to resolve the problems of teachers employed in the apprentice school in Naas.  There has been significant expenditure to improve the infrastructure in the Curragh to take account of the influx of these students.  I met one of the parents last Sunday at the medals ceremony, and they were very happy with the food and accommodation, which is very good.  However, there are outstanding issues to be resolved.  I have given a guarantee that they will be able to complete their course within the timespan.  We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that that happens.  In the science and technology area there is no problem but there are problems with some of the trades.  I hope to resolve the outstanding issues which <Col N="851" /> relate to the teaching profession in Naas.  Meetings have been arranged and teachers will visit the Curragh to view its facilities.</P>
      <P>So far as PDFORRA is concerned, there has been no request for meetings.  There was a phenomenally strong vote for the new pay deal which I negotiated with them and they appear to be happy with much of what is taking place.  If I receive an invitation to discuss any outstanding issues I will consider it.  I would like to see them put forward a more credible performance particularly in relation to the White Paper.  I am saddened they have such a negative approach.  It is bad for the Defence Forces.  There are opportunities for expansion and development on every front &mdash; including pay, infrastructure, United Nations service and general development &mdash; and I would like the representative associations to be more directly involved.</P>

      <P>Is not the opposite the case, that the Minister should take the initiative?  Surely he is not waiting for PDFORRA to lead the direction of the Defence Forces.  Given the opportunities for various initiatives, surely it is the Minister's prerogative to meet with PDFORRA to clear up any problems and to put in place a system whereby PDFORRA can act responsibly with the Department and the Minister to reach the projections, to which he has referred.</P>

This is a real opportunity to become involved in the Defence mission for the future.  On receipt of that submission there will be an opportunity to discuss with PDFORRA and other stakeholders who make an impact in this area.  I repeat what I said in Ennis &mdash; one does not normally try to insult oneself into a meeting.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the cost to date of deafness compensation claims including legal, administrative and compensation; and if he will establish a tribunal to deal with these claims in view of recent Supreme Court decisions.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23131/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts paid out to date are: £2.04 million in respect of 124 court awards; £41.5 million in respect of 1,745 out of court settlements; and £12.25 million in respect of 1,401 claims where legal costs have been paid to date. The total cost to date is close to £56 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately: £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State <Col N="852" /> Solicitor's Office.  A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, £2,395,000 per year.</P>
    <P>With regard to proposals to establish a compensation tribunal, I am most anxious to ensure that genuine cases of hearing disability are compensated as speedily as possible, and I believe the most effective way of achieving this is by way of some form of out of court settlement procedure. This has been a long-standing position of mine. Following the judgment in the first Green Book test case in May last &mdash; Greene <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence &mdash; I had hoped that proposals could be brought to Government for approval to establish a compensation mechanism outside the courts. However, the outcome of a second case in July &mdash; Hanley <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence &mdash; brought huge cost implications to bear on this proposal.</P>
    <P>The recent Supreme Court decision on the case of Smith <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence and Others, while very welcome on a number of counts, has not overturned the Hanley jurisprudence or the tariffs which that case has applied to Army hearing loss compensation claims generally.</P>
    <P>The Hanley case is being appealed to the Supreme Court and the question of establishing a formal out of court mechanism will be considered again following the determination of that Supreme Court appeal.  In the meantime I have instructed officials in my Department to endeavour to settle claims informally on an out of court basis where reasonable discounts can be obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate there is a stand-off in the relationship between the Minister and PDFORRA given the scale of the problems that need to be resolved, including the deafness compensation issue in relation to the Defence Forces. There were a number of cases last week, including a Supreme Court decision which has implications for the Green Book.  The Supreme Court statement said serving in the Defence Forces, even if protection had not been used, did not necessarily mean compensation should be given, that the cause and effect would have to be proved. In light of this, has the time come to end the reliance on the courts system and begin negotiations to establish a tribunal?  Given that the awards have dropped significantly in the courts and that the Green Book seems to be accepted in the courts system, has the Minister all the elements required to begin negotiations to establish a tribunal to deal with this issue?  How many more cases does he intend to appeal before making this move?  I understand there are at least 11 cases on appeal to the Supreme Court.  For how long does the Minister intend to continue the reliance on the courts?  Has the Minister made a decision on that and is this the appropriate time to move from the courts to an alternative system? The administrative and legal costs would be saved if there was a tribunal.  At what point will the Minister move to a system which everyone, including the Minister, agrees would be a better way of managing the huge demand on the <Col N="853" /> Exchequer and allow a fair system for claimants who have genuine hearing loss?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no stand-off between PDFORRA and myself but there is a significant difference of opinion.  I do not believe the ordinary taxpayer or the welfare of the Irish community is defended properly when people with little or no perceptible disability are awarded high damages in the court or out of court, which draw on funds desperately needed for other areas.  So long as PDFORRA defends that right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am on the other side, as I have to be.  There are 17 cases pending appeal to the Supreme Court.  I am anxious to save on the legal side.  That is why I began the pilot scheme. Notwithstanding the Hanley case, and the Johnson decision is in it, which had terrible repercussions in terms of the overall cost of the claims, I am in a position to establish a tribunal &mdash; which I dearly want &mdash; only when the tariff for the minor disabilities reaches affordable levels, which it has not done.  I agree it has come down on average from £35,000 per claim in 1995 to a little over £16,000 in the middle of this year.  After the Hanley case, tariffs have increased to over £20,000 but are beginning to taper down following the Smith case.  I need a few more positive decisions to help us get into the position of establishing the tribunal. I am not waiting for that to happen on the pilot scheme where there is an indication of cost savings to the Exchequer.  I have been told, both formally and informally, by the solicitor firms representing the plaintiffs that they want to negotiate and help us make savings.  We are in that process with a number of firms.  Side by side with what is happening in court, there is an out of court environment I am trying to operate with some disability because of the Hanley judgment. I am moving as quickly as I can towards that kind of scenario.</P>

      <P>I have not held any discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the holding of joint exercises between the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  Neither have there been discussions at official level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is constant liaison between the Defence Forces and the Garda concerning all matters relating to aid to the civil power operations.  The question of holding joint exercises is an operational matter and is, therefore, one for arrangement <Col N="854" /> between the Garda authorities and the military authorities.  Aid to the civil power exercises have taken place in the last year which have included personnel from the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 the Government laid down new roles for the Defence Forces, one of which was the aid to civil power which involved assisting the Garda as and when requested.  If this is to be carried out in a professional manner it is important both forces combine regularly on various exercises.  Will the Minister agree there is a gap in the training and will he seek to address it?</P>
      <P>I am afraid that, while the Minister puts a great deal of work into the deafness claims and the reorganisation, the day to day running of the Defence Forces is being neglected.  One of the main reasons for the decline in morale is that members of the Defence Forces are preoccupied with just two matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the contention by Deputy Timmins that the day to day operations are being neglected.  He should not make me reel off again all the positive things I am doing which his party was unable to do when it was in office. However, let us leave that aside for just one day.</P>
      <P>There is constant liaison between the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces but it is done on a discreet basis.  There have been various meetings between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff about related matters.  We have received no complaints from the public or the services about a breakdown in any area.  There has been tremendous support on all sides when it has been called for.  The best example is the task force on drug interdiction, where the Naval Service, the Garda and the customs service have worked together tremendously well with very good results.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy Timmins, with all his experience, does not recognise these positive developments but instead is lurking in the dark of the past.  He should not worry about morale &mdash; morale will always be down a bit when two out of five of the permanent members of the Defence Forces have claims against their Minister and when hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' funds must be spent daily in the courts to meet claims which have no parallel anywhere else in the world.  It is very hard to expect a force to have a high morale when that is happening.  We will raise morale wherever we can.  However, if we fail to manage the problems related to the deafness claims not only will they hurt us now, they will haunt us for decades to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of FCA applicants refused due to hearing failure and the relative percentages for each of the former Commands are as follows: Eastern Command, in the period of 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1998 &mdash; 216 examined, nine failures, giving a failure rate of 4.2 per <Col N="856" /> cent; Southern Command, in the period 1 September 1997 to 31 August 1998 &mdash; 714 examined, 198 failures, giving a failure rate of 27.8 per cent; Western Command, in the period 1 September 1997 to 31 March 1998 &mdash; 950 examined, 33 failures, giving a failure rate of 3.4 per cent; and the Curragh Command, in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 August 1998 &mdash; 144 examined, 19 failed, giving a failure rate of 13.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Southern Command failure rates fell towards May but then increased.  However, the total number examined in July and August was six and eight respectively, and so cannot be taken to be statistically significant or indicative of a trend.  The rates over 11 months are as follows: October 1997, 33 per cent; November 1997, 26 per cent; December 1997, 20 per cent; January 1998, 41 per cent; February 1998, 27 per cent; March 1998, 49 per cent; April 1998, 25 per cent; May 1998, 12 per cent; June 1998, 17 per cent; July 1998, 17 per cent; and August 1998, 25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister being serious when he says that three commands have a failure rate of approximately 4 or 5 per cent and the Southern Command has a failure rate of more than 27 per cent?  Does he agree there is something dramatically wrong in the south?  Why is the south different?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Some medical reasons were put forward for this.  When I received the figures the Southern Command seemed to be extraordinarily different, as the Deputy pointed out.  I gave each applicant who failed an opportunity to be retested.  Twenty seven of the 198 who had failed returned, 23 of whom then passed, which is a significant number.  I am not in a position to indicate to the Deputy what would have happened if the other failed applicants had been retested &mdash; perhaps they went for other tests and found they were below the norm.  However, a significant number of those who returned for testing passed. I do not know whether there was a flu epidemic at the time but the statistics were wrong &mdash; they were medically correct on the day they were done but could not be sustained over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, those 27 per cent were tested over a number of months, according to the Minister's reply.  Therefore, it was not just one snapshot in time and could not be due to an epidemic. An epidemic does not usually last for 12 months.  Did the Minister write to all those people and invite them to be retested or did they come back of their own accord?  If the Minister has not written to them would he be prepared to do so, given that, by his own admission, there was something glaringly wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it a fact that applicants must take time off work, school or college to be tested?  Does the Minister consider it fair that people who are joining a voluntary organisation and want to serve the State must take time off work, school or college <Col N="857" /> for medical tests?  Will he examine the possibility of holding these tests in applicants' free time at weekends, on nights or during parades in order to facilitate people?  This is causing grave hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be easy to say here in the House how the tests could be done at different times because there are many specialists and facilities involved.  However, I undertake to look at it.</P>
      <P>It was my understanding that every failed applicant was invited to be retested but I am not in a position to guarantee that happened.  I will see whether a further option could be given to people within the age limits.</P>
      <P>There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the test itself because the tests of the applicants for the permanent Defence Forces were statistically aligned with the national position at that time.  There was no question of a lack of sophisticated equipment and so on but it was shown that there were some extraneous reasons for the failure when 23 out of 27 applicants succeeded when they were retested.  I do not know what those reasons were.</P>
      <P>We will try to accommodate the points made by the Deputy, but without commitment or guarantee because there are some other related issues which may not be easy to resolve.  As the Deputy knows, there is terrific demand on those services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 37, 96, 155, 165 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years, considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote for new weapons, transport and communications equipment and on providing new and upgraded living and operational accommodation for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Some of the more important developments in the improvement of Defence Forces' equipment are: a new fishery patrol vessel, due for delivery in 1999; the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Panhard armoured cars &mdash; the first two turrets and two fire directing systems will be delivered in December 1998 and fitted in January 1999 and the balance will be delivered and fitted in the fourth quarter of 1999; the purchase of two batteries of refurbished 105 mm light artillery guns to replace &ldquo;25 pounder&rdquo; guns which are now obsolete &mdash; one battery, equal to six guns, was delivered in May 1998 and the other battery in June 1998; delivery, in December 1998, of the final instalment of equipment to complete a major programme to provide new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces at a total cost of approximately £10.5 million; and expenditure this year of approximately £3.5 million on new troop carrying vehicles, such as four by four three-quarter tonne trucks, buses, motor cycles and ambulances.</P>
      <P>The programme to procure 40 armoured personnel carriers over a five year period is now well under way.  A project team was established in 1997 comprising civilian and military personnel and was tasked with identifying the most suitable type of APC for the Defence Forces, the numbers and variants required and the estimated costs involved.  The procurement process will be undertaken in two stages by way of a tender competition which will be conducted in accordance with Government contracts procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In stage one a general request for proposals based on a broad parameter specification was <Col N="859" /> issued to interested companies on 24 April 1998 with the aim of establishing product availability in the marketplace as well as an indication of the costs involved.  Proposals were received on 27 May 1998 and are being evaluated at present.  In the second stage, which will commence shortly, a request for tenders based on a more precisely defined specification will issue to a restricted list of companies &mdash; those deemed successful in the first stage.  The project team, already in place, will manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.  It is expected that a contract will be in place early in 1999.</P>
    <P>Requests for participation by the Defence Forces in international peacekeeping missions are considered on their merits by the Government on a case by case basis.  Where a decision is taken to respond to any such request the military unit concerned will be provided with the equipment necessary for the carrying out of its mission.  The Defence Forces are currently participating in a number of overseas missions involving a total of approximately 750 personnel and troops serving on such missions are provided with adequate resources to carry out their tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in equipment for the Defence Forces.  Is the Minister satisfied that adequate equipment is available to the Defence Forces for future requests for peacekeeping missions?  It is increasingly expected that those participating in peacekeeping missions will bring their own equipment and that it will be the most up to date available.  I welcome our involvement in Kosovo.  While Kosovo may not be the best example to use, is the Minister satisfied with the equipment that is available there? Is he determined to ensure our troops have the necessary equipment so that they can participate in an appropriate way in peacekeeping missions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not supply any weapons or equipment in Kosovo.  We will have an observer status and our personnel will accredit what is happening there.  In terms of what will be required of our personnel in the future, there will always be conflicts, a need for crisis management and intervention by the UN.  It is important we ensure there are improvements in our equipment to enable us meet those demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the return on investment in the voluntary early retirement scheme, in terms of the 50 per cent of savings that will start to accrue next year which was agreed with the Department of Finance, begins to flow back, it will provide a further opportunity for investing in the type of equipment that will be necessary to support intervention on the international front under the United Nations banner.  In a span of three years we have doubled the amount of capital invested in equipment and that is beginning to have results in terms of what is happening.  We are building from a relatively low base and much more needs <Col N="860" /> to be done.  We will not have unlimited funds, but it appears we will have a further opportunity to enhance our position as the funds from the success of the voluntary early retirement scheme begin to flow in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied there will be a drawdown of those funds next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the final stages of negotiations on the Estimates.  We have no particular difficulty in meeting our targets in this regard.  When we need to purchase equipment we have to negotiate our case with the Department of Finance.  It is not the case that we can spend money on it because we have it, we must be satisfied it is required for a real need and the planning for that has not begun.  We will discuss it as matters progress over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no application with the Department.  I am considering the prospect of having some negotiations with at least one of my partners in the Union on an arrangement to deploy Irish troops to provide services which are at present being provided by personnel in another country under an existing commitment.  It would involve a transfer of personnel from one operation to another.  That is necessary because our troops have been in South Lebanon for 20 years and we have to consider alternative ways to continue to attract people to become involved in the Defence Forces.  This proposed arrangement is at an early stage and I would not like to indicate to the House that it will work, but I hope we will be able to make progress.  I will inform the House as matters progress whether that will prove possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more precise as to when tenders will be issued for APCs? I note he said in reply to an oral question on 1 October that the position had not moved forward. During his recent visit to Vienna did he raise with his fellow EU Defence Ministers the matter of the various equipment in the Army?  In view of the recent comment made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we might consider joining Partnership for Peace, is the Minister satisfied that the necessary steps are in train to address our equipment needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="861" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a strong statement that joining Partnership for Peace is under constant review, but it is too early yet to make formal decisions.  The Deputy can rest assured that when I represent this country in my humble way in Vienna or elsewhere I do not let the Defence Forces down in terms of any equipment they have.  I do not discuss any disadvantages we may suffer in that regard.  I have to try to remedy those and no one else can help in that regard.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question on APCs, the contract will go to tender early in the new year.  The identification of our needs in this area and gathering all the relevant information has proved to be a tedious operation.  It is the first time in a long time we have undertaken such a major project.  What we buy must satisfy our needs for a considerable time into the future, therefore, it is important to get it right.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that a delay of a few months in the contract going to tender will not make much difference and that it is much more important to get matters right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a poor response to that proposal when it was raised in the context of a discussion by at least one of the associations representing the Permanent Defence Force.  That surprised me because we were discussing preliminary proposals. Reliance on the Reserve Defence Force to supply certain needs and facilities in terms of the United Nations is an ordinary procedure in most countries.  Because the people who make up the Reserve Defence Force have permanent jobs they are not available to participate in missions.  However, where such personnel have a special expertise, which may be required at times when there is a shortage of personnel with such expertise in the Permanent Defence Force, it is logical to combine the two forces and to have realistic discussions about it.  That would not take from either side because there is a need to view the Defence Forces as a whole and to take advantage of strengths within the Defence Forces.  We will discuss this matter with representatives of the various associations as time progresses.  I would like to see that happen even though there would be a very limited requirement for such reserve personnel.  It would be good for the Reserve Defence Force to make such an input.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 34, 40, 48, 78, 89 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Austrian Minister for Defence I attended a meeting of Defence Ministers of the members states of the EU in Vienna on 3 and 4 November 1998.  I was accompanied by officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The invitation from the Austrian Minister was extended in September of this year.  Austria currently holds the Presidency of the EU.  The meeting, a once-off and informal event, was non-decision making in character and was held outside the institutional framework of the EU.  No decisions or conclusions were reached and no final document was, therefore, produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence Ministers of all 15 EU member states, including of course the EU neutral states, attended as well as the Secretary General of the Western European Union.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the meeting and to indicate Ireland's approach to the issues raised. Discussions focused primarily on the development perspectives of European peacekeeping and crisis management with emphasis on the practical <Col N="863" /> effect of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  This reflected a recognition that the need to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, such as those that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia, is the current key security challenge facing the UN and the international community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I found this an area of great interest and importance for Ireland in view of our strong commitment to European integration and in consequence of our long history of support for peacekeeping operations.  These two fundamental concepts are brought together in Ireland's readiness to contribute to the Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis, as is our right in accordance with our observer status at the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>On the basis of our voluntary and long peacekeeping experience, Ireland is ready to make a continuing contribution to strengthening the international community's conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities and I made this known during the course of the meeting. Ireland has, along with our fellow neutral EU member states and many other non-NATO states, moved into a new dimension of regional peace keeping through our participation in the stabilisation force in Bosnia.  The Vienna meeting provided a timely opportunity to share experiences in the peacekeeping area with those other countries with which we have much in common.</P>
    <P>A success of the Treaty of Amsterdam is that it maintained a unified approach to the common foreign and security policy, in that all member states, including the EU neutrals, could participate in the Petersberg Tasks.  Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to implement the new provisions on peacekeeping and crisis management, which were the result of lengthy negotiations in the intergovernmental conference leading up to the treaty.</P>
    <P>It can be said with some certainty that the Balkan conflict and the lessons drawn from the recent terrible events in the former Yugoslavia were the backdrop to the Treaty of Amsterdam and the treaty's provision in relation to the Petersberg Tasks were aimed at giving the EU capacity to deal more effectively with this type of crisis.  As I said earlier, Ireland has indicated a willingness to contribute to the Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from what I have outlined, the focus of the meeting was firmly in the area of peacekeeping and crisis management.  My contribution to the discussions was in that context.  As can also be seen, the issue of Ireland's policy of military neutrality was, therefore, not an appropriate matter for discussion.  That Ireland is not a member of any military alliance and has no plans to join one is a fact and is well known to all other countries which participated at the meeting. Apart from the aforementioned discussions which took place during the course of this meeting at Vienna, I have had no other discussions regarding <Col N="864" /> the role of neutral states in the EU with neutral member states of the Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are ongoing on all these arrangements.  In this instance they commenced immediately after the invitation was issued.  I have had no discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, since I returned nor do I anticipate any discussions that would create problems between us arising from the meeting, which dealt with the circumstances of peacekeeping and crisis management. These are vital to the international community and are evolving in a way that not only incorporates military issues but also multifaceted aspects, such as humanitarian and educational aid and early intervention.  It is a question of learning how to do these things in the best way to give security to people and to avoid the terrible problem of refugees, which usually arises when conflicts are not resolved and when, in consequence, people have to leave their homes and communities. There are no difficulties between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's involvement in the meeting.  It has presented a good opportunity in an informal setting to discuss European co-operation on the issues he has outlined. I understand from reports of the meeting that a number of the participants said they would like more informal meetings of that kind and that there was a range of initiatives discussed, including the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the EU's slowness in responding to some of the humanitarian crises we have seen.</P>
      <P>Was the Minister one of those who supported the idea of further informal meetings like this?  A number of areas were discussed, such as a joint mutual exercise and the very poor information shared between Defence Forces at European level.  Does he envisage initiatives arising out of the meeting within which the Defence Forces can be involved and will he act on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters are dealt with primarily by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not envisage regular meetings of this kind. However, the meeting was very useful and I imagine that over a period of time there will be further meetings of this kind, which are not conclusive but are opportunities for people with expertise, especially in the defence area, to communicate better about the type of arrangements they are capable of putting in place to deal with peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given our long experience in peacekeeping and the fact that we have been in 30 countries and have participated in many individual missions, we have gathered much experience, not just on the <Col N="865" /> military side but often in handling circumstances in an impartial and diplomatic way.  This enables us to have a significant input into how these circumstances can be managed properly.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of the slowness with which intervention is made at times.  Sometimes intervention is too late.  While special circumstances preclude generalising on the issue, the world community expects early intervention of an expert kind which can avoid the trauma, tragedies, loss of life and the dispersal of peoples from their homes in the way that has been experienced in parts of the world in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is very important that Europe is seen to intervene effectively in these humanitarian crises.  Does the lack of a decision by the Government on Partnership for Peace not inhibit our involvement in these missions and was this not obvious at the informal meeting of the Defence Ministers in Vienna?  Is there not a need to move on the question of Partnership for Peace if we are to be appropriately involved in the kinds of initiatives which were discussed in detail at the meeting and which would mean more effective intervention where there are humanitarian crises, such as Kosovo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is under review and I understand there will be a debate in the House, which is being arranged by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It is important, however, to realise that we are stretched to the limit in terms of our capacity to meet our existing demands in the UN.  It is not as if there are many other opportunities we can take up, given our present commitments in SFOR, Cyprus, south Lebanon and a host of other places.  We are not restricted.</P>
      <P>Should we decide to join Partnership for Peace in the future, there will be opportunities for extending military capacity.  There will be training opportunities and other experiences which are necessary for a developing defence force and which have a role in building up morale and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister effectively have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to our further involvement in a number of the initiatives which were suggested at that meeting because, as a country, we have not taken a decision in relation to Partnership for Peace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has answered some hypothetical questions, I will ask another.  If we do go on to join the Partnership for Peace, has the Minister examined the feasibility of setting up a peace corps or brigade separate from the present organisation, because this would require much more commitment than the <Col N="866" /> peace-keeping duties in which we are currently involved?</P>

On this occasion let us wait to see how the debate develops and what answers are given.  The Deputy can more appropriately put a question of that character at that stage.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 64, 67 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 24 personnel who served with the 83rd Infantry Battalion are currently serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My address to the PDFORRA annual delegate conference in Ennis on 8 October 1998 was wide-ranging and covered many issues.  One of those <Col N="867" /> issues was overseas service.  I made the point that if significant problems were to arise in fulfilling our obligations in UNIFIL, we would have to pull out of Lebanon.</P>
    <P>However, I am delighted to report that there were no problems with the numbers of volunteers for the 84th Infantry Battalion which departed at the end of October for service with UNIFIL.  All positions in the battalion, with the exception of a cook, were filled by the rotation dates.  For the first time in years, there is a waiting list of privates to serve in Lebanon.  This is a testimony to the Government's policy of ongoing continuing recruitment of the Defence Forces.  I thank the Deputies who tabled these questions which enabled me to again outline the progress we are making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the fact that 24 personnel from the previous battalion are serving with the current battalion not indicate that there was a shortfall in the number of volunteers?  It was not normal practice for people to stay for two consecutive terms.  That practice evolved when there was difficulty in getting volunteers.  Would the Minister agree that the situation may not be as rosy as he paints it?</P>

      <P>Nobody knows better than Deputy Timmins the average numbers that rotate on two consecutive battalions, varying between 50 and 90.  That the number is down to about 24 means that quite a number would like to have stayed on but there was no space for them because of applications arising from the continuous recruitment in which we have engaged, the first time any Government has done this for many years.</P>

That will continue to be evaluated so that the numbers remain as programmed for in the implementation plan.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Wall &mdash; perhaps he was not present in the House when I dealt with the matter &mdash; I was disappointed at the initial reaction to the proposal.  Bearing in mind that the reserve force, having permanent jobs at home, would not normally be available for United Nations service over the protracted span of time that would be required, where there are deficiencies in specialities in the Permanent Defence Forces, we will look to see to what extent the reserve force could meet our commitments. I would like to continue that exercise, bearing in mind that all aspects of the Defence Forces form a full circle, and make the best possible effort both at home and away to fulfil our mission as representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins is right in what he said.  There is a provision, but it is not exercised.  We have always depended on voluntary endeavour.  We will continue to rely on that because it works.  I have no knowledge of problems with specialities. In the beginning there are always some, but as the rotation date approaches such problems tend to be resolved in one way or another.</P>

From time to time there are problems in relation to different specialities.  Greater numbers are leaving to take up other jobs, particularly highly qualified people who are attracted by the growth in the economy as a whole.  An opportunity on one side presents a challenge on the other.</P>

    <Title>Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 195:</P>
    <P>In page 35, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;51.  &mdash; The Minister shall ensure&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that examinations are a fair test of a student's competence in the subject being tested,</P>
    <P>(b) that examinations are conducted in a <Col N="870" /> way that is equitable to all students taking the exam,</P>
    <P>(c) that candidates are permitted to have their performance in an exam reviewed independently of the marking made by the original examiner,</P>
    <P>(d) that students with special needs are facilitated in so far as is practicable to take the exam.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy R. Bruton).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks the inclusion of a new section in relation to examinations.  There is merit in the Deputy's suggestion in the context of students with special needs.  This area cannot be overstressed in the legislation, not only from a statutory point of view but also in terms of underscoring the House's commitment to facilities for people with special needs.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of the amendment states that the Minister shall ensure that examinations are a fair test of a student's competence in the subject being tested.  This resurrects the debate on dys-lexic students and what provision should be made for such students when they are sitting examinations. I have misgivings about the proposal for this year.  When the examination papers of such students are being corrected it is necessary, to ensure fairness and equity, that the people marking the papers are fully aware of the various difficulties experienced by students with the condition. The bottom line is that the students' knowledge should be tested, as the amendment suggests, in a fair way.</P>
      <P>Nobody could have any problem with paragraph (b) of the amendment which states that examinations should be conducted in a way that is equitable to all students taking the exam.  Paragraph (c) states that candidates should be permitted to have their performance in an examination reviewed independently of the marking made by the original examiner.  In the context of an appeal, if fairness and equity are to apply, the paper should be evaluated in full by someone other than the original examiner.</P>
      <P>It may appear on the face of it that the amendment is stating the obvious to some extent. However, it is worth including so it is clear that there is a commitment to fairness, equity and a proper appeals system in terms of papers which are re-evaluated.  Most importantly, it would be clearly stated in the context of examinations that the special needs of students will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the case made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Shea.  While I understand the logic of their arguments, I do not intend to accept the amendment.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment is unnecessary and would be in any case very difficult to provide for in legislation.  Paragraphs (b) <Col N="871" /> and (d) relate to equity and, in particular, to special needs.  They are encompassed by the existing paragraph (b) which provides for the making of regulations relating to procedures at places where examinations are conducted.  This will include procedures relating to students with special needs.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (c) provides for a statutory basis for appeals which would be independent of the original examiner.  This is covered by the existing paragraph (f) in section 51 which provides for the making of regulations relating to the terms under which candidates may appeal the results of examinations and the procedures for such appeals.  I am of the view that regulations which will follow the primary legislation provide a much more flexible approach to many of the matters raised by the Deputy than prescription in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister of State's reaction to the amendment.  Many of the provisions in the Bill set out what was often thought but not well expressed.  We are putting into statutory form matters of which everybody is aware.  People know that the role of the Minister for Education and Science is to provide education appropriate to people's needs.  However, this was not being delivered.  Making a statutory provision draws a line in the sand which the Minister must meet.  A Minister would fail in his or her duty if that line were not met and people would have recourse to the courts and elsewhere if they found that the Minister did not do what the Oireachtas said he or she should do.</P>
      <P>This is also true of legislation.  The Minister of State pointed to the fact that regulations may provide for certain aspects.  However, that is not the same.  The point of the Bill is to move away from a position where people's rights and expectations are set out in letters and circulars internally in the Department and to give them a statutory basis.  I do not understand why we do not seek to set out some positive statements about people's rights in relation to the examination system as the amendment seeks.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said it is unnecessary and difficult to provide for in legislation.  It is difficult to provide for and nobody would attempt to set out in great detail what constitutes a fair test of a student's competence.  However, if Ministers or Departments failed to do that, it would be the legal reference point.  The question on which a judge would be expected to adjudicate is whether it was a fair test of a student's competence in the subject matter being tested.  This will open up issues for consideration in the future.</P>
      <P>It may be found in time that we have been much too narrow in the way in which competence in certain areas is tested.  Test issues will arise in relation to the examination system.  This is why it is important to have a legislative framework which forces Ministers to comply with certain standards and principles.  This is the point of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> No principles are set out in the section on examinations in terms of students' rights.  What must the Department deliver in relation to an examination system?  This should be covered in the Bill.  I made this point on Committee Stage and I am surprised that a measure was not developed in the intervening months.  The provision only states that the Minister may make regulations and that the Department will come down like a ton of bricks on people who commit offences.  That is only a partial view of what the examination system involves.  The stool is missing a leg.</P>
    <P>The amendment is my attempt to set out what I consider to be the principles underpinning a proper examination system which should be set out in statute.  I would be happy if the Minister considered that some polishing and improvement was required but the amendment would be accepted.  Regarding Deputy O'Shea's point, it may be stating the obvious but many of the provisions in the Bill state the obvious.  Unfortunately, the obvious is not always delivered in practice.  There would be some assurance of it being delivered if it was included in the legislative code.  I hope the Minister will think again about this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to the detail of how examinations are conducted.  This matter is more appropriate to detailed regulations which the Minister will make rather than provisions in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>I have experience of the courts and how principles such as these are dealt with by the courts.  On the basis of my experience, it would be worthless to include prescriptions of the type advanced in the amendment, undoubtedly with the best intentions.</P>
      <P>I propose between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad to discuss the matter with officials in the Department and to consider whether the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 51 should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In relation to paragraph (b) which deals with procedures where examinations are conducted and paragraph (d) which deals with the issuing of results of examinations, I am sure it will be possible to include a provision to make it abundantly clear that the examinations and the students referred to in the measure include students with special needs.  I will make that suggestion in all humility to the relevant officials and it will go some way towards meeting the Deputy's general point.  The detail of how examinations are to be conducted is a matter for regulations which may turn out to be longer than the legislation.  Short prescriptive terms would be legally valueless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fairness should be the touchstone of the sections which deal with examinations, <Col N="873" /> yet it has failed to receive a mention.  This is bizarre.  The Minister of State may be correct that the litigation route to achieve rights is a difficult one to travel but to fail to provide for the principle of fairness in legislation governing the functions of the Minister and the Department is even worse.  I accept his goodwill and welcome his commitment to look at section 51 again.  In addition to special needs, the section should include a reference to the object of examinations, namely, that they be a fair test of competence.  I still find it strange that the Department did not have something positive to say about them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 196:</P>
      <P>In page 35, line 34, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 51(1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make regulations as he or she from time to time considers appropriate for the effective conduct of examinations and in particular, without prejudice to the generality of the aforesaid, may make regulations relating to. the penalties to be imposed on a person who acts in breach of regulations made by the Minister or who otherwise misconducts himself or herself in respect of an examination.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; where it first appears.  It can be advanced that ignorance is not a defence but it is strange that we are seeking to impose penalties on a person who unknowingly acts in breach of regulations made by the Minister or who otherwise misconducts himself or herself in respect of an examination.  While the legislation should defend the integrity of the examination system, the terminology used in terms of the penalties to be imposed is draconian.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Shea is valid and he is right to raise it now rather than depend on the Minister to make provision in regulations to protect those who act reasonably but in breach of regulations.  I suspect that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, would tell us that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; does not have a great record.  It could never be proved in relation to the drink laws that a person had knowingly served drink to a minor.  One could say that they must have been crazy not to think that a baby was under the age of 18 but one could not prove that they knew.  This was a loophole in the law.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; may not be the best choice but the point is valid.  If a person takes reasonable steps to act within the regulations, they should be protected.  Provision should be made either in the Bill or regulations for a test of reasonableness before a person is exposed to penalties.</P>

The Bill provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she knowingly and maliciously obstructs any candidate or persons engaged in the conduct of an examination or otherwise interferes with the conduct of an examination. That is an extraordinarily wide provision as the phrase &ldquo;otherwise interferes with the conduct of an examination&rdquo; is open to loose interpretation. A student who unwittingly looks over his shoulder at another student's paper or brings material into an examination could be found guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister did not intend to create such a wide offence and I suggested that instead of using the words &ldquo;otherwise interferes with&rdquo; he should substitute the words &ldquo;or engages in activities that are likely to result in obstructing the conduct of an examination.&rdquo;  The Minister stated that &ldquo;otherwise interferes with the conduct of an examination&rdquo; referred to individuals who stole papers or disrupted an examination by creating a melee and it was not possible to complete the examination.  I am happy that these would be deemed offences but I have serious misgivings about this terminology remaining in the Bill.  We could make criminals of people who may have committed the equivalent of a yellow card offence.  They should be issued with <Col N="875" /> warnings, etc.  but to make them guilty of an offence leaves them open to summary conviction in subsequent sections.  Students would have criminal records, which would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I fully support the notion that the integrity of the examination system must be protected and people must police it.  Certain administrative penalties could be used for cogging, etc.  but criminal offences of the nature described in subsequent sections should not be included here.  I advocate my amendment as it uses preferable phraseology and it follows the Minister's original intention as discussed on Committee Stage.  I hope this is acceptable to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> In page 37, to delete lines 5 to 12 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Refusal of access to certain information.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;53.  &mdash; Notwithstanding any other enactment the Minister may &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) refuse access to any information which would enable the compilation of information (that is not otherwise available to the general public) in relation to the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of students enrolled therein, including without prejudice to the generality of foregoing &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the overall results in any year of students in a particular school in an examination, or</P>
    <P>(ii) the comparative overall results in any year of students in different schools in an examination, and</P>
    <P>(b) refuse access to information relating to the identity of examiners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a dual purpose to my amendment &mdash; first, to protect the identity of examiners and, second, to prevent the compilation of comparative information which could lead to the formation of school league tables.  The Bill already provides for the withholding of information in regard to examination performance only.  The amendment allows the withholding of information in relation to issues such as whole school evaluation and retention rates.  The release of such information would represent another form of league tables to which I am strongly opposed.</P>
    <P>The broad education community is in agreement on this issue.  League tables are crude comparisons of how schools perform in terms of the achievements of their students.  I will not accept amendment No. 201 because it is not appropriate to this section.  The rights of parents, students and staff in terms of their relationship with the school are not affected by this provision which relates solely to the Minister refusing access to national based information.  Schools will be free to continue to provide any information they wish and, indeed, as a result of a number of provisions in this Bill they have a statutory duty to do so. Sections 6(f) and (k), 9(g), 23(ii)(d) and (e) place statutory obligations on schools in terms of the provision of information to parents and the general school community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly support the Minister's position but I am convinced that it is necessary to state that nothing in this section will restrict the right of parents, students and staff to information about the results of their schools.  The phrase &ldquo;that is not otherwise available to the general public&rdquo; is used in an earlier section.  It is not clearly stated what a parent is entitled to from schools.  Schools are obliged to provide certain information to parents, but not any specific information. <Col N="877" /> This is a stricture which does not allow for the availability of certain information about examination results to third parties.  It could easily result in a practice developing within schools that such information is not open to discussion and that would be unhealthy.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that league tables would be undesirable because one is trying to measure everything in one line and everyone is aware that our education system is excessively rigid and one dimensional.  This would aggravate a weakness that is already there.  I support the Minister's principle not to have league tables, but equally I support the view that parents should have access to the fullest information.  I am unhappy that the combination of schools deciding what information they will release and this stricture coming into operation generally in terms of examination results might result in a hands off area where parents will not have reasonable access.</P>
      <P>That is why there is merit in stating explicitly what the Minister is saying implicitly, namely, that not only are parents' rights not affected, but they would have a reasonable right of expectation concerning such information.</P>

      <P>The <i>Sunday Times</i> is the only newspaper which has attempted to compile lists and say that one school is better than the other. However, we should not deny parents information. Everyone is interested in this information and parents are interested in their children's school.  This is relevant to the questions they will ask the school about how it is doing.  The combination of all of this will be to say that general exam results for a school are out of bounds, not only to the media, but to parents of children in the school.  That would be a bad development.</P>

      <P>What about a community which has three schools?  The profile of Irish second level education is different from that in England. We already have diversity which includes a degree of competition about which people inform themselves locally.  The danger is that one could end up with educational apartheid, even in a local context, whereby people would say that one school got so many Es or Fs.  What of a situation in which 50 students in one school are doing the leaving certificate and four or five do particularly badly?  Unrestricted access for parents would mean that it would not be hard to find out which students did badly.  Bit by bit one would be opening the door to comparative league tables.</P>
      <P>Some schools perform miracles and do well without ever achieving As and Bs.  Some teachers do very good work given the literacy and numeracy standards of the children.  This work will never be reflected in As or Bs.  I would hate to think that provisions in the Bill could lead to a situation in which that progress would never get due recognition but would be swamped by the generality of results.  Unfortunately, that is how people would use the information.  This would undermine the <i>raison d'etre</i> of amendment No. 200 which is to prevent the compilation of comparative league tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different view of this matter.  We have had this debate during Question Time and the Minister and I have different perceptions. The examination system is too narrow and we should not measure performance in such <Col N="879" /> a meaningless way.  There are many other aspects we should be measuring, celebrating, certifying and recognising in schools.  I strongly disagree with the assertion that, because we have a very narrow method of measuring success, we should close off information to parents.  The opposite should be the case.  We should be reforming the manner in which we certify, accredit and celebrate schools.  We should give parents access to that information and let them participate in the development of these aspects of their schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister's position is similar to that of the Kerryman who is asked directions and says that one does not start from here.  The Minister is starting from a position.  However, it would be a retrograde step if we denied parents access to information about how the school is doing in any area of activity.  The examination system is a very limited measure of performance.  Nonetheless, parents are interested in it and we cannot cut them off from that information.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the number of As is not the way to judge the success of a teacher or a school.  The test of the quality of teaching is the progress which children make and the experiences to which they are exposed.  I am nervous of the insidious element of this, which is that because we do not want league tables we are going to deny access to information which is legitimately the property of parents.  That is where we are heading.  The Minister recognises this fact by saying he is nervous that if parents have access to information about students in a school, they will talk to other parents and an overall picture will emerge of how different schools in an area are doing.  However, that is the price we have to pay for freedom of information and parents participating in the life of schools.</P>
      <P>I agree that we should prevent measures which would systematically lead to the compilation of league tables.  However, I do not agree with unwittingly closing off access to information which is the right of parents.  I am not trying to stop the Minister's intentions in this respect. However, nothing in this section, which I accept, would restrict the right of parents and students to obtain information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a fundamental and important area of the Bill.  It does occur that children who sit an examination in one year are better or worse than those who sit the examination in other years.  There are variations and simplistic information could be divulged when, for instance, a group of lower level achievers sit an examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between a D and a B on a pass paper could be a phenomenal achievement but might not look so impressive if compared with results from other schools.  I have strong feelings about the PR operations some schools mount in terms of their pupils' achievements.  If a lot of information were provided to parents, it might even <Col N="880" /> be possible to identify the results of individual pupils.  Any information provided could never be sufficiently comprehensive in terms of providing an overall context, nor could it describe the actual achievement of a particular pupil within a group in a particular year.</P>
    <P>I am strongly in favour of freedom of information but in the current milieu, where schools compete for pupils, there are inherent dangers in providing that kind of information.  As a former teacher and someone who observed the system over many years, I have grave reservations about any information other than information relating to a particular pupil being released to parents. Anything other than that could, in certain instances, be used in a way which could disadvantage a particular school.  On this occasion, I find myself in agreement with the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea has outlined the reasoning behind the amendment very eloquently. I acknowledge Deputy Bruton's genuine concern to strike a balance between parents' rights to information and the fundamental objectives of our education system.</P>
      <P>In recent years, we are thankfully moving away from the position where a terminal examination is seen as the single determining factor in assessing and evaluating student performance.  If we allow a situation to develop where league tables can be compiled, we will inevitably regress to a model where the only thing that will matter will be traditional leaving certificate results.  In view of the success of the leaving certificate applied and the LCVP, the way is open for more flexible modes of assessment and evaluation at second level.  I envisage the emergence of a more complex model in which we would have different modes of assessment in different subjects as the syllabi are revised by the NCCA.  In the event of the compilation of league tables, that complexity would be reduced to a very crude and simplistic analysis of performance.</P>
      <P>A great deal of concern was articulated about the transition year programme when it was first introduced.  It would be very difficult to provide information about the performance of students in transition year.  Individual schools have developed the programme in different ways and placed different emphases on it.  Many people regard the introduction of transition year as a great success story.  The leaving certificate applied programme has also grown significantly.  Taken together, it and the transition year will, over time, impact on the content of the leaving certificate programme and on the modes of assessment and evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unavailability of league tables is a very positive feature of Irish education and we should not do anything to encourage their compilation. The Bill provides very specific guarantees to parents in terms of access to their own individual records, school policy, objectives, curriculum and so on.  I do not believe there is any significant <Col N="881" /> restriction of parents' rights to information in this section.  School management boards will be free to provide information to parents with the proviso that they do not provide information which could enable the compilation of league tables. That is the purpose of amendment No. 200.  I do not believe there will be a problem on the ground in this regard.  Parents are generally well informed in terms of the programmes in which they wish their children to participate.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify that the Minister is not, through this amendment, seeking to adopt the power to direct boards not to issue information.  I would not for a moment stand over a situation where the Minister would prevent schools providing information because he feared it might be leaked.</P>
      <P>Irish history has taught us that if one makes something difficult to obtain, people will assume it is extraordinarily important and will turn handstands to obtain it.  The Minister will create a thriving black market in information on school performances.  There is a penal law mentality in this country that if one does not have something, one must obtain it.  We should be much more open and state that although the whole picture is not available, parents have a right to information, including information in respect of their schools. The Minister and I take a different view on this matter and I do not intend to delay the House any further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving on here to the bodies corporate. Essentially this relates to a power the Minister is taking to establish executive agencies to carry out certain functions.  The Minister intends to confer quite a lot of powers on such agencies.  I understand one such body corporate which we might see developed over time would deal with psychological services.  I am sure the Minister has others <Col N="882" /> in mind.  Amendment No. 202 provides that such an order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval and shall not take effect until after that approval has been granted.  In other words, the Minister would be obliged to come into the Dáil to inform it that he was proposing to establish an agency such as a national psychological services agency and to outline its functions, composition, method of staffing and budgetary operations.  The House would have to approve the order before it could take effect. Prior to making such an order, the Minister should consult with those directly affected by it, including staff who might be transferred, their unions or representative organisations, proposed recipients of the service and national associations representative of the education partners.  Prior to establishing a body or agency of this nature, we should engage in proper consultation and debate on it.  To provide a blank cheque to establish these bodies without having such provisions built in would not be a satisfactory way to proceed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(e) the continuing accountability of the Minister to the Oireachtas in respect of the activities of the body.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The end is in sight.  I hope we can indulge the Minister's good will on one final occasion.  Many <Col N="884" /> Deputies find it very frustrating that with the establishment of executive agencies the reply to legitimate parliamentary questions concerning the work of the agency, its impact and its success states that the Minister has no responsibility for the day to day activity of such a body.  I find this totally frustrating and undemocratic as it means the only accountability of such a body is if they are occasionally called before a House of the Oireachtas to account for their public accounts or before the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, something which has not happened to date.</P>
    <P>We should get some indication from the Minister that when he establishes executive agencies to do certain things which were previously his responsibility, we will not get this type of reply to legitimate parliamentary questions.  The amendment seeks to provide for the continuing accountability of the Minister to the Oireachtas in respect of the activities of the body.  Under the new dispensations the Minister is responsible for policy matters and the Secretary General is responsible for other matters.  Perhaps, therefore, the wording of my amendment is not entirely accurate in that there should be some reference to the Secretary General in the light of the division of responsibility. However, the traditional accountability to the Oireachtas should be maintained so we can get reasonable information about policy, activity levels, population targets, etc.  I hope the Minister agrees to the amendment as Members on both sides of the House spend time in limbo and it is in our mutual interest that we have reasonable access to information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly.  It can be very frustrating when new bodies are established and the Oireachtas tends to become marginal in terms of public policy and its implementation.  I am advised that section 54(6) provides for accountability to the Minister who continues to be accountable to the Oireachtas for any body or agency for which the Oireachtas provides funds as set out in section 58.  Therefore, to a certain extent sections 54(6) and 58 cover the point raised by the Deputy.  It is desirable that the legislation makes it clear that the Minister continues to remain accountable to the Oireachtas for the conduct of bodies and, to be doubly sure, I will accept Deputy Bruton's amendment subject to drafting.</P>

This is an extremely important Bill and the first Education Bill the Dáil has passed.  I am particularly conscious of this and it is important that we provided sufficient time to discuss it.  I acknowledge the extraordinary hard work Deputies put into the debate in terms of amendments, without the resources which are available to Ministers.  I think the Bill has been significantly improved since publication.  We acknowledge there are differences of opinion on a number of substantive issues, but this is the nature of parliamentary democracy.  I have no doubt there will be further amendments proposed and refinements required in the Seanad.  I thank my officials for their contribution.  The Bill is the culmination of a long period of consultation, etc.  and I thank them for their tremendous effort.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Mental Handicap Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Theresa Ahearn on Tuesday, 10 November 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the fact that people with mental handicap continue to live at the outer margins of society, and that their families frequently suffer great stress and hardship as a result of the denial of basic rights; aware, from Government-commissioned reports, that more than 1,000 people with a mental handicap live in completely inappropriate surroundings, and that thousands more are on waiting lists for essential services; believing there is a continuing <Col N="886" /> and growing crisis in the legitimate demands of people with a mental handicap for residential services, respite care, training, education and employment; conscious that the Government and Dáil Éireann have welcomed the publication of a number of critical reports in this area, notably the Strategy for Equality, which contains 402 recommendations about the rights of people with disabilities, and Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; An Assessment of Needs, which establishes a scientific database illustrating the gravity of the problem facing thousands of families; aware that the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 both accord significant priority to the needs and rights of people with a disability; believing that the current strong state of the Exchequer finances provides a unique and unanswerable opportunity to make significant inroads into the unacceptable waiting lists; calls on the Government to mount a front-loaded assault on the problems in the context of this year's budget, and, in particular, to allocate a minimum of £30 million in capital funding to enable the residential and respite care crisis to be addressed, with a further amount of at least £30 million in revenue funding for new services and places in education, training and sheltered and supported employment.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to persons with a mental handicap and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments which include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of additional funding of £25 million;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a £30 million National Capital Programme, over four years, to put in place appropriate infrastructure to support the services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to share my time with Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way we treat the weakest among us is a measure of the civilisation of our society.  Our treatment of mentally handicapped children and adults, in a time of plenty, is a damning indictment of our form of civilisation and a contradiction of our claim to be a Christian society.  I have no doubt the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has Christian concern for the <Col N="887" /> continuing under-resourcing of services for the mentally handicapped but Christian charity is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As a socialist, I declare the right of the mentally handicapped to the best services we can provide in residential places, day care services, special educational services, safe and adequate travel and in-home services to ensure they enjoy the highest standards achievable and that their dignity as citizens is ensured.</P>
    <P>This matter was examined in detail by the previous Government and greatly increased funding was provided to meet the detailed and recognised needs of the mentally handicapped.  That was a beginning and not an end to tackling the problem, but this Government has frozen that progressive approach.</P>
    <P>We call on the Government tonight, particularly the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the holder of the purse, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy &mdash; whose purse is overflowing with taxpayers' money &mdash; to provide the necessary funds for a decent level of services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, came to my constituency before the last election and in the St. John of God school in Celbridge he made specific promises to the well-organised media audience. He promised that the area of mental illness and learning disability would no longer be the Cinderella of the health service, even if this meant reductions in other areas of expenditure.  He stated: &ldquo;If I am Minister for Health any work I do will be in the area of mental handicap and learning disability&rdquo;.  The Minister failed to deliver on his promises to the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>On 30 October, parents in that St. John of God school were informed that respite services were discontinued.  I want to read a letter to the Minister written by one of the parents concerned.  It states:</P>
    <P>My son James is 32 years old.  He is profoundly handicapped i.e. doubly incontinent, has to be fed, washed, lifted and requires 24 hour care.  James is wheelchair bound and recently diagnosed with cancer of his stomach. He is also an epileptic since birth.</P>
    <P>James has had brief respite care over recent years as both of us parents have serious heart problems.  I, his father have serious heart trouble and currently have to see my doctor regularly.  His mother has had serious heart surgery and is also under strict doctors instructions not to overdo her workload &mdash; some chance of that in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have looked after James ourselves for 32 years and saved the State a fortune.  On receiving this letter from Br.  Gregory last week we just sat down and cried all day &mdash; we asked ourselves &mdash; just what is happening in the Dept. of Health that will allow this nightmare for us.</P>
    <P>Now we have no break at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> That is not the whole story from St. Raphael's. There are 30 children in day care who should be in full residential care.  Ten of those are in the acute category and there is a waiting list for both day and residential services.</P>
    <P>Apart from St. Raphael's in Celbridge, the other organisation providing services for the mentally handicapped in County Kildare is CARE. This voluntary organisation is grossly underfunded and needs an additional £270,000 for day to day expenditure in 1998 to prevent it going into liquidation.  If this pittance is not provided by the Minister now, CARE will be legally obliged to close down and discontinue day services to 380 people and residential services to 18 others.  This deficit arose because the Minister did not provide any funding this year for 40 people in day services in Kildare.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a political football of the mentally handicapped before the election.  If he fails to deliver to them now, he will be long remembered for that failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase for the Department of Health and Children in the Estimates published today and hope the Minister will be in a position to tell us that an adequate amount of money has been provided to implement in full the terms of this motion concerning services for people with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>If we were to ask the public in a referendum if they wanted the basic needs of people with a mental or physical handicap provided for, I have no doubt it would be passed with 100 per cent support, yet funding for that most vulnerable sector of our society continues to be insufficient. How can we value ourselves as a caring and inclusive society when at least 1,300 mentally handicapped people are waiting for a residential place and another 1,000 are living in totally unsuitable conditions for their needs?</P>
      <P>This is a basic human rights issue which must be addressed as such.  People with a mental or physical handicap should have suitable services as of right.  We must make this fundamental shift in attitude and now is the time to do that.  We have the research and data, we know the level and cost of need in our community and now, more than at any other time, we have the money.  We need this shift to a rights-based approach.  The documents Services to People with a Mental Handicap &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001, the Strategy for Equality and Towards an Independent Future identified the needs in this area and there is no reason not to fund them.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister indicated that funding must be provided for the emergency cases that arise.  Funding capital and revenue must be provided to meet the full extent of that need and ongoing data must be collated so that the calculation of need accurately reflects those requiring an appropriate service.  Waiting lists must be eliminated and nothing less is good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> There would not be any question of telling a person they cannot get their pension because there is not sufficient money in the social welfare budget, or telling a five year old child he or she cannot go to school because there is not enough money in the education budget.  However, that is what we are doing to people with a mental handicap. We need public policy that is based on right. It exists in other areas and it should apply in relation to disability.</P>
    <P>We need particular provision for respite care. We should also consider people with mild mental handicap, many of whom are not even included in the data that have been assessed.  We must also provide for the elderly mentally handicapped in our society whose numbers are growing.  This is a rights-based issue and now is the time to fund it appropriately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand I am sharing my time with Deputies Callely, Wright, Batt O'Keeffe, Hanafin and Conor Lenihan.</P>
      <P>We cannot provide sufficiently for this group of people.  I share the philosophy that, at a time when the wealth of the nation is so augmented, we must do everything in our power to provide for this group.  We may have had excuses in the past because of the transitional nature of our economic development, but at this stage in our progress as a nation there is no excuse for us not providing all we can provide for those who are impaired by a mental handicap.  I know from my discussions with the Minister that he has put this issue at the top of his priorities.</P>
      <P>He has done so notwithstanding the fact that there are many lobby groups in the health and medical fields which are far more vocal, which receive far more money from the Exchequer and which wield much more political muscle than this group.  I congratulate those who have made an effort to set about organising this interest and securing all the assistance they can from the public purse.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear Deputy Stagg introduce party politics.  The Government of which he was part did have one major achievement in the major exercise of the assessment of need.  That document, Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap/Intellectual Disability &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997 &mdash; 2001, was an important intellectual exercise in assessing the extent of the problem.  It drew something to our attention that we instinctively knew from our constituencies &mdash; that the problem was far more extensive than the official statistics indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That publication was an intellectual exercise. What lies before this Minister is a very practical exercise, which is to facilitate funding and expenditure that will ensure that the requirements set out in the assessment are met.  That lies before the Minister, and I know the Government has made a definite commitment to implement these additional services set out in that document.  The total funding allocated by the Minister this year is £25 million for services to persons with a mental <Col N="890" /> handicap.  That figure is far in excess of the £12 million provided by the previous Administration. I do not make that point out of political partisanship. I know that that Government was completing this major intellectual exercise with the assessment of needs document.  When I raised this matter while in Opposition, the assessment of needs document was produced as the reason urgent action was not being taken.  I congratulate the Minister on the extent to which he has moved on this issue.  I urge him to continue on that road and to find all the money he can for this group.</P>

I have a long track record of deep concern and commitment to addressing the serious difficulties that prevail in the provision of services to people with a mental handicap.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a parliamentary question to Deputy Howlin when he was Minister for Health asking the number of people with a mental handicap who were misplaced in psychiatric hospitals.  His answer was that persons with a mental handicap continued to be cared for in psychiatric hospitals either because they were not suitable for transfer or because transfer could not be arranged at the time.  He was not in a position to give details of developments which might be put in place, as the <Col N="891" /> then level of funding made available for such a development was budgeted.</P>

I do not want to make a political football out of this, but Deputy Stagg spoke tonight about what he would do if he were in a position to deliver.  He was in that position, but he failed, as did others who signed this motion.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that successive Governments have failed to deliver on this.  The credibility of all political parties and individuals is at stake.</P>

      <P>I have visited nearly every service provider and Eastern Health Board facility to get a handle on the provision of services to people with a mental handicap.  I have fought hard for the improvement and delivery of services in my constituency.  I was surprised to learn on visiting a service provider that it was not offering residential placement.  I am pleased that since pursuing the provider's needs it is able to offer residential placement.  The difficulties and backlog caused &mdash; not necessarily due to lack of Government commitment and funding &mdash; can be imagined.  There are a lot of issues to be acknowledged here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins has said, we should move forward with a positive, planned process.  An overriding priority must be to tip the balance in favour of the clearly acknowledged need for services. The document Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap/Intellectual Disability &mdash; An Assessment of Need 1997 &mdash; 2001 was initiated by the previous Administration for the period in question, and that programme was given an injection of £12 million in 1997.  When this Government came to office it adopted that document and accelerated the provision of services with £25 <Col N="892" /> million instead of £12 million.  However, let us not complicate matters by scoring political points.  We know the priorities &mdash; the provision of appropriate residential places, the provision of required day care places including education, training and a sheltered environment and improved, extended respite services.</P>
    <P>Let us send a clear message to all on our commitment to this issue.  I ask every party and Deputy to consider this matter individually.  Let us reach agreement in unity to move forward positively in the best interest of those with a mental handicap.  Let us not be divisive.  The money is available and the assessment is there.  It is a matter of agreeing to move forward positively.</P>

      <P>Within two months of the present Minister for Health and Children's appointment I was summoned to his office to discuss the situation in St. Ita's, Portrane.  He made it clear to me that he intended to ensure that something was done in relation to the situation there.  He made a private visit there in November and was able to see the appalling conditions at first hand.  Having covered every part of the complex, he stated that he intended to do something about the situation in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Following that private visit and having consulted with the Eastern Health Board and asked for an immediate plan in relation to a particular section, as well as an overall plan, the Minister announced, this week, a £13 million allocation for St. Ita's, Portrane.  He has been able to ensure that extra funding was allocated.  The Minister's response has at last given hope to the staff and parents associated with St. Ita's.  In his first 18 months in office, he has allocated substantial funding to St. Ita's which for many years was crying out for some Minister to respond to its needs. Some £200,000 has been provided by the Eastern Health Board and the Minister for a holiday home for the clients, parents and friends of St. Ita's.  The response to the announcement from the hospital staff and all associated with it has been extremely positive.  It is part and parcel of an overall plan which the Minister has taken on board to improve the deplorable conditions he witnessed on the occasion of his visit.</P>
      <P>The announcement by the Minister for Education and Science last week of a £4 million initiative for special education services shows the Government has an overall coherent plan.  This is an area that may have been neglected in the past. There is no Deputy in the House who, either on a daily or weekly basis, does not have a constituent who is not in need of some of these services. In the space of a week the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science have responded.  The five year plan set out in the programme for Government has been adhered to and the funding needed for these projects has been delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency and in many other constituencies the great work being undertaken by many voluntary organisations which should be done by <Col N="893" /> other services is being responded to by the Minister. In my constituency of Dublin North fantastic work is being done by voluntary organisations in Fingal workshop and, for the past ten years, in the Arts Club in Portmarnock.  I hope in the not too distant future the Minister will provide the necessary capital funding for these people to carry out their work.  That would be for the betterment of those being cared for.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate and to welcome the visitors in the gallery who are associated with those suffering from mental handicap.  They are welcome to participate in this debate.  They afford us the opportunity to indicate to them our sincerity in dealing with an extremely important service, the delivery of a comprehensive service to those with a mental disability.</P>
      <P>When the Government was formed it was evident there was an interest in and a focus on improving the overall service.  The Minister with special responsibility in this area has decided that during his term of office he will ensure a proper service is in place for that section of society that has been denied proper funding for many years.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in the lead up to this debate no consultant said that patients would die as a result of a poor service.  There was not a whimper from that section that anything would happen to those with a mental handicap because the service is inadequate.  These people did not knock down the door of the Minister for Health and Children asking him to provide additional funding for the service.  In terms of delivering psychiatric services every health board will be within its budget.  Generally this is because those who are in the service go about their job quietly and do it in a professional manner.  On top of that the parents, families and friends of those suffering from mental handicap are so involved and totally engrossed with the member of their family who suffers from mental handicap that they have not had the time to protest.  Therefore, it behoves us in the House and those of us on health boards to speak up for this category and to stop dancing to the consultant tune.</P>
      <P>I refer the House to the statement by the representative of the consultants when he exhorted chief executive officers in health boards to break the law.  The same individual did not ask his own consultants if they would break the law.  Maybe it would have been more appropriate for that representative to look inwardly rather than outwardly and to ask whether his members could save more money for the health board to ensure that at budget time we can make more money available for the delivery of this type of service. He could have asked whether it was possible for consultants to perform more operations on public patients <i>vis-á-vis</i> private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children may be gruff at times but behind the exterior he has a heart when it comes to the delivery of a proper and comprehensive service to those suffering <Col N="894" /> from mental handicap.  As chairman of the Committee on Health and Children I am aware from my discussions with him over a long period that he has taken it upon himself to ensure a lessening of the burden, particularly for parents who have to care for those suffering from mental handicap. There is an emphasis on providing a funding infrastructure for the delivery of a proper service in this area.  This is evident by the amount of money provided over an 18 month period.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the amount of money that has been provided is not adequate to deliver the full and comprehensive service.  However, I ask the people in the Visitors' Gallery to remember that this is a four year programme and that, as part of that programme, the Government and the Minister are committed to delivering the type of service they need and which those proposing this motion did not deliver, which is to their eternal shame.</P>

      <P>Over the past two nights in discussing persons with mental handicap we have been talking in terms of thousands looking for day services, for residential care and for respite care.  It is important to look behind the numbers at the people we are talking about.</P>
      <P>We are talking about Andrew who is autistic and whose only pleasure in life is the fast forward button on the video machine.  We are talking about Stephen who only likes noise.  We are talking about Mark who finds it difficult to communicate. We are talking about young children and adults whose very happy laugh I am quite sure belies the frustration and pain felt by their parents. These parents love their children to the end and are proud of those children's bravery, achievements, sense of optimism and zest for life.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to love these children as children, but when is an adult not an adult?  It is when he has the mind of a child and needs to be cared for, toileted and bathed like a child.  These are the matters which cause stress and hardship for the parents and families of young adults with mental handicap.  These families find it difficult to lead a life outside that child.  For example, they cannot find babysitters &mdash; how does one ask a 15 year old to babysit an 18 year old?</P>
      <P>These people are dependent on the support of voluntary agencies and groups, such as parents' and friends' associations and the St. John of Gods.  A good friend of mine, Vincent, said that when his other children were born he was given an education for them but when young Vinnie was born he was given a collection box because he was forced to fund-raise over the years for his child.  In this regard, I welcome the initiative of £4 million introduced in the past week by the Minister, Deputy Martin, to help children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about giving thousands of people millions of pounds but hundreds of Members of this House have failed to live up to the problem in recent years.  A very similar motion to this one was discussed in the House 21 <Col N="895" /> years ago.  We have all seen at a local and personal level the service offered to people who need such services, none more special than the Carmona services of St. John of God in my constituency of Dun Laoghaire, where there is a long waiting list for the tremendous service offered. They have made a budget submission of £7 million, which I support.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet Deputies of all parties next week to discuss that submission.</P>
    <P>I was particularly taken yesterday by the comment of a young mother who said that if her child were a criminal, a cow or had a hurley in his left hand he would get more money from the State. I share the commitment of this Minister and his concern.  I know he is committed to the five year programme.  I know this debate has given us an opportunity to articulate those needs and I also know that when the term of this Government is over we will have met those needs.</P>

      <P>I join my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, in acknowledging the presence in the Visitors' Gallery tonight and last night of the parents, families and representatives of those with mental handicap.  They face a difficult situation and it is terrible they have had to make their protest in this manner.  As Deputy Hanafin said, it is symptomatic of a much deeper malaise which has occurred over a period of 21 years.</P>
      <P>However, I am glad I am part of a Government which will support an amendment to this motion which will put in place the building blocks for a better future for the people in the Visitors' Gallery and the children for whom they work every day.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has a combative and aggressive public image and style of debate.  However, as many of my colleagues will agree, he goes about his business as a Minister in a quiet and efficient manner, which is important in this difficult and emotional situation in which many parents in the Visitors' Gallery and elsewhere find themselves.</P>
      <P>I saw that difficult situation at first hand on the doorsteps of my constituency during my first election campaign last year.  I saw parents of children with mental disabilities who were in tears on the doorstep about the terrible situation they were facing into and the feeling of being trapped in their own homes without any assistance from the State.  I am lucky that none of my immediate family have had to face that terrible and difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has emphasised the need to put the cares and considerations of these people at the very forefront.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is a serious player in the Government but we also have the Minister of State, Deputy Mary <Col N="896" /> Wallace, who is the first Minister of State to be dedicated full-time to the cause which concerns the people in the Visitors' Gallery.  That is a signal of our commitment.  We gave that signal before the election and we maintained it afterwards with the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, which was deeply significant.  I am glad the people in the Visitors' Gallery and the organisations they represent are now formally represented by a Minister of State, and long may that continue.</P>
    <P>The Government's emphasis is on planned provision and the elimination of waiting lists.  There are 900 people waiting for residential places and 300 for day care.  It is a serious challenge and we do not know if the waiting lists will expand later. We are facing a difficult situation but we are facing it in a planned and proper manner, a manner which will involve planning for the future and meeting the requirements we saw in the assessment of need, which stretches from 1997 to 2001. It sets the path by which we will go forth, plan and spend the money.</P>
    <P>Over the four year period of that plan there is a sum of £65.3 million on the revenue side to fund the day to day essential services and £39 million on the capital side.  I emphasise that the last Government, some members of which are proposing this motion, spent £12 million last year, while we spent £28 million this year.  The last Government conveniently omitted to indicate before it broke up, how much it would spend on the capital side.  If one looks at the overall picture, during the life time of this Government we will spend £65.3 million on the services side and an extra £39 million on the capital side.  After 2001, we will have spent well over £1 billion on this area.  We are not saying the worst is over, but we are saying a start has been made and for that the Government, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, should be congratulated.</P>

      <P>I recently met with CROSS-CARE, an organisation which supports many families in need of respite care and residential care.  I have some idea of the huge frustration felt by people caring for those with mental handicap. I have worked with ARCH in Portmarnock and I have an idea of the needs of families with young children in that position.  However, none of that can prepare one for the experience which those families must face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I will use the example of St. Ita's Hospital in my constituency as an indicator of how the mentally handicapped are treated in 1998.  St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane was opened in 1896 as an auxiliary hospital to <Col N="897" /> ease pressure on places in the then Richmond Asylum.  It was built to cater for more than 2,000 patients.  In 1993 the Eastern Health Board produced a document entitled &ldquo;St. Ita's Past, Present and Future&rdquo; of which the main element was a recommendation to close the hospital and resettle people in more appropriate environments.  In 1997 the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities specifically highlighted conditions in St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In the wider community currently more than 1,400 people &mdash; and the figure is rising &mdash; have learning difficulties and mental handicap and are in critical need of residential care.  The funding allocation for services for people with learning disabilities and mental handicap is proportionately lower than for other services.  Psychiatric services have 10 per cent of the funding allocation, general hospital services, 51 per cent, but the handicapped, covering all areas of handicap including the blind and the deaf, have only 9 per cent.  Patients in St. Ita's Hospital have lived in condemned wards and units in the past and continue to do so.  This was cited in a case brought to Europe as an instance of an abuse of fundamental human rights.  The recently published database on the assessment of needs 1997 to 2001 reported that an investment of £65 million at that time, or £70 million today, was needed to meet the current identified needs of people with learning disabilities or mental handicap.  The £13 million planned for St. Ita's Hospital is inadequate, given the number of patients for whom the hospital is currently providing.</P>
    <P>St. Ita's Hospital will be the test case as to whether the Government can provide for the needs of people with learning difficulties or mental handicap at a national level.  Cuts in the late 1980s and early 1990s made it extremely difficult for health boards to implement the planning for the future policy.  What is at issue is not the need to fundamentally change the policy set out in planning for the future, but the need to implement those policies that have been articulated. That is all this motion is seeking to do.  The Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, fully supports it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support this motion.  It addresses a huge section of the population, those with a mental handicap and those whose lives are dedicated to the care of the handicapped.  The full extent of this section of our population in terms of numbers is not fully known, but it is so extensive that there are very few people who do not have some direct or indirect knowledge of the problem from family experience.  My brother, Dermot, has Down's Syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations sought in this motion are in tens of millions of pounds, but those caring for the mentally handicapped have saved and continue to save this State hundreds of millions of pounds by the constant care which they give at great cost to themselves.  Those with a mental <Col N="898" /> handicap have a right to care whether provided by caring relatives or by the State.  In the case of the vast majority who are cared for by their relatives, it must be recognised that their special needs have not been met and commitments repeatedly given have yet to be fulfilled.  Successive Governments have undertaken to provide mental handicap services for those without services at present and for those people with a mental handicap who are currently resident in psychiatric hospitals.  It is a national scandal that the latter category still exists.</P>
    <P>The provision of services overall remain inadequate and piecemeal and fail to address the plight of those ageing parents or siblings of the mentally handicapped who bear the burden of care.  Older parents and ageing brothers and sisters are trying to cope in very limited home conditions, many of them on their own.  They face physical and mental hardship.  Their social lives are severely curtailed or non-existent because of the demands of round the clock care.  In many cases their domestic finances are strained to breaking point.  On top of the physical burden of catering for all the needs of their mentally handicapped relatives, they have the constant worry and question that grows more urgent as they grow older, &ldquo;what will become of him or her when I am gone&rdquo;.  This worry looms larger for carers than the daily strain of care which takes such a physical toll on older people.</P>
    <P>The measures called for in this motion would address that worry and provide the services so badly needed and long overdue.  I urge the Government to listen to the voice of the most vulnerable and implement these measures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> On behalf of myself and the Socialist Party, I express our total support for this motion which seeks to give necessary and crucially needed resources to those who suffer from a mental handicap and to those who care for them.  No words of mine can express the suffering, the anguish and the exhaustion of those who, in many cases, are on their own or have very little back-up support in taking care of a person with a mental handicap.  Our society stands condemned when it allows the mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of those with a handicap to stand alone without providing the support that is necessary and forces them to take on the role of the great exploited in our society, the unpaid carers of those who cannot care for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major issue in this area, about which people regularly contact me, is the provision of respite care for people with disabilities.  It would be hard for us to know what a few weekends off and a holiday of a few weeks would mean to a parent, brother sister or carer of a person with a mental handicap.  All we are being asked to do is to provide the resources that would make that possible. If we cannot find a few tens of millions of pounds to take care of those who desperately need it and channel it away from the greedy minority in an era when the Celtic tiger is running right riot and <Col N="899" /> the banks, financial institutions and industries are making profits hand over fist, we do not deserve to be a Parliament of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the statistics on this issue and they are truly shameful.  We also know the reality of the position because parent groups have lobbied TDs and Governments for years.  They left us with no doubt as to the depth of the crisis and their growing frustration and sense of hopelessness. The Minister for Health and Children is fully aware that the mentally handicapped on waiting lists are long overdue funds to provide for their basic essential requirements.  Tonight all of us have a unique opportunity to show that politics works and that we can unite and deliver on reasonable and legitimate demands.  I am happy to support this motion and hope that all Members will set aside party politics and other considerations and join together in acknowledging in a practical way the justifiable fears and concerns of a vulnerable section of our community.</P>
      <P>Families with mentally handicapped members are positive and patient people.  They are generous in their acceptance of the heavy burden thrust upon them.  All they seek is a level of support which will enable them to care for their handicapped children as long as possible and in an environment suited to the level of his or her handicap.  In the absence of proper support and a planned cradle to the grave service the burden on parents becomes intolerable.  How often have we heard parents say, they simply cannot die for fear of what will happen to their sons or daughters when they are gone, who will care for them and who will cater for their needs?  How often have we seen the immense pressure and strain result in ill health in one or both parents leading to an eventual family crisis when the inevitable happens?</P>
      <P>There are many examples where a brother or sister has to take on the responsibility of care on the death of their parents and the cycle of care continues into the next generation.  Against that background we can only imagine the isolation and confusion of mentally handicapped people as they try to understand what is evolving about them.  In this modern and sophisticated age it is an affront to the dignity of the mentally handicapped that they are not guaranteed a sustained quality level of service.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the mothers, fathers and carers of the mentally handicapped who are here.  Coming from the mid-west I pay special tribute to Ger South from Limerick who has done excellent work over many tireless years on behalf of the mentally handicapped.  The motion deals with one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.  It is a disgrace that people with a mental handicap are forced to live in the outer margins of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair that fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and carers are put in a situation where they <Col N="900" /> suffer extreme stress because their loved one, who is mentally retarded, is denied basic human rights.  It is unacceptable that at the height of the success of the Celtic tiger, 1,000 citizens with mental handicap live in completely inappropriate surroundings.</P>
    <P>A just and humane society would make it a priority to meet the legitimate demands of people with a mental handicap such as residential service, respite care, training, education and employment. The present crisis must be dealt with in a humane, comprehensive and consultative way. The strong state of the Exchequer finances provides a unique opportunity to make significant inroads into the unacceptable waiting lists.  The Minister has a moral and political duty to do so. I support the proposal in the motion that the Government allocate a minimum of £30 million in capital funding to enable the residential and respite care crisis to be addressed and that a further amount of at least £30 million be provided for new services in education, training, shelter and support employment.</P>
    <P>The mother of a 23 year old handicapped son, a traveller, presented me with a letter dated 19 October from the consultant psychiatrist in learning disability at Bawnmore Brothers of Charity. The letter says the child urgently requires residential placement within the mentally handicapped services but unfortunately Bawnmore cannot offer him a bed as there are no vacancies. The letter went on to inform the mother that the matter had been discussed that afternoon with the director of services, that they were acutely aware of the situation and suggested she write to the director of disability services at the Mid-Western Health Board in connection with this most serious problem.</P>
    <P>However, the health board does not have the finances to create further places.  In 1998, allocation for the development of services in the mid-west region for those requiring a mentally handicapped service was totally inadequate.  It did not meet the immediate and urgent needs of persons in the region with a mental handicap.  I ask the Minister to immediately increase the allocation of funds available for residential services in 1999. There is an immediate and urgent requirement for the provision of 31 residential places in the mid-west region.</P>

      <P>I received telephone calls last weekend from many people in County Mayo who would have loved to attend this debate but could not do so because they had to stay at home to look after their children as they get very little care from the health board.  People in the county must travel long distances for services.  For example, those in Belmullet have to travel 75 miles to Castlebar or Ballina and almost 90 miles to Galway.  It is terrible that they must suffer in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major collections for autism take place in the county to send two children to Boston to be educated.  That is scandalous that in 1988 people <Col N="901" /> have to raise that money themselves.  While £20 million is spent on sporting organisations, we cannot look after people with a mental handicap.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>A woman telephoned me on Monday asking me for my support in the Dáil on this debate.  I assured her I would support the motion, but I told her there was no point in approaching me because it was a matter for the Government.  This issue is above politics.  We should support and assist people with disabilities.  We are told the Celtic tiger is awash with money, yet this woman asks me what will happen when she dies and there is nobody to look after her son?  That is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>We have very little services in the west.  Western Care collects money on a daily basis by knocking on doors and organising benefit dances. Yet, the State cannot provide support and assistance. Collections are necessary to send our handicapped children to Boston and other parts of America to be educated and assisted.  Approximately £1 million is won on the national lottery every Saturday.  Would £300,000 not be enough in winnings with the balance going to people who need to be looked after, especially the mentally handicapped?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  This matter has been before the House on other occasions, but no matter how often it arises those involved continue to look after their loved ones in their homes.  It is more difficult for older people to look after mentally handicapped children.</P>
      <P>Originally friends of the mentally handicapped raised funds on a voluntary basis.  In this regard, I pay tribute to all the work done by St. Christopher's in County Longford.  There are now two residential homes in the county, one in Longford, the other in Abbeylara.  I also thank the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who helped us on that occasion.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are told people are travelling from other parts of the world to learn about the Celtic tiger let the visitors attending this debate and people like them enjoy some of the benefits of this booming economy.  If we do not look after our handicapped people it is a bad reflection on the caring Irish.  We are known across the world for the way we care for people. Let us care for our own first.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister, being from a midland constituency, will support the proposal for St. Christopher's in Longford and the other demands across the country.  It can be done if the will is there.  The money is available, it is there to be given away.  Any sporting organisation in need of money can get it from the Minister for Finance. The Minster should get the money from him for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for enabling me to share time.  Few Ministers have had the opportunity afforded to the Minster on this occasion to respond positively to the needs of people with a mental handicap.  Over the years <Col N="902" /> services to the mentally handicapped have been <i>ad hoc.</i>  They have been provided in reaction to crises rather than being focused on long-term policies to provide facilities for those in need.</P>
      <P>People with a mental handicap should be given the opportunity to live as full a life as possible in their own environments with their families and friends.  We do not fully understand or acknowledge the contribution of parents and family towards care, attention and provision of education for a member of their family with a mental handicap.  It has been described as a 24 hour job, 365 days a year without pay.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children and health boards have rarely been proactive in their efforts to help or assist in this matter. Rather, they put parents and families literally through the wringer before they will respond, often grudgingly, to their needs.  If the Department of Health and Children has an additional £120 million as a result of the Estimates today, surely the Minister can respond to the needs of the 3,000 members of our community who are handicapped.  They have been overlooked in the past.  There has been ongoing neglect and indifference to children in need.  I find it difficult to say why it is the Department of Health and Children alone that has to take responsibility for the handicapped.  These children are not sick.  They are handicapped.  The current Education (No. 2) Bill going through the Dáil does little to reassure me that the Department of Education and Science is prepared to shoulder its responsibilities in this area.  The language throughout many sections of this Bill clearly indicates reservations with the inclusion of terms like &ldquo;as far as resources permit&rdquo; or &ldquo;within the resources provided&rdquo;.  I plead with the Minister to co-ordinate between health and education so that one will not be played off against the other and give an excuse to do nothing as has happened all too often in the past.  It is difficult for parents to reconcile how the Minister for Education and Science can provide £250 million to teach computer skills in our schools and still deny the disabled access even to proper facilities within a school.</P>
      <P>Parents' groups in Ballinasloe, whom the Minister has met, known as the Ballinasloe Advocates for the Mentally Handicapped, are asking only for fair play for their children in need, equality for their children with disability.  They want appropriate and adequate service for their children. The Minister has the responsibility on this occasion.  When the Minister last met this group he told them the resources were all gone.  The health board had no further responsibility to provide care for the people in the Ballinasloe area. Was it fair that on many occasions parents had to see children spend six hours on a bus outside their catchment area in order to avail of even basic facilities?  I ask the Minister, now that he has the opportunity, to provide facilities for the people in Ballinasloe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time I have, I want to raise a number of important issues.  First, we have a situation within a number of our psychiatric hospitals where people with a mental handicap are being accommodated.  In one case of which I am aware there are approximately 50 people ranging in age from their early 20s to their mid 50s in a psychiatric hospital.  The majority of these people have a medium to severe mental handicap which, the health board agrees, makes them unsuitable for this type of institution. However, the board are penny-pinching to try to get the funds to provide suitable accommodation for these people.  They have continually requested funding from the Department of Health and Children, but their requests seem to be falling on deaf ears.  The days of putting people with a mental handicap into psychiatric institutions and forgetting about them must be consigned to history once and for all.  We cannot allow people with a mental handicap to be pushed to the margins of society, out of sight, out of mind.</P>
      <P>The biggest worry facing many parents with adult children with a mental handicap is the lack of residential care.  Speaking with elderly parents, one can see fear in their eyes when they raise the question of what is going to happen to their son or daughter when they pass away.  Residential care is a basic requirement.  Funds must be provided immediately to meet this growing demand.</P>
      <P>The lack of speech therapy for children with a disability is nothing short of a disgrace.  Recently I met a woman who had a son, John, with Down's Syndrome.  This child, after nine years of education, has not received one hour of speech therapy. This is because of the lack of funding for this service and the petty bickering between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.  There is no co-ordination between those Departments on services for the mentally handicapped.  How can we pontificate about integration when children are not given the opportunity even to communicate properly?  It is a disgraceful situation.  This child spent five years in a school that did not even have heating, a basic requirement that every other primary school has.  What was done here tonight by members of the Government in calling this a political issue is a disgrace.  Fathers, mothers and siblings of mentally handicapped children have spoken here tonight.  It is not a political issue.  Everyone is speaking from their hearts on issues that need to be addressed and which must be addressed.  I urge the Minister to support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my support to this motion. I congratulate and thank the people who made it to the Public Gallery tonight for their support down through the years on behalf of parents and siblings.  It is one of the most difficult situations any family can face to have a handicapped person to look after on a day to day basis.  My direct involvement is through a next door neighbour who has a child with cerebral palsy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I beg the Minister tonight to realise that services are needed for people like this outside Dublin. I do not suggest the Minister is the only person responsible.  His predecessors have failed to provide the necessary physiotherapists and other back-up services that handicapped people need in the more remote areas.  People spoke about millions of pounds, and it certainly is necessary. However, I want to concentrate on a few small things.</P>
    <P>Many families need a couple of weeks' respite care to allow them to take a holiday or to have a break.  They need the odd weekend off.  When a person caring for a young adult needing 24-hour care can get only five hours help a week from the health board, we must look seriously at our commitment to these families who are trying their best to keep their handicapped relatives at home. They get one hour's help per day, and no help at the weekend.  I ask the Minister to make sure that whatever funds health boards need are made available so that they can rectify that situation not just for the handicapped but also for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I could go through a list of people.  I have a letter here from somebody who had to go from the health boards to the Department of Education and Science for two and a half years looking for help and who eventually, at his cost, had to go to London.  Somebody else had to wait five years to get agreement between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children on the question of the education of his child.</P>
    <P>We have some great services.  Camphill Communities is a national group backed by outside bodies.  The problem is to provide funding for the very great job they are doing.  Will the Minister ensure that voluntary groups such as Camphill Communities will be facilitated in every way.</P>

I will speak about waiting lists, the fact that they are growing and that we are not coming to grips with them.  Year in and year out these lists are growing, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area where this year the list stands at 528, 80 more than last year.  Despite commitments by this and successive Governments to gradually eliminate the list, the list is growing, and for totally predictable and understandable reasons.  Because of the way they are structured, they do not take account of the fact that every year there are predictable emergencies, because children are born with multiple handicaps and life-threatening conditions for which they have to be immediately admitted, and when one child is admitted as an emergency somebody else goes to the bottom of the list.  The list is growing because parents die each year, because they have breakdowns, because they are no longer able to cope.  The result is that people have to be admitted in an emergency and then other people have to go to <Col N="905" /> the bottom of the list.  This year the Eastern Health Board is taking in people as an emergency measure and spending the following year's allocation, so that there is always a catch-up and the list is never eliminated.</P>
      <P>Other speakers spoke about the pain and misery experienced by parents.  They cannot even begin to understand that; even the families themselves cannot communicate it.  It is our job to address this problem.  I urge the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to do something about this scandal which is a shameful reflection on all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the visitors in the Gallery and I welcome this debate on the crucial issue of services for people with a mental handicap.  The Government has no problem in agreeing that these services must be improved.  We must ensure that services are appropriate and responsive to the needs of people who, for too long, have been low on the public policy agenda.  I have listened carefully to the debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>To date, this Government has a record of delivering funding for services to the mentally handicapped which is unmatched by any previous Government.  In the past year, the Government has put in place a £39 million capital commitment and provided significant additional current funding. While I accept that Members of the Opposition are sincere in their comments, they cannot run away from the fact that the £25 million provided in 1998 is double that provided in 1997 by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>We are all interested in the provision of properly planned, accessible and appropriate services for people with mental handicap.  The intellectual disability database provided us with a clear picture of what was needed in this area.  That database was developed and the assessment of needs document was published by the former Government. The document outlined a five year plan from 1997 to the year 2001.  The plan states that the Government must, during that five year period, provide 1,439 places on the residential side and 1,036 on the day side to meet the assessment of needs.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health stated that between 1997 and 1998, the first two years of the plan, more than 500 new residential places and 760 new day places have been provided, leaving a balance of 900 places on the residential/respite side and 300 on the day side.  I am very aware of the impact which the lack of residential places and, in particular, the lack of respite places has on the lives of people with a mental handicap and on their families and I am aware of the toll which waiting for such services places upon them.  I reiterate and endorse the comments made by the Minister yesterday; we all wish to be of assistance to those parents in working with them and the service providers to meet the needs which have been clearly identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> The Minister outlined the strategy which has been put in place to manage the development of new residential services.  Given the age profile of both the clients and their carers and the fact that we are, in effect, working through a backlog of needs, it is important that if progress is to be made quickly, effectively and in an equitable manner, everyone must be clear about the way forward.</P>
    <P>There are three main components involved in this issue.  The first relates to the management of emergency cases which will arise, the second relates to the provision of new residential places for those who have been assessed as requiring the service and the third relates to the provision of an increase in the level of respite care.  Since taking up office last year, this Government has already accelerated the pace at which the development of services to meet the needs identified in the assessment of needs document is moving.  The provision of additional funding of £25 million over a 12 month period is double that provided by the previous Government last year.</P>
    <P>One important aspect of the Minister's announcements during the past 12 months was the £30 million national capital programme, the first time such a programme was made available to the services.  It has already produced significant results such as the important announcement of £13 million for St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane.  I could not believe that Deputy Sargent, in whose constituency the hospital is based, did not have the grace to acknowledge that the £13 million investment will make a huge difference and has been welcomed by all involved.</P>
    <P>The pace of development under the programme will speed up in 1999, thanks to the Minister's action over the past 12 months which provided a total £30 million capital commitment.  It must be remembered that the previous Government did not make any capital allocation to support the five year plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke must not have known that the Minister for Education and Science made an announcement last week in regard to the education of children with special needs in terms of the provision of additional classroom assistants and resource teachers.</P>
    <P>The Government has clearly stated that the development of services to meet the needs of persons with a mental handicap, as outlined in the assessment of need document, is one of its priorities. The Minister has accorded priority to the development of these services since taking up office.  The evidence of this commitment has been concrete and it is the Government's intention to further accelerate the pace at which progress is being made to ensure residential, respite, day care and other support services are provided as quickly as possible within the timeframe outlined in the assessment of needs document and the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>I am enormously saddened by the fact that this Government, on the day on which the Estimates were published &mdash; a day of unbelievable riches, the likes of which this country has never previously seen &mdash; is actually opposing a joint Opposition motion.  I am shattered by that. We know the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs will be given extra money in the budget because she threatened to resign.  Why can the Government not accept this all-party Opposition motion?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State had the good grace to recognise we are sincere; I thank her for that patronising comment.  No previous Government has had the kind of money she now has at her disposal. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Finance banked £1,000 million against the national debt.  He should try telling that to the parents and children in the Gallery.  We are only seeking a fraction of the amount lodged to pay off our national mortgage.  The Minister of State, in her gratuitous and patronising contribution, stated the Government is accelerating the programme.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Brian O'Shea approached me when I was Minister for Finance, stating it was necessary to carry out an assessment of need in order to determine the real picture on this issue, I was advised by officials in the Department to be wary.  If the full picture were obtained, the Department would not have any defence and did not have any money to spend on services.  We did not have the kind of money the Government has now.</P>

      <P>The Minister should spend that money where it is required.  The real national debt this country has is to its people, to people who, through no fault of their own, enter into life with a handicap.  Their parents and siblings carry that responsibility for their entire lives and parents are forced to wonder what will happen when they can no longer handle that burden.  They wonder whether they can reasonably ask the siblings <Col N="908" /> who have lived with the reality of mental handicap to care for their brother or sister. Understandably, parents give a great deal of time to the person with the mental handicap but they agonise over whether they do that at a cost to their other children.  All of the Government's backbenchers &mdash; including those it bought on this side of the House &mdash; know the Government has the money to do something about this issue. Reinforced by this display of unity and his declarations of concern, the Minister should at least have the courage to look for the miserable extra few million pounds out of the £1 billion that was banked.  I urge the Government and the absent backbenchers whose votes have been bought and who have not had the courage to come into the House to do what we ask.  Previous Governments did not have the resources to do it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support the motion and compliment the parties which have attached their names to it and the Independent Members for supporting it.  The Government should be magnanimous and accede to it.  It should provide the £60 million being sought for mental handicap services.</P>
      <P>The manager of the centre run by the Brothers of Charity in Limerick is a good friend of mine. He has been highlighting the difficulties being experienced in respite and residential care services. He told me recently that when the Garda Síochána broke into a house they found that the elderly mother of a woman with a mental handicap had been dead for at least 24 hours.  There was no option but to admit to the centre the woman who had no understanding of what had happened.  Elderly persons are worried about what will happen to their next of kin when they pass on.  There was never a better time to respond to ease their pain.  The motion is timely.  The grudging attitude of Members opposite surprises me.</P>

      <P>The message of the carers in the public gallery is that they have laboured for too long on their own.  The burden is getting heavier and their children older.  If the Minister is of the view that there are greater priorities than those set out in the motion, he should ignore it.  If not, he has the power to respond positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion was tabled to focus on the recognised needs of those who suffer from a mental handicap and of their families and to seek all-party agreement that these should be addressed speedily and given the priority they deserve.  It is proposed in recognition that previous Governments did not have available to them the capital and current funding necessary to provide the essential comprehensive services required to fully meet the needs in this area.  It is our case that at a time of historic economic growth and when the Exchequer returns show a budget credit in excess of £1 billion we have a unique opportunity to put in place within a short <Col N="909" /> period the vital residential, respite and other services required, the absence of which adds to the great burden experienced by those caring for a mentally handicapped child or adult.</P>
      <P>All parties recognise the need for a £30 million national capital programme.  We are saying that there should be an allocation of this sum at this time to facilitate putting in place by the end of next year all the residential facilities necessary as recommended in the critical reports published which highlight the essential needs of the mentally handicapped.  It is the Government's case that it is acceptable to implement such a programme over a four or five year period.  We disagree. It is the Government's case that the current budget allocation in this area is adequate. We disagree and are calling for at least an additional £30 million in revenue funding for new services in areas such as education, training, sheltered and supported employment.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party believes social justice demands, in the context of the unprecedented increase in revenue returns, that specific social initiatives be taken to improve the quality of life of many of those not currently benefiting from our unprecedented economic growth.  Social patriotism demands in areas of deficiency that we reconstruct our health and education services and overcome the administrative, bureaucratic and institutional lethargy which traditionally is incapable of urgently addressing issues of social disadvantage.  The case we are making for the mentally handicapped can also be made for the physically handicapped.</P>
      <P>We hoped the debate would result in an agreement across the floor of the House to the terms of the motion and that this would result in the Government radically revising the timeframe within which the needs of the mentally handicapped would be catered for.  The Government's amendment to the motion refers to the commitments outlined in the programme for Government and Partnership 2000.  The Minister of State made a similar contribution.  At the time the programme was put together the extent of the success of the economy was not appreciated nor was the level of Exchequer returns for 1998 correctly predicted.  The response of the Minister and that of his colleague to the motion was extremely disappointing. It displays no understanding of the need for urgent action and the present day financial capacity to urgently act.  It displays no understanding of the individual burden experienced by elderly persons in caring for mentally handicapped children, many of whom have no quality of life as a result of the pressures and strains experienced by them in providing everyday care for those who suffer from a mental handicap or disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is not about whether the Government is committed to meeting the needs identified. It is about the Government recognising the urgency of those needs, identifying with and truly <Col N="910" /> understanding the real pressures experienced by those families caring for the mentally handicapped and acknowledging that they have a right to a better life.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what the Government is doing to meet the needs identified for &ldquo;this population group&rdquo;.  The use of such language betrays the reality that the mentally handicapped and their families are merely seen by the Minister as one of a variety of groups with needs which can be addressed over an extended period of years.  While it is the Minister's job to assess objectively the needs in a particular area, it should not be his role to emotionally neutralise the everyday reality for those who require better services nor should he portray them as some anonymous population group as opposed to individual men, women and children who are experiencing unacceptable difficulties and strains in their daily lives.  We need to humanise our politics. There is a need to move away from the institutional language used by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Members to alleviate the difficulties of the mentally handicapped and their families and meet their vital needs with the minimum possible delay.  The Estimates published today afforded the Minister a unique opportunity to address needs in this area.  We have discovered that not only will the Estimates for next year not allow the Minister to implement the proposals contained in the motion but that £32 million made available in revenue funding this year by the Department of Finance remains unspent and will not be spent.</P>

It is the duty of Members not just on the Opposition benches but also on the Government and Independent benches to give them the voice to which they are entitled and demand that the additional £60 million sought in the motion to provide essential services, including residential and respite facilities, be made available without delay.  They should immediately form part of the Government's programme for implementation before December 31 1999.</P>

      <P>For October, November and December of this year an average of 460 hospital beds will be closed in acute hospitals throughout the country.  This works out at approximately 1,400 beds over a three month period.  These bed closures are being effected due to the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to allocate adequate funds for acute hospital services this year.</P>
      <P>The bed closures are occurring at a time when hospital waiting lists continue to increase.  It is estimated that the current waiting list exceeds 36,500.  Incredibly, in the Estimates for Public Services published today, the Minister forecasts that his Department will spend £32 million less this year on non-capital services than was originally provided for at the start of the year.</P>
      <P>In simple terms the Minister has allowed hospital waiting lists to dramatically and indefensibly rise and hospital beds to close while he fiddles the sums in a Department and sits on a treasure chest of £32 million allocated to him at the beginning of the year by the Department of Finance.  His behaviour is quite extraordinary, even more so when one refers to the criticisms voiced by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, with regard to the hospital in Galway when he questioned the wisdom of the management decision to save £250,000.  We question the wisdom of the Minister in seeking to effect savings of £32 million when in the short period of his stewardship waiting lists have grown to a degree that is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>Tullamore General Hospital, the local hospital in the Minister's constituency, is one of the hospitals which will close beds in early December. In excess of 40 beds are scheduled to close in the hospital on 5 December.  The hospital has a substantial public waiting list for ENT and orthopaedic procedures, including hip and knee replacements.  As of 30 June 1998 there were 559 adults and 533 children on the public waiting list of the hospital for ENT procedures.  As of that date 580 patients were awaiting orthopaedic care, 119 awaiting total hip replacement and 24 total knee replacement.  As of 30 June 1998 a total of 1,737 patients were on the waiting lists of Tullamore General Hospital, an increase of almost 200 in the Minister's first year in office.  It can correctly be predicted that when available the new waiting list figures as of the end of September 1998 will show the figures have further increased.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s Tullamore General Hospital had two orthopaedic surgeons and regularly operated two theatres for orthopaedic operations such as hip replacement.  Today the hospital has three orthopaedic surgeons but only one theatre is available to them for surgery purposes.  The second theatre should be made available for orthopaedic surgery.</P>
      <P>I am demanding that the Minister take appropriate action not just in relation to Tullamore General Hospital but in relation to other hospitals across the country and that he immediately allocate the additional moneys required to prevent further closures of hospital beds in November and December to enable our acute services tackle the waiting lists which have escalated during his term of office.  If he does not do so he should explain to his constituents why he believes it is acceptable for hospital beds to close, for essential elective surgery to be further delayed and for his constituents to continue to suffer pain, distress and ill health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call of Deputy Shatter for the Minister for Health and Children to take appropriate action in the Midland Health Board area, with particular reference to the orthopaedic unit in Tullamore General Hospital. The Minister is as aware of the situation regarding waiting lists as I am.  The reality is that almost <Col N="917" /> 500 children in the Midland Health Board area, the bulk of whom come from the Laois-Offaly constituency, require urgent tonsillectomies. There are 170 adults awaiting hip operations in the Midland Health Board area where the average waiting time is now almost 20 months.</P>
      <P>The news announced last week that 48 beds in Tullamore General Hospital are to close for an extended Christmas holiday period, lasting from 5 December to 4 January, is totally unacceptable to the people of the midlands and in particular the Minister's constituents.  How can it be that an effort on the part of the board to reduce the waiting list is giving rise to a situation where it takes almost 20 months for a hip replacement to be carried out in the Midland Health Board area?  In what state will these waiting lists be on 5 January when the hospital reopens after an unprecedented and totally unacceptable Christmas break?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond in this debate.  It is well known that bed management forms a normal part of budgetary management strategy which must be examined in the context of actual hospital activity.  It should be noted that the Midland Health Board plans to carry out some necessary refurbishment during the period in question.  The board submitted a service plan to my Department which specified the amount of activity in respect of in-patient, out-patient and day procedures for the year, outlining the activity targets of the two hospitals, namely, Longford-Westmeath General Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital.</P>
      <P>On the basis of current trends and activities the board will have exceeded its baseline activity and will have met its waiting list initiative targets by the end of the year.  In this regard, I draw to the attention of the House the fact that this Government substantially increased the financial allocations to both hospitals over the allocations provided by the previous Administration.  In 1998, Longford-Westmeath General Hospital received £12.1 million from this Government compared to £10.5 million in 1997 from the previous Government. Tullamore General Hospital received £14.788 million in 1998 compared to £13.472 million in 1997.  In total, both hospitals received an increase in their allocations of £2.916 million in 1998 from this Government compared to the funding allocated in 1997 by the previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final weeks of the year, between 5 December and 5 January, the board proposes to scale down activity in two of its hospitals, Tullamore General Hospital and Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar.  I stress again that activity will have exceeded targets set out in the service plan in relation to baseline activity and will have met targets in relation to waiting list activity.  It is important to emphasise that the hospitals concerned will deal with all emergency and urgent cases.  The board will assess the situation <Col N="918" /> on a daily basis and if the level of emergency and urgent cases dictates, additional beds will be opened as required.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Shatter might have us believe, there is no question of any person who may require medical treatment not being given adequate care and attention.  The Government is committed to providing a high quality acute hospital service in the Midland Health Board area.  I am confident the level and quality of service being provided by the board will continue to be delivered to the people living in the catchment areas of Tullamore General Hospital and Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.  I will visit both Mullingar and Portlaoise this Friday.  I am committed to an enhanced capital development programme which obviously has increased revenue implications in the long term for the delivery of services in the Midland Health Board.  The commitment of this Government has shown we have an ability to provide more services in that health board area than was the case with my predecessor.</P>
    <P>It will always be the case that Deputies will come into this House seeking additional funding regardless of budgets or allocations.  We had a three hour debate which concluded tonight calling for more services in community based services such as mental handicap.  I agree with that but the Deputies have come back into the House tonight calling for more services in acute hospitals.  They want more services in every area of activity despite the fact that the allocations being made by me are greatly in excess of those they provided when in Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn made an extraordinary statement this evening to the effect that this was the first time we had an opportunity to provide resources.  As Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn brought in three budgets totalling £40,000 million yet he has the gall to come in here and say this is the first opportunity we have had to provide for the development of services.</P>

      <P>I assure my constituency colleague, Deputy Flanagan, that during the course of my tenure in office he will see greatly enhanced development in the Midland Health Board area.  I point out to him that half of the total money available to me last year for the commissioning of new units went to Mullingar &mdash; £1.2 million out of an allocation for the whole country of £2.4 million.  I look forward to opening the hospital next Friday in Mullingar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>; I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this matter.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Cowen, also for sending representatives to meet members of the South Eastern Health Board at my request.</P>
      <P>When rumours first circulated regarding the imminent closure of the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene, my immediate concern was for the patients and staff of the hospital.  Some time ago the South Eastern Health Board decided on a three year programme under which the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene would be closed down, elective surgery would be transferred to Waterford Regional Hospital and trauma services would be carried out in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The staff of the hospital met with the chief executive officer on Friday, 5 December 1997 to discuss the proposals for Kilcreene Hospital, that is, the sale of the hospital and the transfer of services. He reassured the staff that contracts of employment would not change; equal status would be given to posts in Kilkenny city applying to both temporary and permanent staff; theatre staff would be accommodated at St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny; redeployment of staff would not take place until the new unit was ready at St. Luke's Hospital and refresher courses and training would be provided for staff.  Unfortunately, following a recent visit by senior management of the South Eastern Health Board, it was indicated that this programme had changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there should be any consideration to close the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene which is located on a beautiful site.  The hospital has an excellent record of achievement. Compared to similar hospitals in a stand alone situation like Cappagh, the orthopaedic hospital <Col N="920" /> in Kilcreene could be just as good if it had the same medical back-up.</P>
    <P>When one considers the improvements carried out in the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene in recent years, the question must be asked if we are getting value for money.  I am aware that major works have been carried out in the orthopaedic hospital over recent years.  The kitchen has been fully outfitted, a new pharmacy and elaborate computer centre were provided, a clinic has been refurbished at a cost of £250,000 and the canteen has been reconstructed.  That money was spent at a time when people were deciding that the future of the hospital was no longer viable and that it would close.</P>
    <P>I attended a public function with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who came to Kilkenny to open the orthopaedic clean air theatre at St. Luke's Hospital, which cost in excess of £1 million.  That theatre remains locked up today and there are questions to be asked in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to pose some other questions in relation to the orthopaedic hospital.  A total of £100,000 of maintenance money was allocated earlier this year which has not been spent.  That money should have been spent during the month of August when most of the ward closures occurred. It has not been spent and that is a deliberate attempt to run down the hospital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to investigate the questions I have raised and ensure that answers are provided. Furthermore, will the Minister of State indicate the number of operations that have been carried out in the hospital since 1 September?  How many public and private operations were carried out by the seven consultants attached to this regional hospital?  How many patients are on the waiting lists?  Are we getting value for money?  I hope some of these questions will be answered in detail and that the Minister will send his representatives again to investigate the future viability of the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene.  On behalf of the staff and patients I invite the Minister to visit the hospital because I am not satisfied it has got a fair deal in the proposals that have been put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by Deputy Aylward to address the House this evening on future proposals for the Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital at Kilcreene, Kilkenny, and acknowledge the Deputy's interest in this issue.  As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthopaedic services is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. In this context, the House will be aware that in September 1997 the board unanimously adopted a plan for the Kilkenny Hospital system that involved the rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city onto the St. Luke's Hospital site.  This plan involved the development of existing services in St. Luke's; the addition of new specialities of acute psychiatry, paediatrics <Col N="921" /> and geriatrics, including a long-stay unit; the further development of community services and the provision of a community hospital to support the acute hospital.</P>
      <P>A central element of this plan for the development of an integrated hospital service for Counties Kilkenny and Carlow involves the transfer of elective orthopaedics from Kilcreene to Waterford Regional Hospital.  This is in line with the conclusions of a major review of orthopaedic services in the region completed in 1992 by a joint Department of Health-Comhairle na nOspidéal expert review group.  The review group concluded that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in the best interests of patient care, elective orthopaedics in the South Eastern Health Board region should be centralised in Waterford Regional Hospital, which is being developed as the flagship hospital and tertiary referral centre for the health board area.  . . the review group is convinced that an opportunity now exists to dramatically improve the orthopaedic service to the people of the South East by centralising both the trauma and elective services at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>I note that Deputy Aylward disagreed with some of the findings and this may give us an opportunity to review the situation in light of what he has been saying about the operation of the orthopaedic unit in Kilcreene.</P>
      <P>The full implementation of the Kilkenny Hospital Plan will require progress on a number of fronts.  Central among these is the need to provide suitable accommodation at Waterford Regional Hospital for the transfer of elective orthopaedic services there.  In view of the complexities inherent in co-ordinating the implementation of the plan, a planning group, involving officials, medical and nursing staff of the South Eastern Health Board and officials of my Department, has now been established to draw up an implementation timetable, a priority list for the developments and to work on costings.  I understand this group will meet on 24 November and it is hoped it will have completed its work by early 1999 with a view to establishing a project team or teams by May 1999.</P>
      <P>In tandem with this, I understand that a joint management-unions group has also been established to develop career options and provide career guidance, advice and training, as necessary, for nurses and other staff at Kilcreene who will be affected by the impending changes.  In the meantime, elective orthopaedic procedures will continue to be performed at the hospital while this process of phased implementation, in consultation with all relevant interests, is under way.  As the Deputy said, this may provide an opportunity for us to consider the cost effectiveness of the operation.</P>
      <P>In this context, the South Eastern Health Board is conscious of the short-term infrastructural needs of the hospital pending the full transfer of services under the Kilkenny plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> I understand the board approved the expenditure of a sum of £100,000 on ongoing maintenance works at the hospital at its June 1998 meeting and the board is now progressing these much needed works with the appointment of a contractor this week.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the overriding aim is to ensure that the transfer of services from Kilcreene is achieved in a structured and workable manner that best serves the interests of both patients and staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the planning work now under way can achieve this to the benefit of health providers and users in the south eastern region.  As I have said, in view of the strong representations made by Deputy Aylward on the financial viability of both hospitals, we will look again at this problem.</P>

      <P>I speak tonight for the children in Cork South Central who are suffering from the curse of drug abuse.  Why is the Government refusing to help them?  In my first speech in Dáil Éireann, I want to impress upon the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science, though he is not here, the urgent need to fund a specialist drug treatment programme for adolescent children in Cork.</P>
      <P>Drug dealers today are targeting younger and younger children.  Pushers lie in wait outside schoolyards &mdash; sometimes even primary school-yards &mdash; for their innocent victims.  Drug addiction is no longer confined to adults or even people in their late teens or early twenties.  The drug culture now ensnares children in their early teens, who may be 12 and 13 years old.  To those who do not recognise this I say that they have their heads in the sand and are completely out of touch with the drug problem.  While the victims become younger, the dealers become more efficient and more organised.  Unfortunately, we have to tackle evil, calculating people who are perfecting the art of picking off the most vulnerable children in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day somebody's young son or daughter in Cork becomes a drug addict and becomes a child that is out of control with educational, emotional and behavioural problems.  These children desperately need treatment.  In Cork at present we have an extraordinary situation. We have three specially equipped treatment centres for young drug abusers that are lying idle because there is no money available to fund them: Garryvoe in east Cork, Ahiohill in west Cork and Trabeg in Douglas in Cork city. These centres are part of a model of adolescent drug treatment that works; it is based on 20 years of research and experience.  They are <Col N="923" /> fully equipped and ready to reopen; their 30 beds are all empty.</P>
    <P>This programme allows children who desperately need help to be taken out of the surroundings that lead them astray.  It educates children on how to re-enter society in a positive way and then monitors their progress.  This programme of treatment works so efficiently that in the last three years referrals were taken from Dublin, Mayo, Sligo, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The treatment works.  Yet due to a lack of funding, the centres had to close last November. Everyone connected with combating drug abuse in Cork wants these centres re-opened: parents of addicts, addicts who have come through treatment, local councillors, the Garda, the drugs task force unit in Cork, the Southern Health Board and drug counsellors who have parents crying over the phone asking for help.</P>
    <P>Why will the Government not act?  Children should not have to wait for the drug treatment, particularly in Cork: the facility is already there. The research, buildings, expertise and staff are all there.  All that is needed is funding.</P>
    <P>The funding is not that substantial &mdash; £900,000 pounds will fund these three centres per annum. We have a system that can save children's lives. Next week is European Drug Prevention Week. If ever there was a suitable time to announce funding for these centres, next week is the time. These children's, lives are worth more than £1 million.  Will we see the money coming to them?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for raising this matter and congratulate him on his maiden speech on such an important topic.</P>
      <P>Provision of drug treatment services in the Cork area is primarily the responsibility of the Southern Health Board, which has developed a comprehensive alcohol and drugs strategy which aims to assess and measure the extent of the problem, strengthen links with health services and other agencies, generate a community response and develop appropriate services.</P>
      <P>The board has established a co-ordination forum on alcohol and drug misuse which is drawn from a cross-section of agencies within the health board and action taken to date in the provision of services includes the enhancement of drugs education and awareness programmes, the development of Arbour House, training for general practitioners and the improvement of data collection.</P>
      <P>Drug treatment services for adolescents are mainly provided on an out-patient basis with the appropriate counselling, support and rehabilitation provided to young people and their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This out-patient model is in the main mode of national treatment.  Beidh freagra <Col N="924" /> agat i gceann nóiméad.  It is recognised that where young people can be treated in their own area with the support of parents or local voluntary and community groups, this results in successful treatment outcomes.</P>
      <P>For a small number of adolescents, however, it is acknowledged that in-patient facilities are required.  The health board has been working with Matt Talbot Services in Cork which has identified the resources necessary to establish residential treatment facilities for adolescents at three locations run by this group.  These facilities would cater for out of control young people with a range of problems including addiction.  Representatives of Matt Talbot Services have met with my colleagues the Minister, Deputy Martin, and Ministers of State, Deputies Flood, Fahey and Dan Wallace, together with officials from my Department.  There is agreement that there is a cross-service dimension to this proposal.  I am aware that the assessment committee for the allocation of the youth services development fund is examining the proposal with a view to the provision of seed funding for the project.  The Southern Health Board is supportive of this project and its financial contribution to the programme will be decided in the context of the board's overall allocation for drugs services in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  Every Member will recall instances where Departments have done ridiculous, foolish and occasionally stupid things.  This is one such occasion.  The children who attend the school catering for the local Church of Ireland community in the Clane area had free transport for the past seven to nine years.  Suddenly some guru in the Department decided he or she would earn themselves the eternal gratitude of someone somewhere I do not know.  He or she decided the children lived 200 yards or thereabouts nearer to another school which is outside the parish.  It should be possible even for the Department of Education and Science to realise there is such a thing as a parish community which is important to people of all religions.  It is not a simple or easy matter to decide to take one's children away from that school and send them, in accordance with the wishes of a Department, to another school which is outside their radius and away from their friends.  I regard that as a daft decision but the next part is the daftest I have ever heard. There is no saving to the Department because the same school bus travels on the same route it has always travelled, except it has six or seven fewer passengers.  It was not full previously nor is it full now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is the type of person who would love to get his teeth into such a problem and resolve it.  I have no <Col N="925" /> doubt he can resolve it.  I put it in the simple words of a parent of one of the children who said: &ldquo;This is a stupid situation.  We have three children in Hewetsons school.  My eldest son has been attending for the last seven years and has been using the bus with a free pass since he started.  Celbridge (the alternative school which has been referred to) is still in the same place now as it was when my child started school.  (That is a strange confirmation of the obvious if ever there was one).  It has not come any nearer to us so I cannot understand why there is a change in policy&rdquo;.  That is a simple reaction from a parent to something that is obvious to her, to me and I am sure to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. She concluded by saying: &ldquo;The children make up one third of the group in the bus.  The bus comes near to our stop for another child and it only comes half a mile off the route to collect our children&rdquo;. If it did not come that half mile off the route the problem would not arise.  It does not seem a good business policy for the Department to run a bus to Hewetsons school which is only half full and ask the parents to switch to another school, for which it says it cannot provide a bus service in any event but the parents are expected to provide it.</P>
    <P>The case speaks for itself.  I could make other pertinent points but I will not do so.  I will leave it to the discretion of the Minister to take the problem by the scruff of the neck and say, &ldquo;Enough is enough of that sort of nonsense, we intend to resolve the problem and restore the status quo&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Coveney and wish him many successful years in this House.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter. By way of general comment I shall explain some basic facts about how the school transport scheme operates.  Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  My Department has responsibility to ensure the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on this service.  It does not come cheap.  In 1997, the net cost to the State was in excess of £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, eligibility is determined by reference to age and distance from the nearest suitable school, not on the basis of parish boundaries.  To be eligible for free transport, children under ten years of age must live at <Col N="926" /> least two miles from, and be attending, the nearest national school.  Older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
    <P>For the children in question, eligibility is determined by reference to the nearest school under Protestant management.  In all cases, the exact distance is measured by Bus Éireann, taking the shortest route.  My Department would not allow free transport to children who are ineligible under the terms of the scheme.  This would lead to much higher demand from other applicants in similar circumstances throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Where children do not quality for free transport they may be allowed fare-paying facilities. This is subject to there being spare seats available and no additional State cost being involved.  The current charge for primary fare-paying transport is £20 per pupil per term.</P>
    <P>The children in question travelled free on the understanding that they were attending their nearest suitable school.  However, it came to the attention of Bus Éireann and my Department earlier this year that these pupils reside nearer to Celbridge Church of Ireland national school.  In the circumstances, these children could no longer be considered eligible for free transport to Hewetsons school.</P>
    <P>That these pupils travelled free contrary to the terms of the scheme in no way confers a continuing right to the facility.  While being sympathetic to the needs of the families concerned, the Department has to consider the wider implications for school transport as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines which would have financial and policy implications for the scheme throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The relevant families were advised in March 1998 that free transport could not be offered beyond the Easter term but that they would be allowed fare-paying transport.  My Department subsequently re-examined the position at the request of the families concerned but, unfortunately, was not in a position to reinstate free transport.</P>
    <P>I understand one of the parents contacted my Department again within the past fortnight, appealing the decision on the basis of distance. The parent measured the distance herself and found Hewetsons school to be nearer to her home than the Celbridge school.  My Department has pursued the matter through Bus Éireann which is in the process of having the inspector recheck the mileage as requested.  Bus Éireann will provide a report in this regard as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is understood there have been some recent changes to the road network in the area which could possibly affect the relevant mileage.  If Bus Éireann confirms that Hewetsons school is the nearest, when taking the shortest route, my Department and I would be pleased to reinstate free transport as requested.  However, if Celbridge is still found to be nearer to these families' <Col N="927" /> homes, it is regretted that concessionary fare-paying transport is the most that could be offered in this instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan will be informed of the outcome of that re-examination.  I have no doubt if it does not come down in favour of the parents <Col N="928" /> he will be in touch with us again and we will look at the situation afresh at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment meets on average every six to eight weeks and has met on 30 occasions since its inception in October 1995.  The most recent meeting took place on 15 September and this was followed by a meeting with the social partners on 23 October to discuss labour market policy in the context of the forthcoming budget.  These and other issues were explored further at the Partnership 2000 plenary meeting on 28 October.</P>
      <P>The group is examining at present the operation of active labour market policies in the light of changing labour market conditions and the aims and strategies set out in the National Employment Action Plan.  This examination will also take into account the various reviews of labour market intervention measures either completed, under way or planned.  It is envisaged that this work will determine the agenda for future meetings of the group both for the remainder of this year and the early months of next year.</P>

      <P>At my request, the IFSC clearing house group is preparing a strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.  This strategy will primarily focus on the need to maximise the level of sustainable economic activity and employment in international financial services in Ireland, building upon the existing activity in the IFSC.  This should encompass not only the number of jobs, but also the quality of employment and activity, and the possibility of enhancing sustainability through links to related sectors such as shared services and electronic commerce.  The strategy will outline a clear vision for the Government to adopt and implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy will address issues concerning: the future location of the industry and the provision of infrastructure for the continued growth of the IFSC; the future marketing and promotion of the sector; how to ensure a continued supply of skilled employees for IFSC companies; the need for a tax regime supportive of competitiveness, while recognising EU and domestic constraints; measures to enhance the competitiveness of the centre through company law legislation; the need to maintain the existing high standard of regulation <Col N="934" /> of the industry; the implications of the introduction of the euro; new business opportunities based around the existing level of financial services activity in the centre and the structures necessary to implement the strategy.</P>
    <P>There have been recent discussions at international and EU level on the international community's response to the crisis in financial markets. The Government has participated in these discussions and the crisis remains a matter of serious concern to Ireland given the open nature of our economy.</P>
    <P>The impact of recent turbulence on world financial markets will also be taken into account in the strategy being prepared by the IFSC clearing house group.  This strategy will recognise the need for a flexible response to emerging international problems.  The centre is still highly competitive and has limited exposure to the countries most affected.  In my view, the most effective response to these events is to enhance the already strong competitive position of the IFSC and that will be a key objective of the strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> My speech at the inaugural meeting of the NESC on 4 November 1998 has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In my address, I asked the council to prepare a new strategy report which would form the basis for a successor to Partnership 2000.  I suggested that this should reflect a vision for Ireland as an economy and as a society over a ten year period and should outline the steps to be taken within a three year programme to progress that vision.  This should take account, in particular, of globalisation, EMU and the need to modernise our systems for managing domestic policy issues.  I invited the council to explore innovative solutions to tackle problems such as the tightening labour market and the opportunities created by a sharp easing of the population dependency ratio for the next decade or so.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 has over a year to run and, therefore, the Government, properly, is focused on implementing the current agreement.  This approach, however, is being complemented by putting in place the necessary arrangements to prepare a basis upon which a new programme may be negotiated with the social partners.  The work of the NESC and the NESF is an important contribution to that process.</P>
    <P>Substantive discussions have not yet commenced on a successor to Partnership 2000. However, I signalled in my address to the P2000 plenary meeting in July, and again at the inaugural meeting of the NESC, that there is a need to develop a new approach to the management of public sector pay.  I suggested that we need to consider how a policy of more closely relating pay to performance can meet the aspirations of public servants, while maintaining the unavoidable limits on public spending.  The Government is prepared to explore the options by which this might most effectively be achieved.  I envisage that discussion will commence on these issues with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions following the budget.</P>

      <P>The quarterly national household survey was introduced in September 1997, replacing the annual labour force survey.  The purpose of the survey is to provide quarterly detailed statistics on the labour force and to produce periodic reports on social themes.  Processing and publication of survey results are still at a developmental stage.  To date, one survey release has been issued by the CSO, containing labour force details for the fourth quarter of 1997. The next release, scheduled for publication at the end of this month, will contain results for the first two quarters of 1998.  The ultimate target is to <Col N="937" /> produce quarterly reports within three months of the end of each quarter and CSO expects to meet this objective during 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is in the process of establishing a national millennium committee which I will chair.  The committee is to examine and make recommendations on contributing towards the funding of a small number of significant national projects which have been proposed as millennium projects.  In addition, it will examine and recommend a system for supporting, including funding, commemorative projects at a community, local, county or regional level, in order to provide local communities, including in areas of social disadvantage, with an opportunity to participate in the commemoration of the millennium.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the work of the national millennium committee will be supported by a small millennium office to be established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will also be responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's overall millennium programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Government will announce details of the national millennium committee shortly.  The exact funding to be made available for millennium projects and the operation of the millennium office will also be announced in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the commemoration committee, to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>As you know it was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the United Irishmen and the &ldquo;fellowship of freedom&rdquo; that inspired them in 1798.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this in mind it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism <Col N="938" /> which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the International Conference, 1798 A Bicentenary Perspective, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments 1798 Commemoration Scholarship and the RTE Documentary Series &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; are examples of projects funded which duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
    <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tones Diaries and the Drennan Papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's film festival was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme From Revolution to Reconciliation.  The development of the Croppies Acre Site at Collins Barracks as a memorial garden is under way and will be opened by me on 22 November.</P>
    <P>We can all agree that the 1798 Centre at Enniscorty, which I opened earlier this year, is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the last ten months to mark the rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by me and involving the French military and our own Defence Force's took place in Ballina on the 22 of August to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects throughout the country.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately given the limited budget available it was not possible to fund all of the many worthy projects under way throughout the country and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the local committees who worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success. I also thank my committee for all its work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

The proposed sales of these barracks will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial development needs in the areas concerned.  In addition, 15 per cent of the proceeds are to be devoted to community projects in the areas involved.  This is a consultative process involving many Departments, agencies, councils and organisations, including my Department.  The details-arrangements still require to be sorted out.</P>

The question of using Baldonnel Aerodrome for the provision of a non-military aviation service is appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, the feasibility of the use of the facilities at Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes consistent with its primary use as a military installation requires close liaison between both Departments on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The school has, down the years, provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, while acknowledging the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have been a consistent feature of international teams over many years.  Army riders have also participated with distinction in Olympic Games, most recently at Seoul in 1988 and Los Angeles in 1984.</P>
      <P>The equitation school has at present two horses which are competing at international level and which are expected to be suitable for consideration for selection for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.  The selection of horses for the Irish team travelling to Sydney will be made by the international committee of the Show Jumping Association of Ireland in the period leading up to the commencement of the games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department continues to source high quality Irish bred horses for the Army Equitation School for competition at home and abroad and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.  Funding for the Army Equitation School is currently provided from the national lottery.  There is a total allocation of £550,000 available this year which includes a provision of £260,000 in respect of the purchase of horses.  I am committed to maintaining funding <Col N="941" /> at existing levels in the coming year and also to continue to explore possibilities to ensure that horses of the appropriate standard will be available to the equitation school for possible selection on an Irish showjumping team which, it is hoped, will travel to Sydney in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>There are at present a total of 88 flying officers in the Air Corps.  Eleven Air Corps cadets were recently recruited.  There are also a total of ten senior cadets in their second year of training who are due to be commissioned as fully trained flying officers in 1999.</P>
      <P>The ongoing training of cadets combined with the introduction of the service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots which was introduced in 1997, is designed to help alleviate the difficulties in regard to pilot numbers which have arisen due to the unprecedented level of retirements from the Air Corps in the past year.  The question of training non-commissioned personnel as pilots will be further examined in the context of implementing the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report.  It is open to non-commissioned personnel to apply for Air Corps cadetships and a number of such personnel have been commissioned in the past having successfully completed cadetships.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 56, 107, 114, 119, 151, 159, 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defences Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally.  The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the immediate sale of the barracks. Some 60 per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment.  The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place.  The proposed sales will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial development needs in the areas concerned.  In addition, 15 per cent of the proceeds are to be devoted to community projects in <Col N="943" /> the areas involved.  This is a consultative process involving many Departments, agencies, councils and organisations, including my Department. While preliminary discussions have taken place with local community groups, various details and arrangements still require to be sorted out.  The Government remains committed to the development of the Defence Forces as a modern and effective organisation staffed and equipped to effectively fulfil the roles assigned to them and to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to complete the training of the existing 28 apprentices at the Curragh Camp.

Discussions are taking place with the civilian teachers with a view to moving them to the Curragh to complete the off the job training of the apprentices.</P>
      <P>At the height of its operations the Army Apprentice School accommodated up to 180 apprentices but the need to recruit apprentices has reduced considerably in recent years.  Accordingly, the facilities being provided at the Curragh Camp are to accommodate the current number of apprentices and will be used in the longer term as general training facilities.</P>
      <P>Military personnel previously based at Devoy Barracks, Naas, have already relocated to the Curragh Camp, and some of these personnel continue to be involved in the training of the apprentices.</P>
      <P>Some discussions were held with the Department of Education and Science regarding the possible use of Devoy Barracks for apprentice training by the Department.

      <P>The Department completed its most recent review of Civil Defence in consultation with each local authority in 1992 This process involved consultation at root and branch level in the organisation and resulted in the launch of the Towards 2000 Programme for Civil Defence.  This programme includes: stewarding; providing an enhanced search and rescue capability; river, lake and coastal area search and recovery; major and radiological emergencies and environmental problems; flooding, blizzards and forest fire-fighting problems and evacuee reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> The current strategic objectives agreed for the Department of Defence provide for a second phase development process for the 32 local authority civil defence elements for the period up to 2000 and beyond.  In line with these agreed objectives local authority managers have been requested to submit their development plans in line with their local requirements.  This process is already under way and in preparation for this development I met with all the Civil Defence officers and assistant Civil Defence officers on 11 June 1998 to discuss future planning for the organisation.  The Civil Defence officers were encouraged to discuss their plans and proposals with volunteers so that there would be a high level of involvement.</P>
    <P>In the context of the White Paper on Defence, submissions were invited on Civil Defence also and I am aware that proposals have been received in this regard.  I welcome these developments.  I also propose to update the legislative basis for Civil Defence to enable it to more fully fulfil its defined roles and I would hope to have this process completed by mid-1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 77, 95, 142 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Defence and the Chief State Solicitor's Office had correspondence and a number of meetings earlier this year with the Law <Col N="946" /> Society and with some of the individual solicitors concerned.  The general purpose of our communications was to examine the level of legal fees and whether economies, particularly in the case of those firms of solicitors who are acting for a large number of plaintiffs in similar cases, could be achieved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of fees, I was told that the solicitors concerned were already substantially discounting fees in these cases.  I remain convinced that there is further room for reduction.  If and when a lower and more acceptable tariff in these cases is achieved allowing me to establish a non-court system of compensation, I will press for further discounts in the level of legal fees charged in these cases.  In the meantime the State is in discussion with a number of solicitors to establish whether it is possible to achieve block settlements at reasonable rates.  These discussions also include the issue of reduced legal fees.  In any case where fees appear inordinate, the Chief State Solicitor applies to the Taxing Master of the High Court for an adjudication.</P>

      <P>I have received a report from the United Nations regarding alleged abuses of duty free privileges by members of the Permanent Defence Force serving with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP.  The report is an internal document of the United Nations and I am advised that it cannot be made public.

      <P>The framework for negotiations with the representative associations, including PDFORRA, is set out in the conciliation and arbitration scheme to which both associations and the Department subscribe. This scheme also sets out the range of subjects which come within the scope of representation. The successful operation of the scheme requires both sides to adopt a realistic and constructive attitude.  In any industrial relations forum, tensions may arise if either side approaches the negotiating table with unobtainable expectations on issues which fall outside the parameters of the C &amp; A scheme.</P>

As part of the Defence Forces restructuring and reorganisation process, a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the FCA and the Slua Muirí, is taking place at present.  In that regard there is a consultative process in train which is intended to elicit the views of serving members of the reserve on the future development of the organisation. The representative bodies are also involved in this process.  It is anticipated that the study of the Reserve Defence Force will be completed in early 1999 and in the meantime no new plans for the FCA will be formulated.</P>

    <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 August 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, was 11,701.  The requirement for specialist personnel in the Defence Forces is met through a combination of the training and education of newly recruited and serving Defence Force personnel and the induction of suitably qualified personnel through direct entry competitions. In addition, a number of suitably qualified non-commissioned personnel have recently been commissioned as air traffic control officers.  It is also proposed to commission suitably qualified non-commissioned personnel to serve in the <Col N="949" /> information technology area shortly.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 was adopted by Government in February 1996.  The implementation process is ongoing and it is expected that the first phase of the implementation plan will be completed by the end of 1998.  I am very satisfied with the rate of progress of the implementation plan.  Earlier this month, the new Army structure was introduced, comprising three brigades and the Defence Forces Training Centre and on 30 November, the third and final phase of a scheme of voluntary early retirement for PDF personnel will conclude. In recent months the report of the studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service has been published, the Defence Act, 1954, has been amended and the Government has approved the closure of a number of military barracks.  In addition, the White Paper process has gathered increasing momentum, with the invitation of submissions from members of the public and the establishment of a threat assessment group.  The process of reform of the Defence Forces is set to continue by means of the implementation plans for the reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval <Col N="950" /> Service which will be drawn up shortly and through the White Paper on Defence which will be completed next year.</P>

      <P>The total amount currently due to my Department by the United Nations in respect of Defence Force personnel serving overseas is approximately £9 million.  The amount of arrears due at October last year was £10.6 million.  The amount paid to the State in 1997 in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Irish Defence Force personnel in UN missions was £8.2 million.  The comparative figure for 1996 was £7.3 million.  Troop costs included in the above figures are calculated at the rate of US$1087.10 per person per month. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Interim Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) are the only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 62, 87, 100, 105, 144, 149, 160 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>By 30 October, a total number of 13,639 claims for army hearing loss compensation had been received in my Department.  Of this number, court awards following hearing have been made in 124 cases while a further 106 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Out of court settlements have been reached in a total of 1,745 cases.  11,664 claims are therefore still outstanding. New claims are still currently arriving at an average rate of 50 per week, with a total of 2,749 received to date in 1998.  About 30 per cent of claims received to date have been from serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The amounts paid out to date are: £2.4 million in respect of 124 court awards; £41.5 million in respect of 1,745 out of court settlements; and, £12.25 million in respect of 1,401 claims where legal costs have been paid to date.  The total cost to date is close to £56 million.  Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and, £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitors Office.  A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, £2,395,000 per year.  A provision of £70 million will be provided in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Cost projections for the likely eventual cost of Army hearing loss litigation have fluctuated up and down over the past number of years, particularly as various &ldquo;milestones&rdquo; have been reached. Given the current and potential scale of the problem, allied to the complex legal and medical variables, it is impossible to give an accurate computation of the future cost.  What is clear however, regardless of how the problem is approached, is that the State is facing a cost burden of huge magnitude.</P>
    <P>In light of the award made in the Hanley test case last July, my Department has estimated that the cost for loss of hearing on over 11,500 claims which are currently outstanding is of the order of £550 million.  If legal costs and damages for matters such as loss of earnings are included, the potential bill is of the order of one billion pounds. The effect of this cost on the public finances will be damaging beyond reasonable acceptance.  Such damage is not acceptable to the Government and nor do I believe is it acceptable to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent Supreme Court decision in the case of Smith v Minister for Defence, I was clearly pleased that the court upheld the State's appeal and referred the matter back to the High Court.  First, I understand that the court stated that the case in question was heard in the High Court before the passing of the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998.  Deputies will recall that this was the legislation which required that judicial notice should be taken of the Green Book method of hearing disability assessment.  The court stated that before its introduction there was no measurement system which the courts could regard as fair, just and reasonable between both parties.  Second, the court stated that just because a person has been in the Army and has been exposed to gunfire noise without ear protection does not mean that a person is automatically entitled to damages.</P>
    <P>While this judgment will not resolve the Army hearing loss issue, I am nonetheless interpreting it as being favourable to the Government's position on this issue.  In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring that appropriate compensation is paid in deserving cases.  However, I do not believe that the taxpayer would wish to see the Government preside over the payment of large amounts to persons who have little or no perceptible disability. I would hope in this regard that the Supreme Court judgment would be particularly noted by persons who think there is a handy compensation bonus due to them just because they served with the Defence Forces.  There are no changes in legislation being brought by my Department at this time.  The procedures for dealing with claims are under ongoing review, particularly in response to jurisprudence laid down by the courts.</P>

      <P>In my speech at the commissioning ceremony of the 36th Naval Cadet Class at the Naval Base, Haulbowline on 3 September 1998, I focused on the achievements of the three naval officers who had worked so hard to achieve their commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of my speech, I also referred to the challenging roles the Naval Service presents to its personnel working as they do on <Col N="954" /> the high seas, sometimes in very severe weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and Naval Service and made the point that implementation of the recommendations in the report will lead to a stable future for both services.  I said that there are many recommendations in the report which would be acted on immediately and which would not have to await the White Paper on Defence.  On recruitment, I announced that up to 200 extra recruits are to be taken on in the Defence Forces, of which 70 were to be allocated specifically to the Naval Service.  In addition, 14 Naval Service cadetships had just been offered to successful candidates and advertisements were appearing from 3 September 1998 for the filling of 17 apprenticeship posts in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>On new investment, I said that the new Naval Service ship would be ready in September 1999. The new galley in the base at a cost of £2 million is almost complete and tenders had been received in the Department of Defence for the upgrading of the medical centre in the base at a cost of £400,000.</P>
    <P>During a press conference following my speech, I made the point that all personnel in the Naval Service should concentrate on the positive image of the service rather than on highlighting its weakness.  If such weaknesses exist, then it was up to the Naval Service personnel to come forward with solutions in these problems.</P>

      <Quest>the basis on which a case was settled involving a claim by a person (details supplied); the procedures now in place in the Defence Forces to deal with possible cases of post-traumatic stress disorder; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>This case involved a claim in respect of hearing impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder.  It was settled on the basis of the risk of a court award as advised by senior council.  In assessing quantum, consideration was given to the claim alleging hearing impairment only.  Settlement was on a &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; basis and liability was never conceded on any issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to post-traumatic stress disorder generally, it has been always been recognised that military personnel may be exposed to traumatic situations leading to what has in the past been described as &ldquo;battle stress disorder&rdquo;.  Indeed, one of the aims of military training is to create a sense of comradeship and mutual support to enable personnel to cope with the stress which is an inevitable part of military operations from time to time.  Support from commanders, from the medical corps and from the chaplaincy service have always been available when required.  In more recent times, following developments in the medical sciences which have led to the identification of what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder, procedures have been put in place which formalise these traditional support systems throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces now operate a stress management and post-traumatic stress disorder programme the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support to personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner.  This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the personnel support service and the chaplaincy service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are referred in the first instance to the military psychiatrist at St. Bricin's Military Hospital.  A multi-disciplinary approach to case management is generally adopted and is led by a psychiatrist.  The team may include nurses and Army nursing service with training in counselling skills, social workers of the personnel support service, the chaplaincy service and appropriate colleagues. <Col N="956" /> The psychiatrist may also refer cases to civilian agencies, particularly clinical psychologists, if he feels that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>In October, 1997 the Chief of Staff established a military board comprising officers drawn from Defence Forces Headquarters, the command FCA staffs, the Naval Service and the Air Corps to conduct a study of the Reserve Defence Force as recommended in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan.  The Chief of Staff also established a consultative group for the purpose of assisting the military board in its examination of the reserve.  The consultative group consists of one officer and one non-commissioned officer from each of the four commands and the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>To date the military board has met on approximately 50 occasions and with a view to completing its deliberations at an early date is meeting twice weekly at present.  The board also met with the consultative group on three occasions.  These meetings took the form of weekend seminars. The board submitted an interim report to the Chief of Staff earlier this year and it is anticipated that the board's final report will be submitted to the Chief of Staff before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In January, 1998 I set up a joint civilian-military steering group to oversee and guide the military board study.  The steering group has eight members &mdash; an independent chairman, three senior civil servants, three senior military officers and a serving officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  The steering group secretary is a civil servant.  To date, the group has met on a total of 18 occasions.  As part of its work the group visited some FCA and Slua Muiri training exercises and camps and is scheduled to visit a further such exercise in December.  The steering group submitted an interim report on 30 July 1998 and the final report is due to be submitted early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 88, 97, 99, 106, 116, 128, 143 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of Price Waterhouse management consultants on the review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, the Government decided that the future development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service critically depends on the input of all of the relevant stakeholders. Given the cross-departmental nature of the State's air and sea requirements, key stakeholders include the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources as well as the Department of the Taoiseach and my own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> As Minister for Defence, I am responsible for the development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service and I will ensure that the civil and military branches of my Department do what the Government requires of them in putting together the necessary plans to give effect to the Government's decision on the recommendations made by Price Waterhouse.</P>
    <P>There are two broad dimensions to this work. First, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on Defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report.  Second, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible.  It will, in the final analysis, be the task of the General Office Commanding, Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding Naval Service to present plans for my consideration to address all of these matters.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have recently instructed the Chief of Staff to initiate, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, the necessary process to address these matters.  It is my aim to ensure that plans for the effectiveness and efficiency measures can be finalised early in the new year.  Detailed issues, including the future equipping of the Air Corps and the Naval Service and the location of the headquarters of both services, will be considered within these plans.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are participating in the consultation group which was set up to provide a forum for external stakeholders to make their input to the planning process with a view to ensuring that both services are meeting the needs of these clients.  The group is made up of senior civil and military officers, including the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service and is tasked with making relevant inputs to the planning process leading to the finalisation of implementation plans to give effect to the Government's decision as outlined already.  I am chairing this group which recently held its first meeting.</P>
    <P>The re-equipping and reorganisation of the Army has already been addressed under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-8, and its ongoing development will be addressed further in the White Paper process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> The report of the Expert Group on Hearing Disability Assessment, otherwise known as the Green Book, was published by the Department of Health and Children on 9 April 1998.  The Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998, which was subsequently passed by the Oireachtas, gave the Green Book a statutory basis, by requiring the courts to take notice of the Green Book and to have regard to the handicap assessment formula contained therein.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, the Green Book was subject to a test case Greene <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence and Others.  In the judgment on this case, Mr. Justice Lavan stated in relation to the Green Book and associated legislation that &ldquo;what is provided for here is a fair and reasonable method for assessing these litigants hearing disabilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, another judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Johnson, questioned the Green Book's treatment of the effect of age-related hearing loss and a second test case was required; Hanley <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence and Others which was heard in July last.  In this case, Mr. Justice Johnson also accepted the Green book &ldquo;as a fair and reasonable means of calculating disability&rdquo;.  However, he went on to say that &ldquo;the Green Book is not complete and there are some very serious gaps in it&rdquo; and, in his judgment, provided for a method of calculating the projected effect of current noise induced hearing loss with age-related hearing loss at age 62.</P>
    <P>The Green Book has been favourably received by leading international medical experts.  Because of the major policy implications and the need to ensure that the full range of national and international medical opinion is taken into account, these issues will be fully addressed again when the matter comes before the Supreme Court.  In this regard, I understand that the Supreme Court, in the recent judgment in Smith <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence, stated that prior to the passing of the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing) Act, 1998, there was no measurement system for hearing disability which the courts could regard as fair, just and reasonable between both parties in these cases.</P>

      <P>The representative associations for the Permanent Defence Forces, RACO and PDFORRA operate under a conciliation and arbitration scheme.

The C &amp; A scheme also provides a means for both sides to discuss issues which are of importance to them and to arrive at mutually acceptable resolutions.</P>
      <P>C &amp; A schemes have traditionally been adversarial in nature and did not lend themselves easily to the management of change.

New arrangements which will provide a more transparent and realistic system, in keeping with modern industrial relations thinking, will place greater emphasis on negotiation rather than adjudication to resolve issues.  These arrangements are, of course, consistent with the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness advocates building more open, co-operative processes on existing arrangements.  The terms of Partnership 2000 have recently been accepted by both associations. The provision of a forum to complement the C&amp; A structure and at which issues such as the implications of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces can be raised is under examination at present. Consideration is also being given to partnership structures for RACO and PDFORRA and I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of that process. In general, however, I believe that employment relationships can be very much improved by an acceptance by both sides that substantial support of each other is necessary to make progress. Both sides must also accept that each has a legitimate role and interest in the organisation. Such steps should lead to higher levels of mutual respect for, and trust in, each others positions.</P>

      <P>There are currently a total of 315 women in the Permanent Defence Forces which represents 2.8 per cent of the total strength.  Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Forces and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men.  All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 127 and 186 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances came within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO, and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Forces which was established in agreement with the associations.  Sub-committees of the conciliation council were established to <Col N="964" /> review, in the context of the PCW, the question of pay and allowances payable to the ranks represented by the representative associations.</P>
    <P>Following discussions at sub-committee, offers were made in both associations.  The main provisions of the package offered to RACO include: increases in basic pay; rationalisation of a number of pay scales and the introduction of long service increments for officers in the rank of lieutenant-colonel; a revised rate of £25 per day in respect of patrol duty allowance, and the introduction of an emergency medical officer allowance of £35 per day.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the package offered to PDFORRA include an increase of £15 a week in the rate of military service allowance; a revised rate of £25 per day in respect of patrol duty allowance, and a once-off payment to personnel involved in the BSE operation along the Border.</P>
    <P>In return both representative associations agree to a number of <i>quid pro quos,</i> including the acceptance of the national agreement Partnership 2000, a revised conciliation and arbitration scheme and the completion of discussions on the rationalisation of the duties attracting security duty allowance.</P>
    <P>I understand that these packages have been accepted by the membership of both associations. The sub-committees have yet to report to the conciliation council and the provisions will be implemented following formal agreement under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is hoped that, subject to the early signing of the agreements, payment will be made in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 140 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out regularly and frequently and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Other roles carried out by the Naval Service, generally in support of other Government Departments, include: search and rescue operations; aid to the civil power, drugs interdiction at sea; salmon fishery <Col N="969" /> patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  Six vessels are currently operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1977 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
    <P>As part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan, 1996-8, the Government established a steering group to review the operations of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  Price Waterhouse management consultants were appointed to carry out a detailed review of both services.  The report of the consultants was published in July 1998.  The military authorities have been asked to prepare an implementation plan to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>During my visit to United Nations headquarters in New York between 14 and 17 October 1998 I signed, on behalf of the Government, a memorandum of understanding which commits Ireland to the United Nations standby arrangements system, UNSAS, the purpose of which is to give the United Nations a precise understanding of the forces and other capabilities that Ireland would have available at a given state of readiness for a UN peacekeeping operation. Under the arrangements, Ireland has committed a maximum of 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time.</P>
      <P>I also had a number of meetings with top officials of the United Nations at which the future role and shape of UN peacekeeping operations were discussed.  The matter of alleged abuses of duty free privileges by members of the Permanent Defence Forces serving with the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, was also discussed.  I have since received a full official report on the matter from the United Nations.  The matter is being examined in my Department in consultation with the military authorities and any necessary action will be pursued in accordance with Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted that Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary General, United Nations accepted an invitation <Col N="970" /> to make an official visit to Ireland later in the year.  The Secretary General's acceptance of the Government's invitations to visit Ireland is a testament to the high esteem in which the Defence Forces are held in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations.  Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to tasks involving the prevention of illegal drugs importation.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the joint task force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in light of operational requirements. Eighty recruits were enlisted in the service in 1977, 72 to date this year and arrangements are in train for the enlistment of an additional 48 recruits.  Seventeen apprentices are also being recruited.  Twelve cadets are undergoing training with the Naval Service and in addition, nine watchkeeping officers have taken up appointment with the executive branch of the service.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  Six vessels are currently operational and one is undergoing refit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government considered my proposals for the preparation of the proposed White Paper on Defence in late July and approved the following objectives for the White Paper: to provide a medium-term policy framework within which defence policy can evolve to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide a framework to include the input of the Minister for Foreign Affairs deriving from the overall international security context and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard <Col N="972" /> to the national security environment; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme, already commenced under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, of defence services especially in relation to the future size, configuration, deployment and resourcing, financial, infrastructural and equipment, of the Defence Forces consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure the ongoing development of the management of defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative centrally, and, to provide a medium-term programme for the evolution of Civil Defence policy and as a follow-up to the present Towards 2000 strategy.</P>
      <P>The necessary work required by the Government's decision on the White Paper is proceeding. This is based on the work of my Department, civil and military, as well as appropriate inputs from other Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>In mid-August, notices were placed in all the national daily newspapers inviting submissions on any or all aspects of the White Paper from interested individuals and organisations, with a closing date of 16 October.  In cases where an individual or organisation has indicated to me that preparation of a submission is in hand, I am prepared to accept these up to mid-November. When all submissions received have been considered, arrangements will be made to meet key stakeholders, such as the Defence Forces representative associations.</P>
      <P>As this is the first White Paper of its kind, I have made it clear from the outset that adequate time should be provided for its preparation.  I wish to ensure all the issues raised are reflected upon adequately.  The timetable for this work is provisional but I would see the ongoing consultations being undertaken over the coming months with the intention of being in a position to put a draft for consideration by the Government by the summer of next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, important decisions in the defence area are proceeding in relation to, for example, barracks rationalisation, the ongoing reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the Air Corps and Naval Service reviews and the need to tackle the hearing loss compensation issue.</P>

The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  Revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996.  These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place.  This review will be undertaken in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The restructuring and reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Forces is proceeding in accordance with the recommendations of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan which was approved by Government in March 1996.  On 1 October 1998 Defence Forces headquarters was established in the Department of Defence and replaces the three military branches that had existed in the Department.  The Army component of the Permanent Defence Force was reorganised on 1 November 1998 and now comprises three Army brigades, a Defence Forces training centre, two logistics bases and some other elements such as the Army Equitation School.</P>
      <P>It is to be expected that the reorganisation of the Defence Forces will have some implications for the membership in the same way that restructuring and/or reorganisation in any organisation in the public or private sector has implications for the staff of such organisation.  However, in the Defence Forces every effort will be made to ensure a minimum number of personnel will be inconvenienced as little as possible by the ongoing reorganisation.  With regard to the deployment of personnel, it is envisaged that, as far as possible, all personnel will be facilitated to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Six military barracks were selected for closure which has resulted in units and personnel stationed in these barracks being relocated to the nearest barracks.  No further barrack closures are under consideration.</P>

Over the past three years works on modernising facilities at Collins Barracks, were completed at a cost of £3.1 million.  Projects to the value of £300,000 are ongoing.  Works undertaken in recent months to prepare accommodation for troops relocated from Murphy Barracks involved mainly electrical rewiring; installation of new windows; redecoration; and upgrading of heating systems.</P>
      <P>A special provision of £6 million will be included in the 1999 Defence Estimates as the first step towards the application of proceeds expected from the sale of barracks to the improvement of Defence Forces' infrastructure and to meet costs associated with the relocation of personnel.  It is anticipated that a number of new accommodation projects at Collins Barracks will be included.</P>

      <P>GDP is the value of goods and services produced.  It is measured by means of the income arising from the production of these goods and services, for example, profits, wages and salaries, etc.</P>
      <P>Regional accounts in Ireland are compiled by distributing the published State levels of GDP to the regions where the goods and services are produced. A range of statistical data relating to the different sectors of the economy which are available at regional level are used in this process. These include the annual census of industrial production, annual agricultural surveys, the quarterly national households survey, and periodic censuses of services.  Administrative data on public service incomes in the regions are also used in the process.</P>

      <P>The Shannon Estuary project team was established at the request of the Department of the Taoiseach and comprised representatives of the Departments of the Environment and Local Government; the Marine and Natural Resources and the Taoiseach; Foynes Harbour Trustees; the Industrial Development Authority; Limerick Harbour Commissioners; the University of Limerick and Shannon Development.  The team submitted its report in February 1994 and I am arranging for a copy to be provided to the Deputy.  The report set out planning principles and development strategies for the Shannon Estuary, and recommended a number of specific measures, not in order of priority, relating to a wide range of economic activities.  The report would afterwards have served as an input to the planning process of the various Departments and agencies involved in the area.</P>
      <P>More recently, Shannon Estuary Development Limited, SEDL, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shannon Development.  Its membership is comprised of representatives of the four local authorities in the area; the Foynes and Shannon Estuary port companies; IDA Ireland and Shannon Development which also chairs the company.  The company is working on a development strategy for the estuary to cover sectoral development, infrastructure development and port development.  A position paper on a strategic framework for the development of the lower Shannon Estuary will be completed by SEDL in the near future.  This will take account of previous studies of the development of the estuary.</P>

      <P>Assessment by insurance companies in respect of applicants for motor insurance is a matter for each individual insurance company based on its underwriting experience.  Insurers contend that, on the basis of their underwriting experience, drivers with certain disabilities are likely to be a greater risk than average and, in particular, when the disabled person is a learner or young, inexperienced driver.</P>
      <P>The subject of loadings applied to disabled drivers has been taken up by our Department on a number of occasions both with individual insurance companies and with the Irish Insurance Federation.  Following referral of the subject of disability loadings to the former Motor Insurance Advisory Board it was agreed that, provided the driver remained claims free, a maximum loading of 20 per cent disability loading would apply in the first year of insurance, this would decrease to 15 per cent in the second year of claims free insurance and no loading would apply thereafter provided the driver remained claims free.</P>
      <P>This arrangement is being operated by authorised motor insurers.  It does not apply, however, in the cases of degenerative illnesses and is subject to the insurers right to call for a medical examination.</P>
      <P>The present criteria used for assessing disabled drivers as an insurance risk is a considerable improvement on that which previously applied. Prior to the introduction of the current system, loadings ranged from 10 per cent to 150 per cent depending on the insurer in question and the nature of the disability.</P>
      <P>Our Department is not aware of any major problems concerning the current loading system. Nevertheless, the Irish Insurance Federation has agreed to look at individual cases where the foregoing arrangement has not been observed.</P>
      <P>The new Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I reconstituted on 3 September last, has also discussed the situation regarding disabled motorists and I understand it will be liaising with the Disabled Drivers' Association in due course on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question regarding the introduction of legislation to establish the insurance ombudsman on a statutory basis, I respectfully refer him to the detailed and comprehensive reply which I gave to the House on this issue on 3 November 1998.</P>

Some projects which commenced during this year will be due for completion in 1999. The Defence Estimates for 1999 will include a provision of about £15 million for building and engineering works generally and, in addition, a special provision of £6 million as the first step towards the application of proceeds expected from the sale of barracks to the improvement of Defence Forces' infrastructure and to meet costs associated with the re-location of personnel.</P>

      <P>The Kosovo verification mission was recently established by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  UN Security Council Resolution 1203 of 24 October 1998 welcomed the signing of the agreement between the OSCE Chairman in Office and the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to establish the OSCE Kosovo verification mission.</P>
      <P>Detailed plans are still being prepared by the OSCE in Vienna on all organisational aspects of the mission, including personnel requirements. Ireland is currently contributing expert personnel including one military officer who is serving with the OSCE in Vienna to the OSCE's special planning unit dedicated to this task.</P>
      <P>Ireland has indicated its readiness, in principle, to contribute to the verification mission.  In this connection the OSCE has a range of appointments in the planning/support unit which has been set up in Vienna which they wish to fill and my Department has been asked by the Department of Foreign Affairs to nominate personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces for selection for some of these specialist appointments.  The precise size and composition of Ireland's contribution will depend on the needs of the mission, which are currently being identified by the OSCE, as well as the availability of resources. The mission will be unarmed and of a civilian character.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given to the House by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 5 November 1998, in relation generally to the crisis in Kosovo as well as to the question of participation by the Defence Forces in the Kosovo verification mission.</P>

      <P>The person's REPS application includes commonage land and the revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for each commonage.  The preparation of the framework plan will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>

    <P>The new payment rates in REPS are as follows: £80 per acre for the first 100 acres; £8 per acre between 101 and 200 acres; and, £6 per acre between 201 and 300 acres.</P>
    <P>For the average existing REPS 80 acre farmer in a NHA, this will mean an increase in the annual payment from £4,960 to £6,400.  The maximum NHA payment increases from £6,200 per annum to £9,400.</P>

Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997 provided for a one year extension until 31 July 1998 where 15 per cent of the total expenditure was incurred before 31 July 1997.  Section 24 of the Finance Act 1998 extended the qualifying period for a further five months until 31 December 1998 subject to certain conditions.  One condition was that applicants had to show that they had problems completing projects before the end of the qualifying period due to delays which had arisen for bona fide reasons outside the direct control of the applicants concerned. I have received several representations requesting a further extension and the matter is being examined at present.</P>

      <P>The position is that since 1985 articles of children's personal clothing which do not exceed the sizes appropriate to children of average build of ten years of age, but excluding clothes which are not described, labelled, marked or marketed on the basis of age or size, are zero rate for VAT. <Col N="995" /> Articles of children's personal footwear of sizes which do not exceed the size appropriate to children of average foot size of ten years of age, but excluding footwear which is not described, labelled, marked or marketed on the basis of age or size, are zero rated for VAT.</P>
      <P>All other clothing and footwear attracts VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  The provisions of EU VAT law would rule out any extension in the scope of the zero rate at this stage.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the practical administration of these provisions is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who have at all times endeavoured to apply them in an equitable way and in full consultation and agreement with the clothing and footwear trade.  Explanatory leaflets detailing Revenue's administrative practices in this area are available on request.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that some children may require adult size clothing and footwear earlier than others.  However, any rule with a cut off point, such as this one, is likely to give rise to anomalous situations with both winners and losers.</P>

      <P>The supply of corrective spectacles is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  VAT on spectacles was introduced in 1989 following a ruling from the European Court of Justice.  Up until that judgment, Ireland and the UK were the only member states not applying VAT to the supply of spectacles.</P>
      <P>Irish VAT law must comply with the provisions of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  As such, member states may only retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but are prohibited from introducing new zero rates or applying a lower rate of VAT to an item not listed under Annex H of this directive.  Therefore, it is not now open to the Government to vary the VAT treatment in this case.</P>

Relief is granted to a company making a gift to &ldquo;designated schools&rdquo;, where the aggregate amount is between £250 and £10,000 to any one school, subject to an overall limit of £50,000 or 10 per cent of the company's profit where gifts are given to more than one designated school.  The relief is granted by treating the gift as a trading expense of the company for tax purposes.</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have provided a new computer code to process the relief to individuals. The first year in which individuals can claim the relief is the 1998-9 tax year.  Self-employed <Col N="997" /> individuals have not yet filed their tax return for the tax year 1998-9.  The due date for filing those returns is 31 January 2000.  Accordingly, there are no claims for the relief yet from self employed individuals.</P>
    <P>The position as regards PAYE taxpayers who have made a claim to have the relief included in their current certificate of tax free allowances is as follows: the total number of applications from PAYE individuals to date is three; the total amount of donations on which relief was claimed is £2,045.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that while the number of applications received and processed from PAYE workers has been low, it is anticipated that most claims for relief will be made in individual end of year tax returns.  It is expected that the figure will increase when the end of year reviews are carried out after the end of the 1998-99 tax year.</P>
    <P>The position as regards relief due to companies is the same as that for the self-employed individuals i.e. the returns from the companies in question have not yet been lodged.  Because of the nature of the relief for companies (a trading expense rather than a coded figure) it will prove difficult to extract these figures.</P>

      <P>Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. The processing of claims for individuals and families under the drug refund scheme is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board and health boards endeavour to process claims as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health boards that the processing of claims under the drug refund scheme generally takes between four and six weeks.  In the case of some health boards, however, the processing procedure may take longer, depending on the number of claims being submitted at any one time and the submission date of claims to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost to the health boards of reducing the time taken to process claims under this scheme.  I would point out to the Deputy, however, that there is a scheme available for people who incur on-going expenses on medicines whereby they do not have to await refund payments.  The drug cost subsidisation scheme was introduced to cater specifically for people who have a long-term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme pay £32 per month to <Col N="1000" /> their pharmacist in respect of all prescribed medicines dispensed during that month.  In order to qualify for this scheme, persons must be certified by a medical practitioner on all individual basis.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities in this matter and I have been advised that in common with other Dublin hospitals Beaumont Hospital is experiencing a general nursing shortage at present.  This has affected the level of nurse staffing in the operating theatres where currently there are 16 vacant posts.  As a consequence of the shortage of nurses in theatre, there are fewer nurses available for deployment to specialist areas such as neurosurgery. However, the hospital's management has pointed out that no specialist nurses have been moved from the neurosurgical theatres to work in any other areas.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that because of the nursing situation, it has been necessary to close one theatre in the hospital until the end of this year. However, I understand that the hospital's management has endeavoured to minimise disruption to patients and the hospital's chief executive officer has stated that it is the hospital's intention to ensure that patients who cannot be treated elsewhere and who require urgent surgery are not in any circumstances disenfranchised.  He has also indicated that the situation is being kept under constant review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that in response to current difficulties, the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA has established a task group to examine the full nature and extent of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action. While the task group has not yet completed its work, the HSEA has indicated to my Department that while a shortage of nurses exists it is not evenly distributed.  For instance, while there is not a nationwide shortage of nurses, nevertheless there is difficulty in recruiting specialist nurses required in ICU theatre, etc.  in many hospitals. According to the HSEA task group, there is, however, a general shortage of nurses in acute hospitals in the Dublin area, which are currently carrying some 450 vacancies.  There is also a difficulty in the recruitment of psychiatric nurses in the eastern and southern regions.</P>
      <P>The task group has identified a number of contributory factors and my Department is currently considering a number of specific short-term initiatives which have been put forward by the HSEA to address the shortage.  It is hoped to outline details of these initiatives to the nursing unions shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department issued Guidelines on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures in July 1996.

A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The guidelines relate primarily to the provision of new masts.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1997, the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast, and the replacement of an existing mast, are, subject to certain criteria &mdash; restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antenna and compliance with certain emission standards &mdash; exempted development. These regulations give statutory support to the policy of co-location which was advocated in the guidelines to avoid unnecessary proliferation of masts.</P>

      <P>In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property.  In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by a claimant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, any claimant, irrespective of age, whose sole means are derived from the assessment of board and lodging in the parental home and is entitled to less than £25 per week, has their unemployment assistance payment increased to £25.  This means, for instance, that where the combined net parental income does not exceed £19,698 per annum, a claimant is entitled to at least the minimum £25 weekly payment of unemployment assistance.  However, this measure only applies to claimants who have an underlying entitlement to an unemployment assistance payment.  in cases where the parental means are above the threshold, unemployment assistance is not payable.</P>
      <P>Any modification on the lines proposed by the Deputy would need to be examined in the context of a more general examination of current arrangements for assessing benefit and privilege.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of doubling the minimum unemployment assistance payment to £50 a week would be in the region of £0.4 million in a full year.  This proposal or any more general improvement in this regard would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to establish in present circumstances if there are people with an entitlement to pension who have not applied.  It is advisable for people to have their entitlement determined by my Department in any case where they have been gainfully occupied and where they are uncertain as to their position. Information leaflets and application forms for this purpose are widely available.</P>
      <P>Statistics as to the number of people who apply late for pension are not maintained on a systematic basis.  Under existing legislation where a claim is not made in time, payment can only be backdated for a specified period, the duration of which varies with the type of claim.</P>
      <P>The legislation in this matter has recently been significantly improved in the case of retirement, old age and widow or widower's contributory pensions.  Previously the general limit on back-dating of payments in these cases was six months. The limit was extended to 12 months in the 1997 Social Welfare Act.  This means that full arrears is payable from then for up to 12 months prior to the date of claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, under regulations I made in February last, a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid. The regulations provide for further arrears payments, <Col N="1007" /> in cases where claims are delayed due to <i>force majeure,</i> proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or to departmental error, and also to alleviate current financial hardship.  These improvements benefited a total of 180 late applicants for old age contributory pension whose claims were made in the period between January 1997 and February 1998.  Late applicants are continuing to benefit from these provisions on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In the context of a major upgrading of the pensions computer systems which is planned, it is proposed that provision will be included to identify and advise people with a potential qualification for contributory old age pension of their possible entitlement in advance of pension age. This facility will not, however, be available before the year 2000.  In the meantime every effort is being made, as part of my Department's Customer Action Plan, to ensure that people are made aware of the Department's schemes and that relevant information is available in an effective and accessible form.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The free schemes are also available to people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions.  In addition, widows or widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in <Col N="1008" /> receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the free schemes, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted categories who satisfy this condition. This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.  Dependent children) under the age of 18, or under the age of 22 if in full-time education, are excepted under this condition.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of that review.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Under the terms of these Acts, a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to their third level course.  Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>As the student in question was not 23 on 1 January of the year of entry to third level education he cannot be assessed as a mature student.  When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.  I understand that County Kildare VEC is awaiting further information to assess this student's application.</P>

      <Quest>the position on the provision of Information Technology 2000 in primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have established the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, to implement the various elements of Schools IT 2000.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann under the information age schools initiative, as a major partner in Schools IT 2000, has provided all schools with a multimedia computer and is currently providing each of them with an Internet connection.  A total of 4,200 computers has been provided under this initiative. Each school is acquiring free installation of a telephone line, free rental of the line for two years, and a number of hours free usage of the line per week for Internet access.</P>
      <P>In May of this year I announced the provision of £15 million in grant aid for the purchase of computers under the technology integration initiative of Schools IT 2000.  All schools, including primary schools, in the free education system received grants as follows: ordinary schools, a basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil; special schools, a basic grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
      <P>All ordinary schools with one or more special classes received an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.  I have also made provision for a special allocation of £250,000 to provide ICT hardware for individual children with special needs in mainstream classes at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that, in many cases, the grant provided by my Department has been added to significantly at local level by local groups, companies and businesses.  Taking all these into account I would estimate that there will be at least 15,000 additional computers in our schools, at primary and post-primary levels, by the end of 1998 and that even the smallest national school will have at least three computers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A current provision of £3 million has been made this year to provide support for Schools IT 2000 including the provision of training in the use of ICTs in education for teachers.  A programme of teacher professional development has already been put in place which has provided courses for at least 9,000 teachers to date, a very large number <Col N="1023" /> of these being primary teachers, as part of the teacher skills initiative.</P>
    <P>Under the schools support initiative, work is nearing completion on the development of ScoilNet, an outline support service, and all schools will be informed when it comes on line.  ScoilNet will also develop a countrywide network in association with the education centres.  ScoilNet will be an excellent resource as regards the provision of information, advice and support to all primary and second-level schools on Schools IT 2000 and on educational ICTs issues generally.</P>
    <P>The School Integration Project, SIP, which will promote whole school development in relation to ICT integration, is an essential element of Schools IT 2000 and will involve at least 40 schools, including a significant number of primary schools, initially.  The NCTE has developed a list of priority areas and detailed criteria for the evaluation of project proposals under the SIP.  These have been circulated to all schools with an invitation to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>A number of innovative ICT pilot projects involving private sector investment in IT 2000 are in place within the education system.  These projects are concerned with software-hardware development and applications and involve a growing number of primary and second-level schools.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities regarding third level grants is to ensure that students receive their first maintenance payment as early as possible in the academic year.  With this in mind, I brought the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities <Col N="1024" /> to a current year basis in 1997, which improved the timeliness of payments to students during 1997-8.  I am confident the local authorities will make every effort to make early payments to students again this year and, indeed, I understand that most local authorities have already paid the first of the three instalments of the maintenance grants.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved full-time undergraduate course, which must be pursued in an approved college in the Republic.  I understand that the student in question is attending the University of Ulster and I would point out to the Deputy that colleges-institutions in Northern Ireland are not included in the free fees initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as the Deputy may be aware, Irish students, along with all other EU students, including NI students, who commence courses in Northern Ireland in 1998-9, will be asked to contribute up to £1,000 per annum towards tuition fees for undergraduate courses.  However, all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance from the authorities towards their undergraduate tuition <Col N="1027" /> fees, subject to the same conditions including means testing as will be applied to Northern Ireland students.  Irish students must apply for assistance to their appropriate education and library board.  I would advise that the student in question contact the appropriate Northern Ireland education and library board in order to apply for grant assistance towards his tuition fees. In this regard, I understand that the means test arrangements are such that students who quality for maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme will generally qualify for grant assistance towards their tuition fees.  In this regard, I also understand that the student in question is in receipt of a maintenance grant under the higher education grant scheme from Monaghan County Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 to 320, inclusive, 322 and 323 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> Persons seeking provision for special needs children arising from the announcement in question, should make application to the special education section of my Department, which is based in Athlone.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is fully supportive of the measures in question and of the fact that the support referred to will be available to all children who have been assessed as requiring such support.  The introduction of this new demand-led scheme has been approved by Government.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of teachers in special schools and in special classes is not readily available. I have asked my officials to compile this information and I will arrange for it to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>At present, there are 104 resource teachers and 295 child care assistants dealing with children with special needs.  It is estimated that the equivalent of a further 90 to 100 resource teacher posts and 250 to 270 child care posts will be in place by this time next year.  The cost of these allocations in 1999 is estimated at approximately £4 million. The costs in subsequent years will be determined by the level of demand.</P>
    <P>Allocations arising from the announcement in question will not, as they are automatic entitlements, form part of the demographic dividend. The precise number of tuition or child care hours allocated in any particular case will depend on the specific assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
    <P>The figure of 18,000 children mentioned by the Deputy is comprised of approximately 8,000 children in integrated settings and 10,000 children in special schools or special classes.  Pupils attending special schools and special classes enjoy the pupil teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee in the case of eight of the 12 clinical groups identified by the committee.  Progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios for the remaining groups will continue in line with available resources.</P>
    <P>As far as child care support for these children is concerned, I fully recognised in the course of my announcement that many of these children were not receiving the support they require. Some children attending schools on a fully integrated basis, benefit from the support of the remedial, resource and visiting teacher services. However, as I indicated in the course of my announcement, many such children currently receive no support, either by way of tuition or child care assistance.  This is particularly the case in relation to individual or small groups of special needs children.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the measures which I have announced is to ensure that all children, whether in special schools, special classes or in integrated settings, will have access to the level of teacher and child care support which their assessed need require.
