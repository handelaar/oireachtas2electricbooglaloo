      <P>Could we have a debate on the Health Estimate for this year, in light of the fact which has emerged that wards are being closed while there is £32 million of unspent money in the hands of the Minister for Health?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order for me to ask the Taoiseach to allow a token Supplementary Estimate <Col N="1030" /> for the Department of Health to be debated in the House, so that we can debate the level of competence displayed by the Minister in allowing wards to be closed while he had £32 million of unspent money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking the Taoiseach to allow a debate later on this management failure in the health service, which involves waiting lists being increased and wards being closed while the Minister has money in hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that a debate on the Estimates is totally out of order on the Order of Business.  However, it is in order for the Opposition parties, who came together last night in a unique show of unity on an issue of importance, to ask the Taoiseach if he intends to make time available to debate an Estimate on Health between now and the end of the session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition is trying in an orderly manner to make a specific request for a debate on the Health Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not reply explicitly to that question.  He said if Supplementary Estimates are required, then they will be introduced.  That reply <Col N="1032" /> did not address the question posed which was &ldquo;will the Taoiseach make explicit time to debate a Supplementary Estimate on the question of the Health Vote?&rdquo; That requires a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

Deputy Bruton asked me to introduce a token Estimate.  I have no reason to do this.  The <Col N="1034" /> health issue has been discussed here on a number of occasions during Private Members' Business and the 1999 Estimates will be discussed the week after next.

      <P>I do not know if there will be a Supplementary Estimate but if there is, it can be debated in the House if the Opposition parties do not wish to debate it at the select committee. The figures mentioned have probably been taken from the memorandum issued by the Department of Finance yesterday.  To say there are balances is to misrepresent the position.  If further information is required, Members should table questions to the Minister for Finance.  The Estimates do not represent the final end of year position. Appropriations-in-Aid and other figures have to be taken into account.  I am not prepared to debate a token Estimate.  Any requests that the Opposition parties wish to make should be submitted through the Whips in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultants have said patients will die for lack of operations postponed or cancelled because of ward closures which are not confined to Galway or Tullamore.  I have no doubt there will be ward closures in other hospitals throughout the country.  The Minister for Health and Children has an extra £32 million, collected in health levies which were imposed on the PAYE sector specifically to provide health services, which is not being released to prevent ward closures.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children have accused the health boards of mismanagement.  Questions have to be asked about the Minister's management of his finances and his ability to foresee difficulties given that, on the one hand, wards are being closed and, on the other, money is available to prevent this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to provide extra money for health services as extra money is not required; rather there should be a token Supplementary Estimate to allow the Minister to explain what he will do with the £32 million.  I <Col N="1040" /> hope he will say he will allocate some of it to keep wards open and allow operations continue.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Taoiseach who is well qualified in health matters having worked in this area in his private life and as an accountant does not understand the situation where there are unspent balances which are available to prevent patients from being kept in queues, who are being prevented from seeing consultants and who are being allowed to face Christmas with the anxiety of pain and even death hanging over them.  They could have their pain relieved or their lives saved if the money was released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>What the House wants and what the Opposition parties are demanding is a debate on the contradiction whereby, on the one hand, there appears to be a sum of £32 million unspent and, on the other, there are ward closures because of lack of resources.  While I take the Taoiseach's point, if the figures available are correct, a Supplementary Estimate is not required to provide extra money.  This contradiction is incomprehensible to the public, especially those living in the catchment area of University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The Whips should meet before lunch to find a vehicle to enable us to have a focused debate on this ridiculous situation.  I detected in the Taoiseach's final remarks a willingness to allow the Whips to discuss the matter.  Time should be made available today or next week depending on the availability of the Minister who, with the Minister of State, was scalded in the House last night and who is probably still licking his wounds.</P>

      <P>It is important that we debate this issue.  It is even more important that the Government at its meeting next Tuesday makes a decision that the £32 million should be applied to opening wards and shortening queues so that patients who are facing what is in effect a death sentence can have some hope that they will survive.  Deputy McManus predicted some months ago that patients would die if steps were not taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Callely may not be aware that in the past year in my constituency a man in his forties who was two years on the waiting list died from a heart condition.  A four month old child also died for the want of an operation. This is not acceptable at a time when there is £1 billion lying in a bank unspent.  A decision is required that the money needed to provide a decent health service will be made available so <Col N="1041" /> that patients will not have to die to create a crisis and enough energy in the Government to make a decision to save lives.</P>

      <P>If there is a Supplementary Estimate, it can be debated in the House.  I have read the statement issued and seen the balances. As Deputy Bruton is well aware, whatever is available will be spent this year by the Department. The Deputy understands the process, as I do, well.  Appropriations-in-Aid and other figures have to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes this opportunity to debate the current situation in Central America.  We have all seen the harrowing images of the floods and mudslides which have engulfed lives and homes throughout Central America.  It is only right, therefore, that our concern, which reflects the anxieties of the Irish people and indeed all Members of this House, be voiced in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Tropical Storm Mitch, which during the first week of November reached hurricane strength, has devastated much of Central America.  In meteorological terms this is the fourth most powerful storm of the 20th century.  After battering the Atlantic coastline, it swept inland and reached Central America's Pacific coasts.  Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador took the brunt of the blow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over four million people are suffering the effects of the storm, many of them in isolated communities, some of which are still inaccessible to rescue teams.  Prolonged rain and winds of up to 300 kilometres per hour hit Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.  Almost all the <Col N="1050" /> roads connecting the Central American countries have been damaged while the capital cities, Tegucigalpa in Honduras and Managua in Nicaragua, are badly damaged.  The damage to infrastructure generally is complicating the relief effort.</P>
    <P>The impact of Hurricane Mitch on the economies of Central America has yet to be fully analysed.  Preliminary estimates of damage to key sectors such as agriculture, road networks and supply systems indicate that years of economic growth have been wiped out with inevitable consequences for the living standards of the affected nations.</P>
    <P>In Honduras, a week of relentless rain, floods and landslides had a very severe impact.  Over 7,000 people are reported dead, a further 11,000 are still missing while more than 2,000,000 people are affected.  According to the Honduran Government emergency committee, Hurricane Mitch was the most destructive natural phenomenon to hit Honduras this century.  Drinking water is not available, food is scarce and the supply of electricity is erratic.  Almost 600,000 people, 10 per cent of the population, are thought to have lost their homes.  The President of Honduras has declared that about 60 per cent of the infrastructure has been destroyed and the storm has been designated the worst natural disaster to hit Honduras in recent times.</P>
    <P>In Nicaragua, over 4,300 people are reported dead or missing.  Figures will become more accurate, and are likely to rise considerably as communications improve and access roads are cleared, since rescue teams continue to face difficulties in reaching many of the worst hit areas. The worst affected areas are west of the capital Managua, close to the border with Honduras.</P>
    <P>The single worst incident saw the collapse of the Casita Volcano which led to a massive mudslide.  Subsequently, a wall of mud up to three kilometres wide devastated an area of 80 square kilometres which included three towns.  The bulk of the country remains out of road communication with the capital, owing to the collapse of many bridges.</P>
    <P>The Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua have declared a national emergency and, together with Guatemala and El Salvador, have appealed for international assistance.</P>
    <P>The International Federation of the Red Cross has issued a preliminary appeal for international assistance, although they will update this appeal as needs increase.  In addition, national Red Cross societies throughout the region have mobilised up to 4,000 volunteers.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has activated its Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination Team which is currently in the region reporting to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs which is acting as a channel for immediate relief needs.  The UN Development Programme, UNICEF and the World Food Programme have contributed £335,000 and technical assistance from their own existing resources.  The UNDP and OCHA have announced the establishment of <Col N="1051" /> an inter-agency task force to focus on a comprehensive approach to humanitarian assistance.  As of 9 November, the total cash donations reported to the UN, including Ireland's assistance, totalled $41 million in cash grants along with large contributions of relief goods and technical assistance.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has approved a package of £5.4 million for Central American countries struck by Hurricane Mitch and will provide an additional £7.8 million in the coming week.  The aid, which the European Community Humanitarian Office will manage, will be disbursed in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador through NGOs and the Red Cross. The funding will cover food aid, temporary shelter, water purification products and medical inputs.  ECHO will continue to monitor the situation closely.  The European Commission has earmarked a further £10.2 million for rehabilitation work.</P>
    <P>At Monday's General Affairs Council, Commissioner Bonino announced her intention to travel to the region to review the situation.  In total, the European Union and its member states have donated more than $84 million to the emergency effort.</P>
    <P>The World Bank plans to advance a scheduled disbursement of approximately $20 million to support the Honduran Government's immediate needs for financial support.  In addition, it will immediately make available funds from a recently approved US $45 million loan for the Social Investment Fund Project to meet communities' needs for the emergency rehabilitation of basic infrastructure in rural areas affected by floods.  In total, the World Bank has announced it will make approximately £200 million available for immediate support to the countries affected.</P>
    <P>Ireland has responded quickly and generously by approving a total of £400,000 from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund administered by my Department.  While this funding is primarily focused on Honduras and Nicaragua, assistance to other affected countries in the region is also included.  Ireland's assistance is being disbursed through Trócaire, APSO, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the World Health Organisation.  Trócaire and APSO have spent many years carrying out excellent long-term development projects throughout the region.  These projects have now literally been swept away as the years of painstaking development were destroyed in one blow.  Staff have been redeployed in the short-term to maintain some level of essential services to the people.</P>
    <P>APSO, through its volunteers based in Honduras, is organising the supply of food, medicine and clothes for the jungle communities with which they work, although the logistical problems resulting from damage to the road network, and the poor communications, continue to hamper their efforts.  I understand an initial group of medical and logistics experts recruited from the rapid response register, established earlier this <Col N="1052" /> year by APSO with the support of my Department, has been dispatched to the region.  They will support its relief effort in the region.</P>
    <P>APSO continues its efforts to supply isolated communities with food, clothing and medicines. It has distributed 15 tons of food and medicines to communities on the North Coast and the Mosquito Jungle.  Further shipments are being prepared. The Department is keeping in close touch with APSO which has reported the urgent need for fast growing rice and bean seed in the hope of producing some food within the next three months.  As Honduras is about to enter the dry season there are but a few areas where it is feasible to plant at this late stage.  For the rest of the country, which has lost between 70 and 90 per cent of this year's harvest depending on the area affected, food distribution will have to continue for the next nine months until the 1999 harvest starts to come on the market.  To avoid duplication, APSO is co-ordinating closely with other international agencies, particularly Trócaire.  I have approved grants totalling £80,000 to APSO following their request for assistance in both Honduras and Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Ireland's assistance to Honduras and the solidarity of the Irish people with the stricken country has been acknowledged by the Honduran Minister for International Relations.</P>
    <P>Trócaire's personnel in Honduras, both expatriate and local, have extensive experience of handling emergency relief programmes, most recently in conjunction with Irish Aid for emergency relief for El Nino drought victims.  Trócaire has a network of local counterpart organisations in the affected areas which allows it to operate at short notice in emergency situations.  Trócaire has identified 17 projects directly affected by the hurricane in nine municipalities in Honduras.  Grants totalling £100,000 have been allocated to Trócaire's initial programmes aimed at providing emergency assistance.  The main form of relief supplies will consist of family food packages.</P>
    <P>According to recent reports from the World Health Organisation, one of the most immediate threats is one of disease as a result of severe damage to the health infrastructure and an acute shortage of medical supplies.  The needs are great in view of injuries requiring emergency care, and high risks from epidemics of cholera, malaria and dengue fever in stricken areas.  Respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis are reported by public health authorities in all the countries affected.  A grant of £100,000 will go towards meeting these needs.  It will be disbursed <i>via</i> the UN office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and earmarked for the World Health Organisation Appeal for emergency medical supplies on behalf of all countries affected.  Part of the moneys allocated to APSO will fund the supply of emergency medical kits in some of the most affected areas of Honduras.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government has approved grants totalling £100,000 to Trócaire for immediate relief effort, which include meeting the needs <Col N="1053" /> in nine severely affected municipalities in Honduras to assist approximately 30,000 people; grants totalling £80,000 to APSO for humanitarian assistance in Honduras and Nicaragua; a grant of £120,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross &mdash; the federation, along with its national societies, is able to disburse these funds to where they are most needed including other countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador; and a grant of £100,000 to the World Health Organisation for emergency medical supplies on behalf of all countries affected within the region.</P>
    <P>In allocating this bilateral emergency funding, I have taken into account the very clear needs in Central America.  The current storm is one of a number of disasters which have happened across the world in recent months.  Floods in Bangladesh, India and China have also affected millions of people.  Ongoing emergencies in Sudan, Central Africa and Kosovo, to name just a few, require humanitarian assistance.  Ireland has given generously to all these areas and will continue to be as responsive as we can, given our capacities.</P>
    <P>The capacity to pay of the heavily indebted countries affected by the hurricane has, to put it mildly, become extremely limited, if not virtually non-existent.  This requires an urgent international response including the possibility of a debt moratorium on immediate debt payments and addressing long-term debt needs.  It is very encouraging to see that some countries are moving to cancel the debt owed to them by the worst affected countries, which are genuinely on a debt treadmill.  Servicing external debt diverts scarce resources from vital areas like health and education, and supporting debt relief is now a key pillar in our aid strategy.  We have already taken practical steps to support debt initiatives by allocating a total of £20 million towards debt relief through direct allocations to debt relief funds and for the first time through the World Bank and IMF programmes which are geared to ease the plight of the most highly indebted countries.  It makes sense for us to do this.  Quite simply, by spending less on debt repayment these countries can spend more on their own people and on social and human development.  Nowhere is this more patently clear than in the Central American countries affected by Hurricane Mitch.  These countries have to start again from zero.  Their chances of rehabilitation will be severely hampered if they are burdened by unsustainable debt levels.  With this in mind the General Affairs Council of the European Union held an initial discussion on this matter last Monday, and it will also be discussed by other Ministers with responsibility for development at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>This was a natural disaster of massive and deadly proportions.  It was also a disaster which had a savage and disproportionate impact on a region which was already struggling to cope with the every day needs of its people.  This was a double cruelty.  Richer countries can be prepared for <Col N="1054" /> storms and hurricanes.  Buildings are more secure, technology permits minute by minute information, there are resources to permit large scale evacuation and people have insurance and jobs to return to.  By contrast we have seen in Central America how poverty compounds the impact of disaster leaving a deadly legacy.  They were not prepared, there was no warning and in the aftermath poor telecommunications, lack of basic equipment, poor housing and adequate medical services means that more will suffer and rebuilding will take longer.</P>
    <P>For Nicaragua, the disaster comes at a particularly unfortunate time, after a period of drought which damaged agricultural production.  Despite that drought, recent growth forecasts had been promising, but the effects of the hurricane and flooding on the livelihoods of farmers and on agricultural production are likely to be very severe with some reports suggesting that 80 per cent of the valuable coffee crop has been lost.  There may also be a reversal of progress achieved under the second enhanced structural adjustment facility agreed with the IMF last March.  A recent agreement between the government, doctors and other public health workers for badly needed salary increases of over 100 per cent could also be jeopardised if funds have to be diverted by the government in emergency relief and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In Honduras the widespread destruction of factories, farmland and crops means that many of the survivors have lost their only source of income.  One of the industries hardest hit has been the banana industry, which in some areas has been totally devastated and may take years to recover.  The hurricane and subsequent water and mud slides have in some places not only destroyed the crop but also rendered the ground unusable for probably many years for banana production.  Thousands have lost their jobs and their livelihoods.  The international community must come to their aid.  I applaud the decisions of some of the international companies doing business in the areas, like Fyffes, who have made donations towards relief and are committed to rehabilitating the land and the industry which has been affected.</P>
    <P>Peace was also returning, with the most recent of several peace agreements being signed between rebels and the government in Guatemala.  The Guatemalan peace accords, which were recently approved by the country's Congress, involve the achievement of socioeconomic targets and it remains to be seen to what extent the disaster may jeopardise these commitments.</P>
    <P>Environmental degradation has aggravated the effects of such disasters.  Widespread deforestation leading to silted riverbeds, construction in flood plains and on the flanks of mountains, the use of slash and burn techniques for clearing land &mdash; all of these combine to increase the scale of devastation when natural catastrophes occur.  The devastation caused by mudslides in Honduras is <Col N="1055" /> ample evidence of this.  Honduras and Nicaragua were poor countries and have now been set back by many years.  Decades of work was eliminated in a period of 24 hours.  The tireless and heroic efforts of our aid workers had to switch from building up employment and community programmes to emergency relief.</P>
    <P>While we concentrate our immediate attention on emergency relief efforts it is clear that the international community must show long-term commitment and solidarity with the countries of Central America in their efforts to rebuild their economy and renew hope for their people.  One community leader in Honduras was quoted as saying &ldquo;we are not on our knees begging, we are asking for the dignity of your co-operation&rdquo;.  We owe them that dignity.</P>
    <P>Long after the television cameras have left the scenes of devastation we must maintain our presence and work in the region.  We will need to focus on long-term rehabilitation assistance and I have given a commitment that the Irish Government will, together with the international community, stay with these countries and help increase their capacity to grow out of poverty.</P>
    <P>The EU is already looking at ways to support urgent reconstruction.  The Council regulation on assistance to developing countries in Asia and Latin America already provides for additional funding and technical assistance for reconstruction in the wake of disasters.  Ireland will be pressing for full use of this facility.  In addition, the disaster in Central America will be a principal item on the Development Council agenda when it meets at the end of this month.  I will strongly support programmes for emergency aid and reconstruction to assist the devastated countries.</P>
    <P>Although some people may wish the Government to respond even more generously to the needs of Central America, my ability to do so is limited by the resources available for official development assistance.  It is true that ODA has increased every year since 1992 from a low base of £40 million to £137 million this year, a huge increase of 242.5 per cent.  This is a growth rate which has reflected successive Governments' commitment to the developing world.  There is strong democratic support for this.  We are now a developed nation thanks to our own efforts and huge transfers from the EU.</P>
    <P>Between the late 1970s and early 1990s, EU transfers to Ireland accounted for between 2 and 4 per cent of our GDP.  No poor country has benefited from the generosity of others on such a scale.  In the period from 1992 to 1997, the aid allocation as a percentage of GNP rose from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent in line with the commitment to move towards the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP.  However, the extraordinary growth in GNP has complicated matters and has in effect overtaken our aid commitment as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>For example, an extra allocation of £15 million was agreed for 1998 as part of the Estimates process <Col N="1056" /> at the end of 1997 aimed at the time of its allocation at reaching a target of 0.32 per cent of GNP.  However, the rapid GNP growth in the year has meant the outturn is more likely to be around 0.29 per cent.  To deal with this dilemma of growth as it impacts on ODA percentage GNP targets, we need to agree multi-annual budgets to avoid the annual round of adversarial Estimates discussions.  This is a matter not just for the Government but for parties opposite who, in due course, will be on this side.  In light of that, it is all the more important that we hold firm to the trend of the last few years of sustaining incremental increases so that at least, in real cash terms, the budget grows every year to maintain a credible aid programme.</P>
    <P>Our aid budget is a measure of our commitment to civilised values.  There is perhaps no greater practical indicator of our solidarity with the poor of the world and the vindication of human rights than our work in developing countries. The Estimates for 1999 have now been published. Because the overall increase is inadequate and because large mandatory payments are due in 1999 we are forced to cut back on country programmes, emergency and humanitarian assistance. Deputies know my views on this: I am appalled.  The debt package, while welcome and legitimately an allocation under ODA, sits oddly with a cut in spending on basic needs and emergency assistance.</P>
    <P>I hope in the context of a caring budget, the Government will address the concerns I expressed last week and again today in this regard.  Times are good in Ireland and it is imperative that we share our bounty with those people whose poverty has no parallel here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate but I wish we had a more rapid response in terms of parliamentary opportunity to discuss issues of this kind.  We should have discussed this matter last week.  Two weeks after Hurricane Mitch hit these poor under-developed countries, particularly Nicaragua and Honduras, we are only starting to swing into action.  While I welcome the rapid response unit of APSO, I urge the Minister to examine the feasibility of setting up an emergency rapid response unit on a broader basis which would be ready to travel to accident locations within 24 hours.  The unit should consist of key rescue and medical personnel, logistics personnel who would assess the needs on the ground, emergency shelter units &mdash; which would have tents available to it, food rations, water purification tablets, water containers, medical supplies and communications equipment.  Ireland, which 150 years ago lost one quarter of its population because of a famine, could make a significant contribution by having that rapid response unit ready.  As a State, our official response is to react after the event and not have a proactive response unit in place with general parameters along the lines suggested.  APSO is trying to <Col N="1057" /> respond quickly but it needs to be more broadly based.</P>
      <P>In her contribution the Minister of State referred to grants approved by the Government of £100,000 to Trocaire, £80,000 to APSO, £120,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and £100,000 to the World Health Organisation for emergency use in those areas, a total of £400,000.  In the context of the £1.5 billion a year approximately which we receive from the EU to help us catch up with our EU neighbours, the £400,000 being allocated to this disaster &mdash; probably the greatest disaster in living memory from one disaster &mdash; is meagre.  We do not yet know how many people are dead.  The number could be upwards of 7,000 and according to some estimates it could be as high as 18,000.  Against that figure, the financial contribution we have made so far is meagre.</P>
      <P>In her contribution the Minister of State mentioned the requirement for an urgent international response including the possibility of a debt moratorium on immediate debt payments and addressing long-term debt needs.  I urge the Minister to take the initiative in this matter and to seek the appointment of an independent commissioner for debt who would look at the capacity of these debtor countries to make their repayments. One cannot forgive all debts because the governments of some of those states have sequestered these funds for their own use.  An independent commissioner for debt could look at the case for forgiving debt entirely on the basis of merit for debtor countries.  If this cannot be done on an international basis, let us try to do it among the EU states so that the EU states, including Ireland, could forgive whatever debt may be due to us.  The Minister commends France and Spain which are moving to cancel the debt owed to them by the worst affected countries.  When replying perhaps the Minister of State would outline the level of international indebtedness, if any, to Ireland and what steps are being taken to encourage our neighbours in the EU to forgive whatever debt exists.</P>
      <P>In the latter part of her contribution the Minister of State set out the money contributions received and referred to the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP, set by the previous Government towards achieving 0.7 per cent set by the UN.  It is clear we will not meet the target set unless the Minister or this House deals with the situation once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, one of a small number of Ministers in the minority partner in this Coalition, has more leverage to do this than she realises.  It is not good enough for a Minister to make a speech as if she were in Opposition, unless she is prepared to deliver on that.  I urge the Minister to bring in legislation to bind the Government and future Governments not only to the 0.45 per cent of GNP but to make it an interim commitment by legislative deed of this House and proceed to make provision by legislation to meet the 0.7 per cent target.  If that is <Col N="1058" /> the case, these contributions will have to be met out of the Central Fund without further recourse to this House on an annual basis.  Every future Government would be bound to meet that legal requirement whether the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance agrees.  I urge the Minister to draft such a Bill and put it before the House.</P>
    <P>I pledge to vote for it if she does so.  She should make it a legislative requirement so there will be no future fudging on this issue.  The will of this House is there to provide those funds and it should give legislative effect to that will.  We should take it away from the annual Estimates debacle which puts it in competition with roads and everything else required.</P>
    <P>We are doing extraordinarily well and before we forget ourselves, it is time we realised from where we came and our obligation to share what we have with those who are least privileged.  A woman contacted my office the other day and attacked me for standing up in this House and seeking to have more funds committed to overseas development aid because of other requirements which need to be met at home.  We have an Exchequer budget surplus of in excess of £1 billion this year.  However, whether or not we have such a surplus, we have an obligation to help the least privileged on this planet.  If we do not do so, we are sowing the seeds of our own future destruction because we are allowing for future turmoil which will find its way to our doorstep.</P>
    <P>I was upbraided by a lady during the last general election who said she had not seen the Celtic tiger around her area.  I asked her to take a look down the road &mdash; this partly comfortable part of Dublin has since been transferred from my constituency so I can probably tell the story with greater ease &mdash; where every house had at least one or two cars in the driveway, a telephone line going into it, carpets on the floor, coloured televisions and central heating and where there was the opportunity for children in that part of Dublin to be educated to second and third level as a matter of norm.  She said in a civilised way that the ladies in the golf club to whom she had spoken the other night would not agree with me.  I replied &mdash; I do not know whether she has forgiven me yet &mdash; that I doubted very much if her mother had central heating, a telephone, a coloured television, carpets on the floor, cars in the driveway, the opportunity for her children which she had for hers and that she certainly did not have the opportunity to go to the golf club to complain about it.  It is time we reminded ourselves of that.</P>
    <P>Large numbers of people are starving, just as our people starved some generations ago, and we have a duty and an obligation to them.  The number of cars in the driveway is not a measure of our success but how we use our commitment, as the Minister said, in budgetary terms and our time and possessions in committing to civilised values.  It is a civilised value to try to assist people in situations in which those in Nicaragua and <Col N="1059" /> Honduras find themselves.  If we leave anything to our children, it should not be the car in the driveway but these values.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take what I said on board.  I vow here and now to co-operate with her.  She must introduce legislation, place this on a statutory basis and commit us to sharing that slice of the cake so that there will be no future need for Ministers to come into the House to threaten to resign or otherwise.  I hope the Minister continues to rock the boat and that she makes it clear she will resign if the targets in percentage terms are not met.</P>
    <P>I refer to press reports of the extent of the problem in Honduras and Nicaragua, in particular to an AFP report quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 November which gives a sense of the extent of the problem.  It states:</P>
    <P>With an average of 48 hectares (118 acres) of forest lost every hour in the region, they say many mountainsides no longer have trees to hold back landslides or stop the rain from sweeping away topsoil and dumping it in rivers.  . .</P>
    <P>Torrential rains drenched the region for a week, flooding rivers, which swept away hundreds of kilometres of rail tracks and roads, entire villages and thousands of hectares of crops.</P>
    <P>They also caused massive landslides, including one on the south flank of the Casitas volcano in north-eastern Nicaragua that buried five villages and killed more than 2,200 people. The total death toll has been estimated at 11,100 with 15,300 still missing across Central America.  . .</P>
    <P>At the best of times, between 80,000 and 108,000 hectares (200,000 and 270,000) acres of tropical forests disappear every year in Honduras.</P>
    <P>In neighbouring Nicaragua the figure is between 100,000 and 120,000 hectares, according to environmental organisations.</P>
    <P>In both countries, deforestation is mainly carried out by multinational companies, including banana producers and timber industries.</P>
    <P>And, with the best land held by multinationals and wealthy farmers, many in this impoverished region chop down trees on the flanks of mountains and volcanoes to cultivate a small parcel of land.  When the soil no longer produces enough, they move a little higher chopping down a few more trees to grow the corn and beans they need to feed their families.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The case of Casitas was foreseeable.  Poor peasants deforested its flanks without respecting any rule or taking into consideration the fragility of the soil and the slopes.  Unknowingly, they dug their own graves&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report could be no more factual than that in that they unknowingly literally dug their own graves.  The report also stated:</P>
    <P>The practice of burning forested areas to clear <Col N="1060" /> land for cultivation also contributes to deforestation, as does the widespread use of wood for cooking fuel in the region where only a minority has access to electricity.  In Honduras, 59 per cent of city residents and 95 per cent of those who live in the countryside cook on wood fires</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we continue to cut down our forests at this rhythm, we will not have a single tree left by 2020,&rdquo; said one Nicaraguan conservationist.</P>
    <P>The above all indicates that we need more than this meagre response.  We need to proactively help those people not to dig their graves and the way to do so is to ensure we meet the full UN target of 0.7 per cent and to put it on a statutory basis.  More than any other Minister before her, this Minister has the power and leverage to do so and I pledge to support her if she does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked for this item to be discussed last week I thought about the circumstances in which it would be discussed.  There are some advantages to discussing it this week because we have had an opportunity to reflect for one week on the international, European and Irish responses.  We are, therefore, able to assess the adequacy of our response in terms of the problem.</P>
      <P>I have some familiarity with this region.  I went to Nicaragua for the first time in 1981 and during the 1980s visited Central America on maybe more than half a dozen occasions.  It would be useful if our response was structured in such a way as to have the most meaningful medium and long-term impact as well as a short-term one. Taking up a point raised by the previous Deputy, we need to open our eyes clearly to the background of the ecological disaster.  The Central American region faced one of its most significant invasions in the 1950s when President Arbenz was elected in Guatemala.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the country was invaded because of his stated election promise that he would call into question the fact that the Grace Corporation had 48 per cent of the total land area of Guatemala at that time and had promises of further leases, which would deprive peasants of their land.  It led to the migration of the Grace Corporation to Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>The Grace Corporation and other multi-national corporations pushed the peasants in the direction of the forests.  It was not a question of the peasants not knowing what they were doing, but of them being consciously pushed by multi-national corporations towards the most vulnerable areas of their ecosystem.</P>
      <P>Today, the same multinational corporations, with other multinationals, are now claiming intellectual property rights on the botanical diversity of the forests, having found out they are of immense benefit to the pharmacological industry. Therefore, a vicious international corporate capital always had a lien on this region, which weighed heavily on the minds of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Nicaragua in the 1980s.  A war of economic <Col N="1061" /> attrition, as well as a military war, was taking place and there was a conscious destabilisation of the elected Government of Nicaragua.  I do not intend to dwell on that, but simply to say the cost of the war in one year in the 1980s was $238 million.  We can compare our £400,000 with that figure.  When an Irish parliamentary delegation visited Nicaragua they saw holes in the walls from where shells had been fired, not just in the officially declared war but also in the dirty war, in which people such as Colonel North participated.</P>
    <P>The West has an incredibly negative relationship with this region, which is countered to some extent by the extraordinary contribution of those in NGOs and the voluntary sector.  I want to be as practical and positive as I can.  There is an immense benefit to the Minister of State and her State in channelling as much aid as possible directly to the region on a people to people basis. For example, Sally O'Neill Sanchez, who has been a senior executive with Trócaire for most of her life, is in an excellent position to give direct evidence of the projects which are necessary in Honduras.  It would be best to send the aid as quickly as possible to the people in order to save on administrative costs.</P>
    <P>I am not making a party political point, but it is little less than tragic that APSO's budget is effectively being cut in the Estimates.  In the reconstruction of Nicaragua, for example, while building materials were necessary, the skills of carpenters and others with construction skills were even more necessary to address the housing shortage.  Members may not know that the eastern coast of Nicaragua, much of which is non-Spanish speaking, always had communications difficulties.  The only access was by air, which made it necessary to have helicopters which could respond quickly to the east coast.</P>
    <P>Honduras has taken the biggest brunt of what has happened and needs technical aids.  For example, it is being reported in the international press that the thousands of lost bodies in the lake in the centre of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, are raising a stench.  There is the possibility of disease and detailed and expert assistance is required to address that immediately.  There are also many difficulties in relation to Lake Managua.</P>
    <P>We need to construct an adequate response, and not just in terms of the volume of money. The sum of £400,000 would not buy one of the houses written about in the Thursday property supplements of Irish newspapers.  We must make a significant response.  If the APSO budget were doubled and the technical skills were released into the area immediately, the issue of housing, shelter and so on would be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is an immediate need to supply beans and rice.  The destruction of the coffee crop will impact enormously on the economies of the region.  It will probably have a less disseminated effect than the banana failure.  However, more <Col N="1062" /> importantly, the food security of the ordinary population will require beans and rice.</P>
    <P>There is no point in speaking about restructuring the debt or having a moratorium on interest payments as there is no capacity to pay.  However, something even more immoral happened in Nicaragua. When the Government of Daniel Ortega Saavedra, of the Frente Sandista de Liberación Nacional, was elected in Nicaragua, it had to secure international recognition to undertake the Somoza debt.  A huge portion of the Nicaraguan debt was acquired, squandered and used for oppression by the Somoza family.  The IMF's strategy, which was imposed on Nicaragua shortly after the accession of La Dona Violeta Chamorra, the then President of Nicaragua, was one which required the destruction of the public sector, put children selling matches on the streets of Managua and reversed a series of significant gains in relation to public education and literacy.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate time for us to look at how international financial agencies impact on that region and to wipe out the debt.  An interesting fact is that Cuba, a country with many difficulties and which suffers from an immoral and internationally illegal blockade, has written off £36 million in debt owed by Nicaragua.  We must make a strong case for the cancellation of the Central American debt.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we could have anticipated some of the difficulties created by the economic policy. For example, in 1982, Nicaragua suffered a $356 million loss to its economy from flooding.  An adequate response must be made to the crisis immediately, in terms of food security and immediate shelter, and the money must be got to those working on the ground.  There must also be a medium term strategy which leaves construction, communication and planning skills in place. In the long-term there must be an entirely new approach and a radical critique of the consequences of the IMF and international lending agencies' prescriptions for the Central American region, particularly the countries most affected.</P>
    <P>The Honduras debt to the European Union is approximately $1.8 billion.  Anyone who suggests Honduras has the capacity to pay that is not just not living in the real world but is subscribing to an economics of cruelty.  When I was in Central America in the 1980s it was not unusual for 45 cents in every dollar to go on servicing the debt. At the same time, there was malnutrition and an absence of safe housing and safe water.  We cannot continue to say to people that about half of their limited production capacity must go on servicing their debt.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to co-ordinate the European Union response.  The French response that the debt should be eliminated is welcome.  The British response that there should be a moratorium or a rescheduling of the debt is disgraceful.  Holland and Spain have said they will think out the position but they are likely to favour cancellation.</P>
    <P>I will give an indication of who made money during the good days of Somoza.  Some 3,500 US <Col N="1063" /> banks lent money to the Central American region when there was a return to be made.  One of the reasons the debt could not be cancelled was the argument of the Federal Reserve about the impact on those 3,500 banks and the possible European response if the Americans took a particular line.  It is time to test whether there is a genuine autonomous European Union foreign policy, inclusive of overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>I want to encourage the Minister of State.  I appreciate how difficult it was for her to say she was appalled at the cut in ODA and I agree with her.  This matter also arose when my party was a partner in Government with the Fianna Fáil Party and we left Government in 1994.  The attitude of the Department of Finance was extraordinary.  It mediated through the Department of Foreign Affairs that there should be a cut in ODA.  It is damaging its credibility in relation to its commitment to an economics that is inclusive of people.</P>
    <P>The reality is there is widespread public support for paying the proportion and percentage of GNP in respect of ODA.  The Department needs to get that message and the Minister of State was right to say what she said.  The position was similar to where one is doing well and one says one never thought one would do that well and, therefore, one can shift the percentage.  That is disgraceful. As the previous Deputy said, there is a consensus in the House on this.  We will take whatever flak there is.  I do not see why we should have to make a comparison between the poor at home and the desperate abroad.  The reality is there is all-party support for meeting our commitment in this regard.  It has taken a terrible disaster like this for us to rise to affirm our commitment to continue to move towards meeting the UN target for ODA.</P>
    <P>I went initially to Central America at the invitation of Trócaire.  Other organisations are also working there.  All those voluntary organisations, APSO and others are doing great work.  People should realise the enormous impact access to clean water or the security of grain or rice has on a village.  The last time I was there was the end of the 1980s when school books were withdrawn from the children and a standard school text was issued.  The same standard text was issued in Honduras and Guatemala which dealt with the westernisation of Nicaraguan, Honduran and Guatemalan children.  All the work of Fernando Cardenan and his brother Ernesto and others was practically wiped out overnight.  The international marketplace at the end of the 1980s was used to destroy the literacy and education of children, the prospects of people in the cities and to wind up projects in remote areas.  This national disaster has compounded the political attitude.</P>
    <P>We are being tested by having to say if we are willing to meet our commitment to overseas aid. This week has not been lost.  We have seen what everyone else is doing and our contribution of £400,000 is only peanuts.  We need to increase it. We need to make short-term, medium-term and <Col N="1064" /> long-term responses.  I urge that we learn from this.  When we participate in consultations on world trade and so on we must examine what is the latest robbery in terms of bio-diversity and the botanical diversity.  If multinational corporations did what it is said they did, it is up to people of goodwill to respond generously.  If the Minister pushes this matter, she will have my support. It is important she should do that and she would not be doing it for herself.  There is consensus in the House that we should make the response I have talked about.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this short debate to express our solidarity with the people of Central America, especially those in Honduras and Nicaragua who have suffered so terribly as a result of the devastation inflicted on them by Hurricane Mitch two weeks ago.  What we are dealing with here is not only the aftermath of another tropical storm, but the aftermath of one of the worst weather related disasters of the 20th century.  The US Weather Centre has declared Hurricane Mitch the worst Atlantic storm since the great hurricane of 1780. It is also clear that the scale of the aid and assistance required from the developed world is much more than the normal sticking plaster response to Third World disasters.</P>
      <P>There is some evidence that the developed countries are responding in an unprecedented way and there is some hope that some long-term good may yet come out of this terrible disaster in that the West is beginning to look seriously at questions like the restructuring or writing off debt.  However, the initial response of our Government was so meagre as to be embarrassing. As many speakers pointed out, £200,000 would barely buy a semi-detatched house in Dublin. It would not cover the cost of building two local authority houses.  Even the additional £200,000 announced this week is still far short of the level of aid we should be able to provide, given the exceptionally strong performance of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had not seen some of the scenes of the devastation so graphically and vividly depicted on our television screens, the scale of the disaster would be hard for us to comprehend.  Fifty inches of rain fell in the storm within five days.  Two weeks later, nobody knows for certain how many people have died.  Estimates are changing each day as more areas are opened up and more bodies are found.  The latest estimate I saw suggests that up to 17,000 people may have died, the great bulk of these in Honduras and Nicaragua.  The power of television has been important in informing people across the globe as to the extent of the destruction.  Before I came into the House today I had a telephone call from a woman working in the home and feeding her young children. She decided to organise a fundraising event in her kitchen because she was so appalled and distressed at the sights she saw on television.  That <Col N="1065" /> community spirit needs to be reflected in the Government's response to this disaster.</P>
    <P>As a result of this disaster, tens of thousands of people are homeless, infrastructure has been destroyed and crops have been laid waste.  On the Casitas volcano in northwest Nicaragua the torrential rain unleashed a mudslide which wiped out two towns and several villages that were home to around 4,000 people, most of whom are believed to be dead.</P>
    <P>Honduras, which suffered most, will require homes for 1.4 million people, about a quarter of its population.  Nicaragua will require homes for about a million, or 20 per cent of its population. In Honduras alone, 89 of the country's bridges have been destroyed and around three-quarters of its crops destroyed.  In Nicaragua, the Government estimates that it will take more than $1 billion to rebuild 1,500 miles of road, 80 bridges, 300 schools and dozens of health clinics and public buildings.</P>
    <P>Central America is already a poor region.  Honduras, which bore the brunt of the storm, is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with 82 per cent of the population living below the poverty line.  It has an unemployment rate of 45 per cent.  It will take decades for the region to recover from this disaster.  Inadequate housing was demolished, the road system was washed away, communications were disrupted and food reserves and crops have been destroyed.  Famine is now a real danger.  The region needs short-term assistance but it also needs long-term aid and assistance.</P>
    <P>In the short-term the priority must be to rescue people who are still stranded by the flooding and to provide for their immediate needs in terms of medicine, food, clothing and shelter.  A principal problem in this regard is communications, given that so many bridges have been destroyed and so much of the basic infrastructure has been washed away.  Planes and helicopters are urgently required.  Military task forces have been put together before within a matter of days when there was a danger of conflict in different parts of the world.  A similar sense of urgency is required on the part of the international community to deal with the immediate needs of the people in the region.</P>
    <P>The voluntary organisations working in these countries do not have the resources or personnel on the scale required.  What is required is a huge, well co-ordinated and well resourced international rescue operation or disease and famine will set in taking tens of thousands more lives.  We have seen massive US resources used in times of aggression and war and those massive resources, in particular, will be crucial to determining how many of those who have avoided death so far will survive the aftermath of this disaster.</P>
    <P>Irish people have a long tradition of interest in and solidarity with the people of Central America. They solidly supported moves towards democracy and opposed attempts during the 1980s to overthrow the democratically elected <Col N="1066" /> government in Nicaragua.  The Irish economy has been doing well in recent years, the Exchequer is literally awash with money but it is now time for us to put our hand deep into the national pocket and to show that we really do care by making a very substantial contribution to the rescue operation.</P>
    <P>The churches, businesses and individuals will, I hope and expect, respond to this emergency. There is already evidence a response is being made by the community.</P>
    <P>By international standards the Government's response has been disappointing.  The US, of whom I have often been critical, added $10 million to the $70 million it had already pledged.  This week Spain is expected to approve an aid package worth £65 million.  Even Cuba, a small country which has enormous economic problems because of a vicious US embargo, has agreed to write off debts worth £32.5 million.</P>
    <P>Even if this disaster had never happened the countries of Central America would have required substantial aid and assistance over a prolonged period to help overcome their ongoing problem of hunger and poverty.  The events of the past few days have meant that the scale of aid required has increased substantially and the period over which it will be needed extended further. A reconstruction programme is required that may take decades.</P>
    <P>A good development has been the refocusing of attention on the level of Third World debt and the problem debt repayments create for impoverished and weather threatened countries.  People are beginning to ask what sense it makes for poor countries to have to pay £5 in debt repayments for every £1 received in aid.  Third World countries currently owe western banks £1.4 million. Honduras, the country worst hit by this disaster, has a foreign debt of $4 billion and makes annual interest payments of $450 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move by a number of countries to look seriously at the question of cancelling Third World debt or, at the minimum, suspending repayments.  This is the key to bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world. The British are seeking suspension of Third World debt.  While this does not go far enough it is an important move.  The Minister of State welcomed it.</P>
    <P>It is easy for this county to support calls for writing off Third World debt because Ireland is not a creditor nation and is owed little or nothing in this regard.  If we want other countries to write off debt we should be prepared to show we are serious by substantially increasing our overseas development aid, and doing so in an proportionate manner.  There is no evidence the Government is willing to do so.  The Estimates published yesterday suggest the Department of Finance has won the day yet again.  It is unforgivable at a time of unprecedented economic growth that our ODA contribution as a percentage of GNP is falling. The UN target is 0.7 per cent and the Government set a target of 0.45 per cent by the <Col N="1067" /> end of 2002.  However, it will decline from 0.31 per cent last year to 0.29 per cent this year.  This is indefensible and shameful.</P>
    <P>As a Government and a country we cannot stand over that kind of reduction, especially when we are doing so well.  I do not accept the argument that because we are doing well we cannot afford to make our contribution in this way. There might be some argument if we were doing very badly economically.  I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's proposal on legislation.  It would provide a baseline, not a ceiling, with regard to a proportionate contribution.  The Minister should undertake to introduce such legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The death and destruction visited upon the populations of Honduras and Nicaragua in recent days is a human tragedy of enormous proportions.  Everything that relatively wealthy and developed nations, such as Ireland, can do to relieve the human suffering in the afflicted countries must be done.  I hope the Government will act decisively in discharging its moral and practical obligations to those who have lost so much.</P>
      <P>The tragedy tells us many stories.  Primarily, there is the human story of loss of lives, homes and livelihoods.  It also tells us of the changing land uses and agricultural practices that have been developed by multi-national corporate businesses, of the replacement of stable local economies by the unwieldy, unstable imperatives of the global economy and of climate change.</P>
      <P>The mountainsides of Honduras and Nicaragua no longer have trees to absorb rainfall, hold back landslides or stop top soil being swept away and deposited into swollen rivers.  Rain that fell in areas that have been deforested to make way for cash crops intended for export to the developed world could not be absorbed.  Instead the soils were carried away to be deposited as sediment in the river beds.  This diminished the rivers' capacities and greatly exacerbated the consequent flooding.</P>
      <P>This element of the tragedy occurred as a result of growth economics and only tangentially as a consequence of the weather.  Hurricanes happen and multinationalism is prepared to deal with the risk through forest clearance and monoculture production.  However, the multinationals also aim to ensure that they will not affect insured profits excessively.  Tragically, it is the indigenous population that suffers the loss of life, property and livelihood as a result of the barbarous imperatives of the stock markets of New York, Tokyo and the other wealth centres of the developed world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most authoritative assessment available on the phenomenon of climate change concluded that a worldwide carbon dioxide emissions reduction of 50 to 70 per cent is necessary to contain it.  If Hurricane Mitch was an act of God then perhaps it was substantially the act of a God who takes the form of emission belching developed nations, which every day contribute to climate <Col N="1068" /> instability.  The Kyoto climate protocol, agreed last year, falls far short of addressing this problem, calling for only a 5 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.  Nonetheless, the Kyoto agreement is important in acknowledging the reality of climate change and it constitutes a significant first step that all parties, especially the US, should ratify as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The world is warming discernibly and also witnessing widespread climatic disruption and long-term ecosystem changes.  A bold and visionary course will be required if it is not to be plunged into climatic catastrophe.  The Green parties of the world have called on the nations gathered at the conference of the parties to the Kyoto agreement and on climate change, which is convened in Buenos Aires, to commence a response sufficient to the challenge.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said today that already we cannot meet our commitments.  In consequence, we are facing a bill of approximately £2.3 billion, yet when I have raised this matter at meetings of the Whips I have been told that more important matters need to be addressed first.  I cannot think of a more important matter.</P>
    <P>We review that goal as the evidence of the effects of climate change, allied to the destruction of local economies by multinationalism, forms the images that fill the international news stories on our TV screens.  It is clear that radical and binding commitments must be made in the following matters: we must drastically reduce, then eliminate, the use of fossil fuels; we must use energy more efficiently and from clean renewable sources; we must preserve the many valuable natural services, including climatic stability, provided by intact ecosystems.</P>
    <P>This latter point is a crucial lesson of the Hond-uras-Nicaragua tragedy.  The Central American Council on Forests and Protected Zones has reported that widespread deforestation in Central America contributed significantly to the devastation triggered by Hurricane Mitch, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua.  An average of 118 acres of forest are lost every hour in the region through the activity of multinationals based in the United States and elsewhere.  This rape of the natural resources of poorer nations is set to get worse under the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.  That is something I hope we will get an opportunity to debate in this House.</P>
    <P>Through two financing sources, the kind of investment that is needed can quickly commence. First, fossil and nuclear energy subsidies, running to some tens of billions of US dollars equivalent annually, should be redirected.  Second, a tax on carbon emitting energy consumption should be enacted to favour employment by lowering income taxes and to fund transformation of energy and preservation of natural services.  Some would say that eliminating fossil and nuclear subsidies and enacting a serious carbon energy tax is not politically realistic, but only a few years ago <Col N="1069" /> it was regarded as unrealistic to envisage a world not teetering on the brink of nuclear destruction. Facing that potential calamity, the nations of the world stepped back from the brink.  Now, confronting the more subtle but no less serious threat of massive climatic destruction, we can take the first steps to avert another looming catastrophe.</P>
    <P>If we factor in the full costs of fossil energy, a rapid shift to clean sources is obviously the leastcost solution.  Concerted public investment can produce technological breakthroughs that will make a swift transition feasible.  For instance, solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines are already the fastest growing power sources. Biomass is an increasingly important energy source.  Great potential exists in hydrogen.  Transformed energy systems would yield other benefits such as reduced air pollution.  As a primary step toward both climatic stability and global equity, the world should set the goal of providing photovoltaic electricity to the two billion people in developing lands who have no electricity service. If we fail to summon the political will now to invest in new ways of ordering the world's economy, instances like Hurricane Mitch will become, in effect, instruments of the resource war that the rich nations of the world have waged against the world's poorer countries throughout the latter part of this century.</P>
    <P>Every year we have heard excuses for more and more catastrophes.  I attended the Berlin conference of the parties where it was said that we are now also facing a very serious problem in terms of insurance, that we will no longer be able to insure.  This is not simply a matter of El Nino. This is happening now.  We cannot continue to think that we can solve it through some sort of technological fix.  That is not going to happen.  We have to take our commitments under the Kyoto Agreement very seriously.  That is not happening currently because the Minister has his head in the sand.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House unduly. The bulk of Irish aid has been given towards dealing with long-term development objectives, and that is desirable.  I wish to make a plea for an increase in funding for emergency and humanitarian systems.  That is what is required to deal with the situation in Honduras and Nicaragua.  I would like to see these two countries included in the priority list.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate this morning on the really terrible effects on the people and economies of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. The force of this hurricane was unprecedented this century and the effects on the people were calamitous.  These effects are too enormous to grasp even at this stage.  As reports come in we are in daily contact with people on the ground. <Col N="1070" /> Our own NGOs through APSO and Trócaire are in daily contact with us.</P>
      <P>Deputies have criticised the lack of rapidity in our response.  I can only deal with appeals as they come in.  I was immediately in contact with the NGOs and was in a position within a matter of two days to respond to the appeals by APSO and Trócaire.  When another appeal came in, I responded to that as well.</P>
      <P>I would like to have been able to give more, given the scale of this disaster.  We are committed to being in for the long haul because there will be tremendous reconstruction and rehabilitation requirements.  Ireland stands ready to help these poor people who have been so badly hit.</P>
      <P>The impact of this tragedy was compounded by the fact that the people were already very poor. They lacked the capacity to act on the prediction, to carry out evacuations.  In rich countries like America, when storms like this are threatened, there is mass evacuation because they have the technological capacity to protect their people and to respond immediately where disaster strikes. That is not the case in these poor countries.</P>
      <P>That leads me to the endorsement of many Deputies of the view that the capacity of Honduras and Nicaragua to repay debt is hopeless.  I understand that the total indebtedness of the region is about £70 billion US dollars.  It is clear, in the light of the fact that these countries have been set back by 40 or 50 years in terms of their economic development, that their capacity to pay off this debt is now unsustainable.  I support the efforts of European countries who have said they are prepared to write off the debt, France and Spain, who have long-standing connections with the region.  It has prompted an international debate on the debt issue, not before time.  There is a need now for global solidarity on the debt issue.  Ireland is not an international creditor.  It contributes on a bilateral basis to HIPC; in Tanzania and Mozambique we are contributing to the reduction of their debt.  Recently the Minister of Finance announced that Ireland would be partaking in and contributing to a £31 million debt package, the IMF and the World Bank initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that, as anybody who knows anything about development, and particularly Ministers with responsibility for overseas development, can see that our development efforts are being undermined every day by the debt obligations of the heavily indebted poor countries. Many of the countries which we are helping with long-term development assistance are spending more on their debt repayments than they are spending on the health and education of their people.  That is unconscionable.  In the short to medium term the international community must come together.  Deputy Mitchell suggested the appointment of an independent commission on debt.  It is an interesting idea, and we will be exploring this and other suggestions at the next meeting of development Ministers.  It has already been put on the European agenda at Monday's <Col N="1071" /> meeting of the general affairs committee and Ireland supported the proposals on debt.</P>
    <P>In relation to the debate on our ability to maintain and sustain our commitment to the percentage of GNP aid targets, we cannot cherrypick the implications of our growth.  If we take the good things, the good results to our economy, the ability to bring down long-term unemployment, the ability to make a better life for our people, we cannot then say that we cannot afford to be generous to the poor of the world.  The next budget should be a caring budget which deals with the disadvantaged here and abroad.  There is no battle between the two issues.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputies have supported my stance on this issue.  There is cross-party support for and consensus on our international obligation to reach targets for aid.  They are not negotiable.  We signed up to those targets and the percentage of GNP is the internationally recognised and agreed basis on which we decide our aid budget.  I hope some movement will be forthcoming from the Department of Finance and the Cabinet collectively on this issue.  I thank Deputies for their support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most off-putting aspect for tourists to foreign countries is the problem of overcharging.  It is a shock to people when they read in the newspapers that Ireland is viewed by foreign tourists as an expensive destination.  We have grown up with the idea that Ireland is a low cost destination, but the statistics prove that foreigners, the people who count in terms of tourism because they spend the money, are not impressed with the price structure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Americans and continentals are shocked by the cost of ordinary commodities, which has a negative impact on the tourism industry.  I ask the Minister to allude to this point in his reply.  Why is Ireland regarded as an expensive holiday destination? What does the Minister propose to do about it?  Food, car hire and hotels are regarded by tourists as essential items, but they consider the prices much too high.  If the prices are not brought down, we will lose business that might otherwise come to this country.</P>
      <P>The juicy tourism destinations in Europe are Paris, London, Rome and Athens.  They are the capitals of old empires and areas of culture.  They have the remnants of ancient civilisations on which our civilisation is built.  Ireland has particular attractions such as the wild beauty of its countryside and the friendly nature of the people. It would be a pity to destroy that because people killed the goose that laid the golden egg by trying to make money too quickly.  This results from overcharging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Last night I got a taxi in Dublin.  The usual cost of the journey I make is £3, but last night I was charged £5.  One has no redress in such instances. Will the Minister consider setting up a hotline where tourists and citizens who feel they have got a bad deal by being overcharged or receiving inferior quality service can ring up and voice their complaints without the need to sit down and write a letter to which they do not get a satisfactory response?  There should be a better system under which people can lodge complaints.</P>
    <P>I was in Budapest in Hungary a year ago where overcharging is rife to the extent that many potential businesses and industrialists turn away from the country because of the free for all which exists in that regard.  On one occasion I was charged approximately £10 or £12 for a taxi journey that should have cost £2 to £3.  I remonstrated with the driver and he just laughed.  He said westerners have plenty of money and there was nothing I could do about it anyway, which was the case.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, I noted recently that the relevant Department of the British Government has taken up the issue of overcharging in Hungary with the authorities there.  Hungary is one of the emerging central east European countries and it has become a place where individuals are exploited and overcharging is a major issue.  We do not want Ireland to get a name as a place where there is widespread overcharging and the cost of services is much too high.</P>
    <P>The greatest boom to the tourism industry in Ireland is the advent of cheap access.  It must be clearly stated that the independent airlines brought about the boom in the tourism industry over the past ten to 12 years.  I take off my hat to Ryanair, Virgin Atlantic, British Midland and the other independent airlines who have brought the price of air travel down to a low level and given almost every individual the capacity to travel by aeroplane.  For example, if Manchester United is playing at home on a weekend, a huge number of working class people fly over to the match.  The reduction in air fares is the basis for the current boom in tourism.</P>
    <P>It is now possible to travel from Dublin to London by air for £60 or £70 return, to Paris and Brussels for a little more and to Rome for approximately £150.  They are unbelievable prices.  When I was the Fine Gael spokesman on transport between 1979 and 1980, I questioned Aer Lingus about its fare structure.  The then chief executive of Aer Lingus was adamant that the lowest economical return fare from Dublin to London was £208.  This is the type of problem which arises because of monopolies.</P>
    <P>The first independent international operator was Freddie Laker and he was followed by Ryanair. It is now possible to fly to London for £60 or £70.  If one converted the 1979-80 fare of £208, when Aer Lingus had a monopoly, into current day values, it probably would be £1,000.  It is appalling to allow companies to have a monopoly in any business because it discriminates against <Col N="1073" /> individuals.  Cheap access has multiplied the number of people coming to Ireland and I congratulate Ryanair and the others who helped bring that about.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte could be abolished because it gives very bad value for money.  Hoteliers from my area go abroad during the winter months at their own expense to attract visitors to Ireland.  They travel to England, Holland and the broader Continent of Europe, do a deal with bus companies and organise busloads of visitors who come to Ireland on the various car ferries.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be better advised to give the money allocated to Bord Fáilte to the hoteliers who band together and organise tours.  Former Deputy Jim White is doing a roaring trade in the Minister's county.  He is one of the people who have done wonders for the industry by bringing in tens of thousands of people each year.  The Minister should assist them financially as they are of the view that they have to do this work themselves. They do not bother with Bord Fáilte.  The Minister should also assist small towns and villages to open a local tourist office.</P>
    <P>Do we have to have a monstrosity of an organisation which is doing little for the tourism industry when there are brilliant individuals who can promote it when publicising their own hotels or restaurants?  The Minister should be innovative and clear away the cobwebs.  We do not need Aer Lingus or Bord Fáilte.  There are plenty of individuals who can do the job better and cheaper. We have a unique product to offer and we should sell it in the best way possible and at the cheapest price.  The Minister should establish a hot line.  If taxi drivers, restaurants or hotels are overcharging, the Minister should hop off them immediately. What is the point in writing to Bord Failte and receiving a letter three months later when the issue has clouded over?</P>
    <P>Hoteliers tell me that they cannot find trained staff.  What becomes of the graduates of the CERT schools &mdash; the primary training school is located in the Minister's constituency &mdash; or is it the case that there are not enough schools?  As a member of the European Union, there has to be give and take but many of our hotels and restaurants have to depend on staff from Spain, France and other continental countries.  Will the Minister explain why this is so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill which highlights the importance of the tourism industry which is the fastest growing sector of the world economy.  It seems that people throughout the world want to spend their money on travel, learning more about the world and themselves in the process.  Ireland has benefited from this growth but our success has not been a mere reflection of a global trend. Ireland has always been a quality destination, free from the stains of exploitation which have afflicted the industry in other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every location has something to offer the tourist. <Col N="1074" /> It is significant that the growth in tourism numbers has coincided with an awareness of the tourism potential of a broad spectrum of locations throughout the country, not just the traditional holiday areas.  If we wish to see this growth continue, we must think of Ireland not in terms of a few selected resorts but as a patchwork of towns, villages, parishes and regions, each of which has something to offer.</P>
    <P>People come to Ireland for a variety of reasons. Our island offers the visitor from abroad something unique &mdash; fresh air; closeness to nature; a less hurried pace of life; friendly, warm hospitable people; often something mundane as silence; the opportunity to hear birds singing, and to watch clear unpolluted water rushing over pebbles in a stream.  Others may be drawn by our culture and a wish to walk the same paths as Patrick Kavanagh, George Bernard Shaw, James Joyce or some of our famed musicians.  Many continue to come to see the land of their ancestors and to trace family ties.  For them, a visit to Ireland is often a personal pilgrimage.  Such visitors predominantly came from North America but more Australians whose ancestors may have been forced to leave in the last century are now able to make the long journey here.</P>
    <P>All our tourism attractions can be boiled down to a number of assets, namely, our environment, people and landscapes of such magnificent variety. Our people maintain a unique blend of warmth and hospitality, a desire not simply to please but to be of genuine assistance &mdash; qualities that they transmit to visitors in spite of language barriers.  Tourists realise that these qualities are genuine and not part of some careful choreographed show.</P>
    <P>Our success as a tourist destination is all the more remarkable when one considers our proximity to the sad events which afflicted the province of Ulster for 30 years.  These have been broadcast on television screens throughout the world and no doubt have had a dampening effect on overall tourism growth, especially in Border areas, but we have been able to attract people who knew that the troubles were restricted and at no time did we tell visitors to our shores that they could not or should not visit the North.  With the advent and consolidation of peace we will be able, in pursuance of cross-Border initiatives, to advise tourists to visit the North with more enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>As a native of a Border county, I am aware of how much tourism can develop as a result of the cessation of violence in the other part of the province. I am also aware that cross-Border initiatives in tourism are as natural as the many beautiful landscapes and features, not to mention the warmth of the people, which are shared by areas on both sides of the Border and do not respect lines drawn on a map.</P>
    <P>The river Erne flows majestically and imperceptibly from County Cavan to County Fermanagh. Anyone who has taken a boat trip along it can testify that it is only the local expert who can <Col N="1075" /> say when and where the Border has been crossed. Generally, the area is free of towers and barriers which may be associated with frontiers and divisions in other countries.  The more northerly section of the Erne-Shannon waterway, formerly the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel Canal, means that such a journey can be made in comfort and in a manner which has few parallels in terms of relaxation.</P>
    <P>The Erne-Shannon waterway is a shining example of the meaningfulness of cross-Border links to tourism in Border areas and the extent to which the revitalisation of these links can have an effect in areas other than the Border counties.  It has given a new lease of life to towns such as Ballyconnel and Ballinamore and areas in south Fermanagh which before the canal's reopening seemed to have been left in some tourism backwater. Great credit is due to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey; the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson; officials of the then Department of Tourism and Transport as well as of the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs who had the initiative to back this worthwhile venture.</P>
    <P>Another area with potential for the consolidation of cross-Border tourism links is the west Cavan pan handle, an area of unique natural beauty and where the Shannon has its source.  It is a paradise for those who relish proximity to nature &mdash; the walker, nature lover, geologist, artist and photographer.  For over a decade walkers and hikers have been served by the Cavan Way, a trail which allows the visitor to glimpse the past and present, from the megalithic burial tombs of Burren to the sweathouses used by local people until the beginning of this century.</P>
    <P>The Cavan Way connects with the much more extensive Ulster Way network of footpaths in Northern Ireland.  There is potential for the development of cross-Border cycling trails while plans are afoot to restore the old railway bridge spanning the Border between Blacklion, County Cavan, and Belcoo, County Fermanagh, a structure which fell victim to the hostilities and insecurities of the past.  I am glad to record my appreciation to the Minister for visiting the area with me and I wish to remind him, Bord Fáilte and his Department that we are still anxious to progress the Breffni mountain park proposal.  It is proposed to develop a mountain park encompassing the Cuilcagh mountain range in Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Another example of the potential for cross-Border initiatives is the village of Swanlinbar, which lies just south of the Cavan-Fermanagh border.  The parish of Kinawley straddles the Border between both counties.  It was a tourist resort and spa more than 200 years ago and rich people from all over the land travelled there to avail of its curative waters.  It is an area of stunning beauty surrounded by steep mountain ranges.  No one would think of promoting it without at the same time inviting the tourist to add to his visit with a trip to the neighbouring part of County <Col N="1076" /> Fermanagh to view the architectural marvels of Florencecourt or the even more spectacular Marble Arch caves, examples of the breathtaking architecture of nature itself.</P>
    <P>The development of cross-Border initiatives in these areas is not a gimmick.  They are as natural as one neighbour greeting another.  We have been conscious of the limitations of seasonality in the tourism industry but we have begun to neutralise this problem.  All of us want fine weather as the countryside appears so glorious in sunshine but we are realistic enough to know that rain, weather which is far from ideal, is often a fact of life, imposing the need to think in terms of &ldquo;weatherproof&rdquo; holidays.</P>
    <P>Angling has always been an important part of tourism in Border areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim.  For the committed fisherman the changes in weather are unimportant.  They seem content to sit along the shores of a river or lake in pouring rain.  The angling season does not end in September, and it is not unusual to hear foreign languages being spoken on the streets of those counties in October and later in the year.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for investment in the tourism sector have been taken up eagerly by the private sector throughout Ireland and credit is due to entrepreneurs in the Border area who invested in new tourism products before the cessation of violence and displayed great belief in the future of the country.  New hotels have been built, bedroom numbers in existing hotels and guesthouses have increased, while new leisure facilities have sprung up.  There has also been a much welcomed expansion of catering facilities such as cafes and restaurants serving food of the highest standards, frequently using local produce and stimulating the local economy in the process.  Our success as a tourist destination must not make us complacent, as we must not rest on our laurels but try to ensure that our attractiveness as a destination continues.</P>
    <P>Success brings its own responsibilities.  We must ensure that we do not kill or in any way endanger the goose that has laid the golden egg.  The environment is remarkably tenacious, but it is at the same time very fragile.  The unexpected growth in visitor numbers can make heavy demands on the existing infrastructure, whether in the form of large coaches churning up country roads or the equally damaging effects of people clambering over walls to visit a historical or archaeological site.  Thankfully, it is possible to lessen any dangers that might lurk on the horizon by intelligent, thorough and informed visitor management programmes. The tourist of today is a responsible person, aware of, and sensitive to, the need to leave nothing behind except footprints and take nothing away but good memories.</P>
    <P>Sight must never be lost in our marketing strategies of the importance of making the visitors to our shore not only content with their experience but also anxious to share their experiences with their friends at home.  Everyone in business knows that the best marketing consultant or publicist <Col N="1077" /> is a satisfied and happy customer.  There is an ongoing need to train and educate and to utilise skills that exist.</P>
    <P>Instruction in foreign languages for all those in tourism is essential.  Even the ability to utter a few phrases in a language, especially those less widely spoken such as Dutch or Swedish, can make a big impact.  The provision of tourist facilities is not just a one off transaction as it is part of a chain, every link of which must be right and in the best working order.  Everyone working along these chains in the areas of information provision, catering, accommodation, etc., needs to be made aware of how important are their roles.</P>
    <P>The importance of local initiatives in tourism development must not be underestimated.  People have an understandable pride in their localities and a desire to share them with others.  All of us take pride in our communities and parishes.  It is not just a product for them, but something vital which they have helped to shape and of which they are a part.  The Minister mentioned the uses to which the Internet is being put in promoting Ireland.  A marvellous aspect of it is that it is accessible to everyone, including rural communities, who can in turn use it to promote their areas. One does not need to have a degree in computer science to produce an attractive website.  The Internet enables small communities with tourism initiatives to share ideas and experiences, not only within Ireland but also throughout Europe. The provision of Internet and electronic mail facilities in primary schools has already led to the forging of strong links with other schools on the continent and as far away as Australia.  These can lead to exchange visits, and it should not be forgotten that the schoolchild of today is the tourist of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>An area that will play a more significant part in our tourism sector is the development of tourism for niche markets, catering for specialised interests.  We should constantly explore these possibilities, applying our best brains to it, not just from the marketing sector.  We have been very successful thus far.  An example of the long-term benefits is the close connections between tourism and the arts, especially cinema.  Ireland continues to be a prime location for movie makers. The contribution of a large, high-budget film crew to a local economy can be tremendous, but it does not end when the final scene has been shot, as cinema goers throughout the world, having seen the film, often seek to recapture some of the atmosphere by visiting the location.</P>
    <P>The village of Redhills in Cavan was put on the map of the world thanks to the filming of &ldquo;The Playboys&rdquo;.  We should not overlook what has been done by our homegrown cinematic talent, frequently working on a low budget.  Through their talents and skills they act as ambassadors for Ireland in its long and never-ending trek to attract more visitors to its shores.  The Minister is to be commended on his work earlier this week while in the United States at the premiere of &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo;.  I have no doubt his <Col N="1078" /> native county, Donegal, will benefit from the movie.  I wish every success to the county and the Minister's endeavours in this regard.</P>
    <P>It must not be forgotten that tourism promotion is a burden that should not be left solely on the shoulders of Bord Fáilte and local or regional organisations.  All of us have a responsibility to play our part, especially if our jobs involve travel overseas.  All branches of government, national and local, have their part to play, and no one who can make a contribution should be excluded.  Deputy Deasy rightly pointed out the great work undertaken by local voluntary organisations throughout the country in promoting their own areas.  During the darkest years of violence in the Six Counties, people from voluntary angling organisations in the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Fermanagh went to England and other European countries to promote their home areas when it was neither fashionable nor profitable.  They built up a customer base and the anglers return annually because they leave satisfied.  Through the efforts and good work of voluntary people in the angling industry a substantial tourist business was built up, which is a great credit to everybody involved. This happened during some of the most difficult years, when Ireland was getting adverse publicity on television screens throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Fate has not blessed Ireland with vast mineral resources.  However, it has provided us with two, inestimably richer resources &mdash; a beautiful environment and a warm and welcoming people. Unlike other resources, these will not run out but will renew themselves continuously.  We must ensure that the benefits of tourism are spread throughout the island.  Tourism has and will continue to contribute to the economy.  However, we should not only think of it in terms of money or as yet another product to be sold.  Our home is a beautiful place and our island has such natural attractions that we should want to share it with people from other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I hope tourism will be one of the main areas to be dealt with by the cross-Border bodies to be established under the British-Irish Agreement. The whole island will benefit if the 32-county tourism product is marketed as a single product.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I also welcome the increase in tourism spending from £22 million to £50 million at a time when we are seeing substantial increases in tourism numbers.  However, I query the current definition of &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;.  Closer examination of the figures will show that many people classified as tourists are business people. While their visits may impact in some way on tourism, it is time to assess the definition of what constitutes a tourist.  This might give a clearer indication of the numbers who are coming to Ireland specifically as a tourism destination. People who come to Ireland and spend money are welcome.  However, I would like to see the spend per head of genuine tourists in Ireland <Col N="1079" /> compared with other countries who do not have the same degree of business orientation.</P>
      <P>Over the years, respective Ministers for Tourism have concentrated on the traditional tourism areas.  It is understandable that the current Minister is responsive to the needs of his own county. However, these areas are saturated with tourists and the flow of money being directed towards their tourism development.  They need this development to sustain populations and employment and long may that continue.  However, we are entering a new phase of tourism in which we have to look at non-traditional areas in rural Ireland which have magnificent resources which they need assistance to develop.  This assistance may not be to the same degree as other areas have received in the past but we must give these areas priority status.</P>
      <P>The 13 counties mentioned, which include Cork and Kerry, attract high numbers of tourists. We must recognise that these areas suffer from declining populations and have few job opportunities outside basic agriculture, forestry and fishing.  We must assist these areas to provide alternative employment.  The Minister should consider areas outside the main tourism destinations.</P>
      <P>For example, east Galway is on the shores of Lough Derg yet Bord Fáilte has not spent money developing tourism in the area over the past 20 years.  I welcome the Minister's response in identifying small rural projects.  It is important that the Minister of the day visits such areas and recognises the initiative of private, small entrepreneurs who finance projects.  It is an added bonus when the Minister and the Government recognise such initiatives and the enthusiasm of those involved.</P>
      <P>I accompanied the Minister when he turned the sod on a major development in my community. In so doing, he recognised the initiative of two young brothers who cast aside 30 acres of reasonable agricultural land to develop a tourism facility which will bring people to the area and provide employment.  If the Government recognised such initiatives more often it would lead to a less costly method of developing tourism.  However, it is encouraging that it is being done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of litter causes me to question the seriousness of our commitment to tourism.  When one drives through a town, village or resort one is shocked at the amount of litter, particularly at weekends.  This can be seen outside discos and too often we blame young people.  We cannot label young people as the sole culprits.  The problem is more extensive.  Every person must take responsibility for the terrible litter problem.  If we pride ourselves as a tourism destination we must take the example of other continental countries who would not allow such a situation to continue. It is hard to know where to make a start in tackling this problem.  I do not know whether the Minister, or the Department of the Environment and Local Government have responsibility for <Col N="1080" /> this.  What legislation is the Department of the Environment and Local Government considering? However, it is a waste of time introducing legislation which is not implemented.</P>
    <P>Are we to look to schools to begin to make inroads into this problem?  Are schools the only hope left as all other efforts have failed?  Are we to turn to schools and ask what young people can do and how can we ask children to show pride? The Department of Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government or Tourism, Sport and Recreation must take the initiative as we have to put a stop to the present trend.  Has the Minister any plans in this regard?  The sooner we take the initiative in this case, the sooner something can be done to enhance the countryside. Visitors to this country cannot understand why smokers throw matches, cigarette packets and butts out of car windows.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to provide financial help to farmers outside of the designated areas who have insufficient quantities of winter feed; and if he will take applications for the fodder scheme from individual farmers who meet the criteria but who live outside designated areas.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23233/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the fodder scheme is to provide assistance to certain livestock farmers who face significant winter fodder problems. These problems have arisen due to the prolonged wet weather conditions experienced during the 1998 growing and fodder saving season.  It is recognised that farmers on peat or heavy clay soils in certain areas were particularly badly affected.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance under the fodder scheme is being made available to all sheep farmers with mountain grazings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers, with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons, in the worst affected areas in Counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 15,000 sheep farmers with mountain grazing.  A payment of £4 per ewe or hogget on up to 75 sheep per flock will be made.  Payment on suckler cows will be confined to farmers in designated district electoral divisions in the 12 counties.  It is estimated that there are more than 31,000 applicants for suckler cow premium in the areas affected &mdash; more than 5,000 of these are also small scale milk producers.  A <Col N="1081" /> fodder payment of £40 per cow up to a ceiling of £300 per applicant, equivalent to 7.5 cows, will be made.  Small-scale dairy farmers located in the DEDs designated in the 12 counties will qualify for a fodder payment of £30 per 1,000 gallons of quota up to a ceiling of £300 or 10,000 gallons. Dairy farmers with a quota of up to 35,000 gallons in 1998 will qualify.</P>
    <P>The areas in question were identified as the worst affected areas in a Teagasc survey completed in September.  While some farms outside the designated areas have fodder difficulties, these farms are generally located in geographical areas where fodder is more readily available. Accordingly, it is not planned that such farmers will be included in the scheme.  It should be noted that the payment on sheep is based on mountain grazings as per the sheep headage scheme and goes far beyond the 12 counties listed.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the scheme is to give immediate help to farmers in the worst affected areas and the approach which I have adopted is the best way of achieving that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments under the scheme, up to a maximum of £300 per applicant, are essentially lucky bag money.  Will the Minister inform the House how, by drawing a line on a map in one of the wettest years we have experienced, it can be determined that a farmer on one side of the line is entitled to the payment while a farmer experiencing similar difficulties &mdash; namely, lack of fodder or poor quality fodder and an inability to sell his cattle &mdash; on the other side of the line is ineligible for payments under the scheme?  On behalf of the 90 per cent of farmers who will not receive any payment, I ask the Minister if he is prepared to accept applications directly from individual farmers who are experiencing a serious fodder crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the bad weather experienced in June and July of this year, Teagasc carried out a survey in August which was completed in September.  I was then asked to introduce a fodder scheme to address the problem and decided the Teagasc survey offered the best way to proceed.  I asked Teagasc to outline the worst affected areas and I am arranging for payments to be made on that basis.</P>
      <P>Adverse weather conditions have been experienced in this country for many centuries and difficulties for farming arise out of those every year. This year was a particularly bad one.  Fodder schemes have been introduced in the past which, in virtually all cases, were regarded as unsatisfactory for one reason or another.  I want to use the limited amount of money available to make expeditious payments directly to those farmers worst affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he is hiding behind Teagasc in regard to this matter. Teagasc identified many more areas in its survey and it was the Minister and his Department <Col N="1082" /> who decided on the final number of counties.  We are all aware that the areas which have been included in the scheme are entitled to it but I cannot understand why the Minister will not allow individual applications to be made given that prices are far worse now than they were when the Minister announced the scheme under remarkable conditions at the ploughing championships. The Minister did not know then whether £10 million or £16 million would be made available; there was disarray in the camp on that occasion.  Perhaps that was because the Minister for Finance had the final say in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for revision of the income support system for the beef sector in general are contained in the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals.  Negotiations are continuing in the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the proposals which, as they currently stand, I do not regard as being sufficiently favourable to the type of production carried out in this country.  The particular situation of dry stock farmers will be taken into account in any agreement by Ireland to the final outcome.</P>
      <P>As regards the short term, the current market weakness in the beef sector, which primarily results from the collapse of the Russian market, has put downward pressure on prices paid to producers throughout the Irish cattle and beef sector. However, the improvement in the intervention arrangements which I negotiated in October, along with the 21 per cent increase in export refunds, has had the effect of arresting the decline in prices and bringing about a definite upward movement which should continue over the coming weeks.  It is also the case that the current system of support enables a considerable level of direct payments to be made to beef producers.</P>
      <P>I have established a task force on beef to examine the future of the sector as a whole from primary production to the marketing of the final product.  I will be asking this group to draw up an action plan aimed at putting the sector as a whole on a firm and long-term footing so that it can confidently and vigorously face the challenges ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I think he is missing the point.  Does the Minister accept that a system which results in 80 per cent of the available supports, of the order of approximately £1 billion, ending up with approximately 20 per cent of producers is fair or equitable? Is a system which excludes beef heifer producers, <Col N="1083" /> a very important sector of the industry, fair or equitable?  Is the level of suckler cow premium fair?  We seem to forget that the suckler cow is the genesis of the beef industry in Ireland. Has the Minister seen the survey produced by the Roscommon Smallholder Action Group on rural living 1991-6 and have its contents been studied by him or his Department?  Is a system where two thirds of the 100,000 dry stock farmers are earning less than £5,500 per year acceptable?  Some of those farmers are on the poverty line and are asking how they should approach voluntary organisations to seek assistance.  Is the current system a failure and has the Department studied how serious the problem is because it has failed to allocate, distribute and target support prices to those who need it most?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While substantial direct payments are made to farmers, a number of studies have shown that a considerable amount of that money &mdash; approximately 80 per cent &mdash; went to the top 20 per cent of producers in the early stages.  That figure has levelled with approximately 70 per cent of payments now going to the top 30 per cent of producers.  There is an imbalance there.  In the context of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, I am examining the current payments system.</P>
      <P>There will be an opportunity to have a more equitable distribution of those payments as the proposals allow for direct payments from Brussels and a national envelope which will allow member states facilitate small and medium sized farmers who are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  Irrespective of prices, farmers who are too small still find themselves in difficulty.  In addition, there is the anomaly of farmers not receiving payment for heifers, a matter which is being actively examined.</P>
      <P>The Department has models of payments and how they are distributed and in the context of the negotiations will seek to have a more equitable distribution so that we can establish the industry on a sounder footing for the future.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister seen the two proposals put forward in the survey carried out by the Roscommon Smallholders Action Group which would significantly increase the income of smallholders, particularly in the dry stock sector? The survey suggested a tiered area based system and a tiered direct payment system.  Has the Department given any consideration to either of these or will the survey form part of the discussion when the Agenda 2000 proposals are being formulated?  I agree with the Minister that national envelope payments should be targeted at low income farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation in July last providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997.  The Libyan Government, through the General Peoples Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.  Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle.  To establish the reasons for these delays which were of concern both to me and the Government our ambassador in Rome, who is accredited to Libya, visited Tripoli again in mid-October. The ambassador was assured there was no political blockage to the agreement and that it was now a matter for Irish exporters to pursue contracts with the purchasing agency in Libya. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities through every possible channel with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice.  Our position is that an official agreement has been reached with the Libyan authorities and that it should be honoured.</P>
      <P>Iran was a traditionally important market for Irish beef until 1996.  I am pleased to say that a veterinary protocol was signed in Dublin on 29 October 1998 providing for detailed arrangements for the immediate resumption of the export of beef to Iran.  The successful conclusion of this protocol followed a week long visit here by a veterinary delegation from Iran and the decision in principle by Iran to re-open its market to Irish beef which I had negotiated in Tehran two weeks previously.  The conclusion of beef contracts is now a matter for the industry but I hope these will be completed with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the short term, the current market weakness in the beef sector which results from the collapse of the Russian market has put downward pressure on prices paid to producers. However, the improvement in the intervention arrangements which I negotiated this month <Col N="1085" /> along with the 21 per cent increase in export refunds has had the effect of arresting the decline in prices and bringing about some upward movement. On a number of occasions I have indicated to meat processors that the full benefit of the improved intervention arrangements should be availed of and that the commensurate returns should be passed on to producers.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the EU Commission that everything be done to maintain the existing commercial infrastructure in Russia so that it continues to be a viable economic market when the Russian economy improves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Minister is blaming exporters, that everything was all right with the Libyan deal but that for some strange reason exporters did not follow through on it.  I am not blaming anybody because I do not know who is responsible, but the Minister announced that contracts were in order.  What status have these contracts?  Are they pieces of paper which nobody takes any notice of?  The Minister said it is up to exporters to use the facility.  However, according to my information one of the exporters bought cattle which did not go to Libya.  It is a cruel thing for a Minister or the Government to make an announcement that this trade had recommenced.  Several farmers held their cattle for two or three weeks and got five pence per pound less for them at the market.</P>
      <P>The same situation pertains to Iran.  The Minister said the Iranian market is open, but how can any farmer believe him?  How do we know what status it has?  I think the Minister is not giving us a full account.  Is it true that the Australians wiped our eye and that we have not a hope of getting into the market?  The Minister should come clean.  The worst thing of all is to believe a market is open when there is not a hope in hell of us doing business there.  I want the market to open and the Minister wants it to open, but it is not possible to say to farmers that the Iranian market has any status given what happened in Libya.  What status has the contract and did the Australians wipe our eye?</P>

      <P>The situation is quite straightforward. An agreement was reached with a Libyan delegation and signed by representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the delegation on 25 July.  It was then endorsed by the Peoples Assembly in Tripoli.  During that time I kept people informed that the agreement was reached, signed and then endorsed by the Peoples Assembly.  It was then a matter for the trade to deliver on the agreement.  I expect the Libyan authorities to honour the agreement which was signed in good faith by both sides.  I recall one of the major people in the trade arriving back from Tripoli to Dublin and announcing he was in a position to begin trading.  I am not sure whether the Deputy received information that either that trader or somebody else bought cattle for that market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Charter of Rights for Farmers sets very specific targets for payment of grants under the headage and premium schemes.  So far, those targets have either been met or indeed surpassed. The position is that in the period since 1 January 1998, £743 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU livestock and arable aid schemes of which more than £443 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1998 cattle headage scheme commenced on 26 September 1998, a full three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  At present 79 per cent of cattle headage and beef cow applicants have been paid in full. To date more than £93 million has been paid under the 1998 headage schemes.  This compares most favourably with the position in 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>Payments at the increased rate of 80 per cent under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 20 October 1998 which is ahead of the commencement date of 4 November 1997 under the 1997 scheme.  Normally under EU regulations, 60 per cent advance payments are made and may not commence until 1 November.  The increase from 60 per cent to 80 per cent and bringing forward the payment date was in recognition of the bad weather and the decline in prices and income to farmers.  To date more than £87 million has been paid to 77 per cent of May 1998 applicants under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 6,000 cattle headage and suckler cow applications have not yet been cleared at local office level because of queries with the farmers concerned.  All these farmers have been contacted on one or more occasions with a view to resolving the outstanding queries.  Of those 6,000 cases more than 4,500 have cleared area aid <Col N="1087" /> applications which means they can be paid as soon as the relevant problems at local office level are resolved.</P>
    <P>Some 132,000 area aid applications were received in 1998.  Of these, 88 per cent have been processed for payment including more than 93 per cent of arable land applications.  The area aid unit is continuing the process of contacting all outstanding cases by telephone and letter to expedite payments in all these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>I put it to the Minister that there are approximately 10,000 files either in the area aid office in Hume House or in the DVO offices on which, for whatever reason, payment is not being made.  I have appealed to the Minister many times to reopen the telephone lines into Hume House but those appeals have fallen on deaf ears.  It is a disgrace that those 10,000 farmers cannot contact the Department to request to see their own files.  The Minister referred to 77 per cent of payments having been made.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I announced earlier this week that interim arrangements had been agreed between our respective Departments to put a national framework plan in place for commonages in Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  This interim plan is being put in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans and will incorporate the main environmental measures in the agri-environmental programme already agreed with the EU Commission.  Under the national interim plan ewe premium quota rights in all of the commonages concerned will now be reduced by 30 per cent from 1998 levels.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this measure the farmers concerned will be able to apply for the new rural environment protection scheme, which provides for an annual payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres.  These enhanced payments will be available to any farmer in the areas concerned wishing to join REPS and indeed to farmers already fully participating in REPS in those areas.  The average payment for an existing REPS participant with 80 acres in the areas concerned will increase from £4,960 to £6,400 annually. The maximum payable will increase from £6,200 to £9,400 annually.</P>
      <P>An alternative compensation scheme will be made available by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for farmers who do not wish to join REPS.  Application forms for the new REPS measure may be obtained from my Department's local offices where copies of the revised scheme document and specification will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in the counties concerned on their 1998 area aid application have been identified and are now being written to by my Department.  They are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  Arrangements have been made with the meat export slaughter plants to dispose of the ewes concerned between now and 4 December at no cost to the farmer.  The 1999 ewe premium entitlement of the farmers <Col N="1089" /> concerned will be limited to 70 per cent of their 1998 quota and the 1999 sheep headage entitlement will be limited to 70 per cent of their 1998 entitlement.</P>
    <P>The farmers concerned are already entitled to a payment of up to £300 under the winter fodder scheme for farmers with mountain breeding ewes. To assist sheep farmers who are subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quota I am making arrangements to pay an additional £10 per ewe on the 70 per cent balance of their quota.  It is expected that all of these payments will be made during December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that 30 per cent is extreme?  Does he think it is fair that a person with 400 acres of land on a commonage will be subject to the same measures as somebody with 50 acres of land?  The Minister said there will not be any cost to the farmer but the farmer will not get any money for the ewes when he brings them to the factory.  The real winners in this scheme are the factory owners and transport companies.  The Minister talked about the framework plan, and I hope to return to that subject again if the opportunity arises, but when will the Department have the framework plan up and running?  Some months ago we had the ten acre rule.  Farmers in these areas who could have been included in the REPS cannot put in a plan because they do not know what they will have to sign in relation to the framework plan.  Furthermore, what is the Department doing about factories near the Border that are buying in lambs in the middle of the night?  Does the Minister think that is fair?  We are introducing a ewe cull scheme yet lambs are being brought in from another country in the middle of the night.  Why do they not bring them in during the day so that we can see what they have?  What is the Minister doing about that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, it would be wrong of us to object to somebody bringing in lambs as we are the biggest exporters to other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to adopt the attitude of the Welsh and French farmers.  I do not know why they are doing that but we must be careful how we react because we have to ensure other markets remain open to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the new interim framework arrangements opens the way for farmers with commonages but there will be compensation.  A total of £80 per acre is a great start and it is £20 more than was available under the existing scheme.  With the additional moneys that will be paid, compensation is fair in that area.  An additional £10 will be paid directly to sheep farmers, not to the factory.  That is important because it is a way of getting money to them.  Up to now it <Col N="1090" /> would have cost them money to have the animals killed.  This will save on the fodder scheme but it is intended this scheme will end by 4 December. Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ewes have to be taken off and in the interests of animal health, the perception of farmers, etc., that should be done as quickly as possible.</P>

In conformity with this provision, Exchequer funding for the sector is channelled through Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has made a submission to my Department seeking funding over five years to meet the capital development needs of the private colleges as well as the Teagasc colleges and some local Teagasc training centres.

Does the Minister of State agree that the Department and Teagasc have depended on the religious orders to pump money into these colleges, and now that numbers in the orders are down there are serious difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numbers in the Salesian College in Pallaskenry are down from 107 to 79 because of the difficulties in farming, which means a reduction of £80,000 in the college's income.  Some students cannot pay full fees because of their parents' difficulties. Does the Minister of State agree that there is a serious difficulty in this area?  The decision of Teagasc and the Minister to reduce the 1995-6 contribution of £200,000 to these private colleges <Col N="1091" /> to £100,000 and to nil in 1997-8 suggests that the Minister and his Department have lost confidence in training farmers in these private colleges.</P>

Teagasc makes the decisions on what it does with the £20 million of that sum it devotes to training and education.  The difference between staffing levels and equipment in the private colleges is a matter for Teagasc and the Association for Private Agricultural and Horticultural Colleges. There are seven agricultural colleges and two commercial horticultural colleges.  There are currently 682 pupils attending those colleges.</P>
      <P>Teagasc provided £200,000 for maintenance in 1996 and £100,000 in 1997 and it is understood that due to budgetary constraints in 1998 it was unable to give any money.  However, it is for Teagasc to decide what to do with this money.</P>

The electrical equipment in many of them is falling apart and much of the other equipment and stock is over 25 years old but the colleges cannot replace it.  If the Government was sincere about this matter it could earmark some of the money via Teagasc for the private colleges, which had to be done in the past.  Deputy Kitt mentioned the Franciscan college in Mountbellew. I understand that it is possible to make a case to the European Union under a Structural Fund provision and that the private colleges may be entitled to funding under a particular subhead. Will the Minister of State tell us if this has been investigated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the installation aid scheme were detailed in the scheme document and were supplemented by a booklet of operational guidelines which enabled the young farmer, in conjunction with a consultant or an adviser, including a Teagasc adviser, to make a valid application to my Department for installation aid.</P>
      <P>The operational guidelines gave a detailed list of the supporting documentation to be submitted with an installation aid application, which included a recently certified copy of the Land Registry folio showing the applicant as the registered owner.  The guidelines also pointed out that payment of the premium would not be made until this evidence of registration was received in my Department.  There were no other guidelines issued to consultants or to Teagasc in this regard.</P>
      <P>In view of the large volume of applications on hand in the Department when the scheme was suspended on 7 August 1997 there was some delay in having all applications examined.  A number of the applications on hand at that stage were not accompanied by the Land Registry folio showing the applicant as the registered owner. Rather than reject these applications it was decided to accept any such applications which were accompanied by evidence that the transfer documents had been lodged for registration in the Land Registry by 7 August 1997.  Payment of installation aid was then made on receipt of evidence of completion of registration.  There was no correspondence with Teagasc in relation to the suspension of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is a very unsatisfactory situation.  He will be aware that a number of people lodged applications with private planners as well as Teagasc before 7 August 1997.  They were given the impression that once the Land Registry details were completed they would be eligible for the grant.  My office was advised orally by an official from the Minister's Department that this would be the case and that a letter would issue confirming that, if a question which I had tabled on the matter was withdrawn.  Many people had lodged applications in good faith, but those applications could not be finalised because of difficulties in the Land Registry office.  Will the Minister agree it is sharp practice that those applications are being disallowed. Given that there is not a huge number of applications, will the Minister entertain them?  Many will not fulfil the criteria for the new scheme which is being mooted.</P>

      <P>The situation in regard to that scheme and its history is unsatisfactory.  Younger farmers made their applications in good faith. Towards the end of 1996 it was signalled that money was running out because, as with many of those schemes, they were front-loaded.  Teagasc should have accelerated the processing of those applications and got them into the Department as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless about 700 to 800 were with Teagasc when the scheme was suspended. I obtained approval from the Department of Finance to reopen the scheme.  The past year has been taken up with seeking EU approval to have the scheme up and running.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reason for the delay was that the Commission did not want any degree of retrospection and did not want to entertain any applications in the pipeline or with Teagasc.  I have obtained approval from the Department of Finance and the Commission for the scheme.  I will read my note on the matter so that everybody will be clear about it.  The scheme will be open to young qualified farmers, setting up in the farm on or after 1 January 1995.  This period of retrospection of the scheme will enable intending applicants under the 1994-7 scheme, who had not submitted a valid application to the Department by the date of suspension of the scheme &mdash; in other words those in the pipeline &mdash; to apply under the revised scheme and in accordance with the revised conditions.  The revised conditions are those drawn up with Macra na Feirme and the young farmers earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I expect the vast majority of applications will qualify under the new scheme.  I will have a look at any particular hardship cases.  I totally agree with Deputy Deasy that the young farmers in question need every encouragement to set up in farming and they made their applications in good faith.  It certainly was not the fault of the applicant that these matters were held up.  I am keeping a close eye on the matter.  I have spent some time with the Commission with a view to ensuring the applications in the pipeline are allowed to be processed.  I expect that virtually all applications will qualify and I will look into any hardship cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that the new scheme will be in operation fairly soon.  However I would remind him he promised Deputy Bradford on an Adjournment debate in February that it was open.  Will the Minister give the exact date when the scheme will be reopened?  Will he accept it is difficult to understand the reason a young farmer must have the deed completely finalised before he qualifies for a grant of approximately £5,500, whereas his counterpart who accepts the EU pension scheme need only have a dealing number?  It is difficult <Col N="1095" /> to understand how the Department of Agriculture and Food can pay up to £100,000 over a ten year period on a dealing number while young farmers must wait until all the technicalities have been completed &mdash; in the event that a piece of land has to be taken off arising from a family settlement &mdash; which may take two years, before installation aid is paid.  Will the Minister remove this anomaly and give an indication as to when the scheme will be reintroduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford is correct.  I obtained Department of Finance approval either late last year or early this year.  In any subsequent Adjournment debates I would have indicated that that approval had been obtained.  The difficulty arose when I had to get Commission approval.  I could have gone ahead with the scheme in February or March but I would have left behind those unfortunate applicants whose applications were with Teagasc, consultants or advisers and I did not want to do that.  I understand an estimated 700 to 800 applications are with either private planners or Teagasc.  The Commission does not operate quickly.  It took until a week or so ago before I obtained final approval.  The scheme is reopening.  There is no difficulty, it has crossed all hurdles.</P>

Will the Minister direct Teagasc to notify those applicants who were in the pipeline and who were unlucky in relation to the cut-off date that they can reapply? A number of those files were sent back to the applicants.  Indeed, I produced three of them here from the one family.  I hope this is good news for that family in north Westmeath given that there is not much else there except farming.

I welcome the major investment in other on-farm investment schemes, particularly the reopening of the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme.  What start-up date is envisaged for the new schemes?  They will be warmly welcomed particularly in my part of the country where there are serious problems because of poor drainage and heavy rainfall and where additional housing and effluent control facilities have to be provided.  The funding is welcome. Will the Minister ensure his officials finalise the details of the scheme as soon as possible?</P>

The new scheme will be extremely restrictive given that it normally costs £7 million or £8 million per year to fund it and according to the Minister's Estimate £4 million will be available next year.  Do I take it that a huge category of farmers who obtained installation aid heretofore will not get it now?  What criteria will the Minister use to ensure the numbers are lowered?  Given the amount of money made available the numbers who will qualify will be lower.  I welcome the scheme but who will qualify?</P>

I put it to the Minister that in such cases, the hardship is inflicted by the Department of Agriculture and Food in dealing with these matters in a bureaucratic fashion.  Will he confirm that it was not Brussels which made the requirement that a certified copy folio be handed into the Department before the cheque issues but that the Department introduced that requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that it would be far more reasonable and fair if a certified copy transfer deed and dealing number could be regarded as sufficient to allow for the issue of cheque as happens in other areas outlined by Deputy Crawford and in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when dealing with social welfare entitlements.  Why are different criteria employed by the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="1097" /> Food which is causing the type of hardship which the Minister's backbenchers are asking to be cleared?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Exchequer money and one must take every possible precaution that the people who are entitled to these payments get them.  A certain amount of documentation is necessary to do that.  I will, however, look at ways to ensure valid applicants only receive the money while at the same time ensuring sufficient security in the system so that no overpayments or errors in payments are made.</P>
      <P>I recall that in the case of non-contributory old age pensions a number of years ago members of the Deputy's profession were, from time to time, not the most expeditious in dealing with many of these applications and held up the poor unfortunate old age pensioners' payments for several months.  The deed of transfer had to be signed before they received payment.  A modification to that scheme was introduced a number of years ago.  Once a person had a letter from a solicitor indicating that the property had been transferred, the pension was paid.  It speeded up the process a great deal.  I will look at this scheme as well to see if we might expedite matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Minister explain the criteria used to determine eligible areas? Were they based on weather, fodder, farm size or global assumptions on the part of Teagasc?  Does he realise that the areas excluded, certainly in south Mayo such as Taugheen, Ballindine, Garrymore, Irishtown and so on, are the classic small farm areas?  They are vulnerable, desperate and almost suicidal.  Does he realise farmers in these areas have been returning from marts week in week out unable to sell their sheep and cattle? They have no fodder and do not have money to buy any.  Unless they get this emergency aid now, they will have to dispose of their livestock for nothing &mdash; literally give them away or shoot them.  The situation is that bad.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reopen the file, examine the criteria used and indicate to Teagasc that he wants the scheme opened on an individual basis to enable those people to apply?  Some £300 might be an insignificant amount of money in global terms but to these farmers it is literally life and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The fodder difficulties created by the inclement weather during the year were based on a survey conducted by Teagasc.  Since the survey was conducted I was asked to introduce a scheme based on it.  It was put to me that Teagasc was an independent agency and would have the best people to carry out the survey because it had officials dealing directly with farmers.  It produced its study and the scheme was introduced based on it.  The areas submitted to the Department are those now applicable under this scheme.  There was no question that Teagasc included areas which the Department disregarded.</P>
      <P>No matter when or who draws lines, those within the areas which benefit will be satisfied or not terribly satisfied and those outside will be dissatisfied. That happened with the disadvantaged areas scheme and the severely handicapped areas scheme and I am sure it will happen with any further scheme in relation to regionalisation.  It is an exceptionally difficult thing to do and all one can do at the end of the day is throw one's hands in the air and say we will have to include the entire country.</P>
      <P>In this case we have a limited amount of money only to go towards the scheme.  That is the difficulty so we want to try to target it at those most in need.  We experienced bad weather and have had schemes in the past, including fodder voucher schemes and so on but at the end of the day the farmer ended up with little enough.  At least in this case those who qualify will get the payment directly.  Although it is not a large amount, it will help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are agencies and organisations which could help out rather than always looking to the taxpayer to foot the cost of paying compensation. <Col N="1099" /> Co-operatives, for example, could organise some fodder.</P>

Does he accept that the only way to resolve this problem is on an individual basis rather than, as he said, drawing lines on maps?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why he accepted £10 million from the Government as being sufficient to deal with this problem?  His colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as a result of &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo; and so on, was able to get £91.5 million of taxpayers money. Will he explain why he was prepared to accept £10 million as sufficient to solve this problem at the most difficult time in the history of farming, as stated by his backbenchers and county councillors around the country?

Is he sure he did not see those fields when he was looking over the wall at race meetings?  The weather does not discriminate &mdash; if it rains in Mayo all the land gets wet.  When it rains in Cork does it rain on the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour fellows?  This is an outrageous scheme.

I would have thought the Minister would have an up to date opinion on it because he often resides in Glengarriff.  He knows they were swamped out in the Borlin Valley, Ahihill, Douce and up to the pass at Kemaneigh.  They have nothing to feed their sheep.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the current level of cattle prices.  However, the low prices stem almost entirely from the loss of the Russian market since early autumn.  This market has been the major international outlet for our beef in recent years and exports in 1998 were projected to be of the order of 70,000 tonnes.  In addition, the renationalisation of the beef markets in the <Col N="1102" /> European Union following the BSE scares in 1996 has compounded the difficulties for Irish exporters, with the result that there is now a greater dependence on third country markets for our exports than at any time in the recent past.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned about the implications of the loss of the Russian market for the Irish beef industry for some months, and in early September I made strong representations to the Commission on the handling of the Russian crisis from the point of view of our beef trade and/or for a range of measures to be put in place to deal with the resultant market weakness.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Commission has responded favourably to my request and has introduced the following measures: a 21 per cent increase in export refunds, which is worth an extra 9p per pound; a widening of the intervention support through an increase in the eligible carcase weight limit to 360 kg and the inclusion of the O4 grade, which has increased eligibility of our steers from 15 per cent to almost 50 per cent; and an increase of 40 per cent in the processors' margin for cattle going into intervention.</P>
      <P>These market support measures have stabilised prices and, indeed, there are indications of a recovery in the market, as evidenced by the increases recorded in recent weeks.  However, there is scope for much further improvement in view of the 9p per pound increase in refunds, the flexibility of the intervention arrangements and the relatively strong market prices on the EU Continent.  I expect Irish beef processors to make full use of the supports available and to pass back to producers the full benefits in the prices paid for cattle.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that, to date, full use has not been made of the new arrangements by processors. For example, the first tender was less than 4,000 tonnes and this week the most recent tender was just over 4,000 tonnes.  The processors could have done better than that in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The income position of producers will also be assisted this autumn as a result of the Commission granting my request to increase the advance of the suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent, which is worth £45 million.  This will help the cash flow of producers, particularly those who are experiencing fodder shortages due to the wet summer.  These latter producers will also benefit from the fodder aid package which will be paid from national funds.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the factories should be well able to cope with the changes he secured under the refund scheme, but they have put the additional money into their pockets.  I do not want to play the innocent on this because I understand the system as well as the Minister.  It is difficult to do much in terms of the factories.  The Minister should have met representatives of the factories three weeks ago and explained that there will be other occasions when they will have to use the facilities of the Department of Agriculture and Food to seek refurbishment grants and so on, but he did not do that.</P>

      <P>There is extreme anger among the farming community that the 9p in the lb.  the Minister negotiated on behalf of farm producers has been taken by the meat factories.  The farmers <Col N="1104" /> have not benefited by his good efforts in Brussels or by the opening up of intervention, which has not been opened to the extent it should be opened given that less than half the total tenders have been used up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister negotiates with the European Commission in Brussels on behalf of the farming community to seek benefits for farm producers, can some new mechanism be introduced or some existing regulation be used to ensure such money is passed on to the primary producers who desperately need it so that it is not gobbled up by the processors?  I appeal to the Minister to examine if a new or existing mechanism can be used to ensure there is fair play and that primary producers get the proper price for their product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is unsatisfactory from the point of the view of the primary producers. Prices were at a reasonable level up to the end of July this year.  The collapse of the political and financial systems in Russia created extreme difficulties for Irish producers and our industry.  We were exporting 70,000 tonnes of beef to Russia, but suddenly that market collapsed and access to other markets had to be found.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Crawford's question, I visited Cairo on two occasions in the past seven or eight months.  We are extremely extended on the Egyptian market.  That market will import 90,000 or perhaps 100,000 tonnes of beef this year and it is by far our most important market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague visited Tripoli and he announced the re-opening of that market on that occasion, but unfortunately it has not been re-opened.  Regarding Europe, the Minister of the day must create the proper environment for the sector by getting secure benefits through negotiation.  The benefits secured were 9p per lb.  increase in export refunds bringing the total subsidy on beef up to 51p per lb.  Deputy Crawford mentioned figures of 68p per lb.  and 73p per lb.  Beef can be sold in intervention for 19p, 20p or 25p per lb.  when the subsidy of 51p per lb.  is taken into account. <Col N="1105" /> Regarding intervention, it was put to me by the industry that if there was an increase from 350 kg to 360 kg in the weight of cattle being put into intervention &mdash; I have not heard anything about that figure being reduced &mdash; if the O4 grade was allowed into intervention and if there was an increase in the processor's margin, they would be able to tender for 30,000 tonnes of beef.  Four tenders are available.  Two of them have been sent out and in regard to those two tenders only 8,000 tonnes of beef has been applied for.  That means that there will have to be 11,000 tonnes of beef applied for in the next two tenders, making a total of 22,000 tonnes of beef, which seems unlikely. There seems to be no explanation for this other than smaller tenders producers would have to book in their cattle and seek to get them in at a lower price in order to keep the prices down. That is most unsatisfactory.  I have done everything I possibly can in this regard.  I met representatives of the farming organisations and the industry in the Department and I asked them to make full use of the intervention which they sought and to pass on the price increase to the producers.</P>
      <P>My predecessor faced a similar problem and in desperation he referred the matter to the competition authority, but it was not able to do anything more about the matter.  Representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Food who attend the beef management meeting are asked what is the cry in Ireland about poor prices and poor access to markets, given that when markets &mdash; if intervention can be called a market &mdash; are made available, they are not being availed of.  Our cattle herd is increasing.</P>
      <P>It now stands at virtually eight million head, which is an all-time record.  The argument is that if things are that bad why is the access available not being used and why are numbers increasing? I will continue to do everything I can.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of guff about live exports.  Some 129,000 head of cattle have been exported from Ireland this year to date.  That is four times more than last year.  The allegation is made from time to time that insufficient ferries or boats are available to carry them.  We have an adequate number of boats.  Any trader who approaches my Department with a boat which is up to standard and has adequate ventilation, feed and roll requirements has been approved.  Cattle have been taken mainly to mainland Europe &mdash; approximately 100,000 &mdash; while the rest have gone mainly to the Lebanon.  Every option open to me and my Department has been taken to help in the present situation and we will continue to operate on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its purpose is to increase the amount of grant-in-aid made payable to Bord Fáilte from £22 million to £50 million to support tourism capital development works.  Tourism is now our second biggest industry. It supports approximately 120,000 jobs, which represents one in 12 of the workforce.  When domestic tourism is taken into account the industry generates almost £3 billion annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has become a vital force in the economy. The industry is performing at a level of success unprecedented in its history.  Statistics indicate that for the first half of this year, the number of visitors to Ireland is well ahead of target by 11 <Col N="1107" /> per cent while revenue is up by 13 per cent, which is better than international and European averages.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement has opened up dramatic new horizons and has presented new opportunities to market the island as a whole. The prospect of a lasting and just peace offers exciting and new opportunities to attract a new wave of international tourists who, to date, would not have considered visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>The number of overseas visitors to Ireland has doubled over the past decade, from 2.4 million to 5.2 million.  Foreign earnings revenue has trebled from £800 million to £2.1 billion and employment in the industry has doubled from 60,000 to 120,000.  The continued promotion of a good regional spread and extension of the tourism season are vital elements in our tourism policy.  I congratulate Bord Fáilte &mdash; I wish its new chief executive every success &mdash; for the professional and efficient way in which it markets and advertises the country overseas.</P>
    <P>Local and regional marketing is of vital importance, especially in parts of the Dublin region.  In many cases there is a lack of information, which has been pointed out by Bord Fáilte, including inadequate sign posting.  In my constituency of Dublin North-East there are many places of historical interest and some of the best leisure facilities in the country.  For example, the peninsula of Howth and Bull Island are surrounded by natural beauty.  Howth has an old village atmosphere and breathtaking views.  It does not have the place on the map it deserves.  We should look at these issues and be more focused on local tourism amenities of this kind.  Many voluntary organisations are to be congratulated for the work they have done in villages throughout Ireland, in rural and urban areas, to promote their own locality as tourism attractions.</P>
    <P>It is vital we have a wide range of good quality transport accessible at a good price throughout the year.  The considerable expansion in access has been one of the most important drivers of tourism growth in recent years.  Tourism provides Ireland with a total revenue of £2.8 billion of which £2.1 billion is accounted for by out of State tourists.  This significant increase has been accompanied by a welcome increase in the quality and range of access transport options available. There are now direct routes throughout the year to many of our overseas markets.  However, given the rapid increase in traffic, it is difficult to fulfil the demand for facilities at some of the points of entry.</P>
    <P>Although the bulk of tourists use cars as their main form of transport, public transport plays a vital role.  Scheduled air capacity to and from Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports increased by 70 per cent in the period 1993-7 while Irish sea routes increased by between 15 and 20 per cent with car capacity increasing at a faster rate. However, capacity on sea routes from mainland Europe has declined despite the increase in <Col N="1108" /> capacity in the lower fare routes, which have resulted from increased competition.  It is very important, therefore, that our agents selling the country overseas are made aware that the impression that Ireland may be expensive and a difficult destination to reach is not true, although there are still improvements to be made with regard to access from certain countries, such as Spain and Canada.</P>
    <P>The country has much going for it, with top class hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, leisure facilities, fresh water angling, sea angling and so on.  We must be able to reassure potential visitors that a good quality reliable public transport system exists throughout the county, which will enable them to travel with ease from their point of entry to their destination, whether it be one of the major towns or cities or a more remote rural area. Overseas agents need to be able to provide clients with correct timetables, reservations and a knowledge of how the public transport system operates in Ireland.  On a seasonal basis good year round access transport will help increase tourism performance in the off-peak seasons and encourage other sectors such as conference incentive traffic, which is lacking, particularly in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>Direct access to regional airports is also important to achieve our goal of improving tourism performance in all regions.  I acknowledge the excellent services provided by both Irish and foreign air and sea carriers which have a very beneficial impact.</P>
    <P>Scheduled bus transport is the most frequently used form of public transport by almost a quarter of overseas tourists.  One million overseas tourists use scheduled bus services annually, with half a million using rail.  Mainland Europeans are the most likely of all our overseas tourists to use public transport while in Ireland, with one-third of them using bus services, a vital component that we must get right.  We must not become complacent because tourism is at an all time high.  We have new customers, and we must make them old customers.  That is the name of the game in business. The public transport system is a vital component. I am delighted that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has given a commitment to make the necessary funding available to improve the public transport system.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Roche, if that is in order.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has made a valuable input into the tourism industry in an indirect way.</P>
    <P>In Dublin particularly, litter was a major problem. If one drove through Dublin's north side one would see litter all over the place, a very bad image from the point of view of a tourist.  The Minister of State has made a substantial amount of finance available to all the local authorities to set up programmes to create an awareness of litter, and that is to be welcomed.  I thank the local authorities, Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council, for the amenities they provide, the parks department in particular.  I also thank <Col N="1109" /> Dublin's City Manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, who has played a major role in making Dublin a better place for all.  One of the biggest projects ever to be undertaken in Europe, the Dublin Bay Project, is due to commence very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the previous speaker for his generosity in sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill and the idea of increasing the capital development fund which is available to Bord Fáilte.  We accept, on all sides of this House, that Bord Fáilte has done trojan work over the years in the promotion and development of tourism.</P>
      <P>Tourism is a rapidly growing industry.  It is an industry which is ideally suited in many ways to Ireland.  For a long time in the 1960s and 1970s tourism was principally sun-worshipping tourism, and we do not get much sun here.  However, times have changed.  Tourists are more sophisticated. They are looking for different types of products. To be fair to Bord Fáilte and to SFADCo, both organisations have been extraordinarily adept at developing new products and at selling Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>I have only one small problem with the Bill, and that is the wisdom of placing a ceiling on the capital available to the board.  It has always struck me as a particularly inflexible mechanism, and at regular intervals Ministers and various State boards find themselves in difficulties.  If it is right and proper to entrust whole areas of administration to autonomous or quasi-autonomous boards, the best we can do is give them a mission and the capital to fulfil that mission, and let them get on with the task.  The approach we are adopting here &mdash; which is no fault of this Minister &mdash; has been adopted since 1926 when the first tourism boards were set up but is nonetheless an inflexible mechanism.  Now that we have developed very sophisticated systems of accounting and management control, we could consider moving away from that approach.  Having said that, I give the Bill an absolute welcome.  The general direction the Minister is taking in this Bill is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I become a little parochial at this stage.  Since the Bill itself is slight, one needs to pick on a couple of topics on which to dwell.  There are a couple of topics on which I wish to dwell.</P>
      <P>Wicklow, the constituency that I have the great honour of serving in this House, is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary places in Ireland. It has a quite remarkable array of scenery and a quite remarkable history.  For some reason which is very difficult to discover, Wicklow has never really managed to capitalise fully on its extraordinarily unique location, on its unique people and on its unique history.  One of the problems has been its proximity to Dublin.  There is a need to invest very heavily in certain kinds of capital infrastructure in tourism in County Wicklow if the full potential of the county is to be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is aware that over the past number of years, going back to when I was <Col N="1110" /> spokesman on Finance in Seanad Éireann, I have been pressing all Ministers for Finance for an urgent review of the decision to exclude the town of Bray from the seaside resort scheme.  The seaside resort scheme is effectively terminated but there is a review under way.  I believe a new scheme of some form will come forward in its place in the fullness of time.  It strikes me that the unique character of a town such as Bray, and particularly its seafront area, deserves to be recognised.  The seafront in Bray has been allowed to go into decline over the past 20 or 30 years.  It is shabby and in need of a capital injection. I know from talking to business people who operate along that seafront that they would be quite willing to change the businesses that they are in.  They would be more than anxious to bring in new, quality businesses to operate.  Certainly the whole seafront area could do with a major capital injection, and that should come in the form of high quality hotel and tourist accommodation. However, that product needs to be supported because we suffer in Bray from our close proximity to Dublin.  Currently the major development of hotels in Dublin is inimical to the development of similar projects in Bray.  A few years ago, when Deputy Ruairí Quinn was Minister for Finance, we discussed this at length.  He shared many of my views on Bray.  He took the view, and it was in his departmental brief, that economic pressure would effectively drive hotel development out and towards north Wicklow. That has not happened yet, and it will not happen unless we get some sort of capital for it.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to deal with is the general issue of the capital allowances for hotel investment.  Given the deficiency in County Wicklow in this area, I felt very strongly last year that Wicklow should not have been excluded from the capital allowances arrangements which were introduced in the budget.  I can understand well why the Border counties and the less developed counties in the west were favourably looked on in this, and I do not suggest that it should have been otherwise.  However, if one compares the amount of four-star hotel accommodation in County Donegal with the amount in Wicklow, Wicklow comes off a very poor second, yet we are not included in any of the schemes.  What I am suggesting to the Minister, and through the Minister to the Minister for Finance, is that in the fullness of time a little equity should be visited on places like Wicklow which suffer from peripherality to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The third issue, an interest which I share with the Minister, is the issue of swimming.  It seems that swimming as a sport and recreational activity is in a limbo here.  It seems quite extraordinary that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has to scramble for funding for a basic sport, a sport which should be developed.  For example, there are two swimming pool projects in County Wicklow at present, one in Arklow and the other in Wicklow town.  It has taken an interminable amount of time to bring these on <Col N="1111" /> stream.  Local collections were held but because of the passage of time, additional resources will be sought from hard pressed local communities. This piece of public business is being done in an entirely wrong way.  The manner in which swimming has been dealt with under the sports and recreational portfolios is wrong headed.  There is a need for clarity on this issue and to speed up procedural arrangements to ensure there are not, as in Arklow and Wicklow, interminable delays and undoubted escalations of cost.</P>
    <P>Regarding the development of new tourism products, Ireland will never be a sun location. This is probably for the best given the damage sun holidays have done to people over the years.</P>
    <P>It constantly occurs to me as I travel around County Wicklow that there is an abundance of interesting old buildings.  For example, in Rathdrum, an extraordinary stone building is lying idle.  There are also buildings in a similar condition in Glendalough and Laragh.  We should be able to bring these into play and develop new tourism products in them.</P>
    <P>Given the condition of the buildings and because some of them are listed, it is difficult to do anything with them.  There is a need for a creative taxation device which would encourage the development of old heritage buildings.  They do not have to be large buildings.  Across south Wicklow, there are some fabulous stone buildings, such as outhouses and farmhouses, which are not in full use or which are being used as dumping grounds.  If there was ever an asset crying out for development, it is these old heritage buildings.  They could be upgraded and brought into use.  They could become a valuable asset for local communities and a valuable tourism product if a programme similar to the Gites scheme which operates in France was introduced.  We could fund and assist such a scheme through taxation revenue.</P>
    <P>Physical buildings are only one aspect of heritage. Counties such as Wicklow are rich in heritage. The old jail in Wicklow town has recently been renovated under the auspices of the county council.  Due to the foresight of our county manager, Mr. Treacy, the jail has been brought into use as a tourism amenity.  More interestingly, a new heritage centre has been created in the jail to try to make connections with some of the Irish diaspora, particularly the people who went to Australia after 1798.</P>
    <P>Another interesting old building is the fortified barracks which was built at the end of Military Road at Aghavannagh.  It is for sale but An Óige does not have the resources to develop it.  As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the rebellion, it is a pity that a fund is not available to public authorities, such as Bord Fáilte and local authorities, to restore heritage buildings and put them to their best use.</P>
    <P>A debate is ongoing about another heritage item, the Asgard.  This sailing vessel served the nation extremely well.  I hope it will be treated as <Col N="1112" /> a very valuable national historical artefact.  A good case could be made for making a replica of the Asgard, but not from it.  I call on the various Ministers involved to examine this issue and to sympathetically consider relocating this fine piece of historical heritage to Wicklow jail.  There is an adequate amount of space available for it.  There is also a marvellous connection with the patriot Erskine Childers because he spent the first night of his imprisonment before his execution in Wicklow jail.  He was also reared in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>There is huge potential in tourism in Ireland. One does not have to strain one's imagination to come up with new tourism products.  I commend the Bill and I compliment the Minister on his fine work to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Allen.</P>
      <P>It has been repeatedly stated during the debate that we are killing the golden goose.  Tourism has the potential to be self-destructive.  One only needs to consider the Acropolis in Greece, Pompeii or Venice where there are huge numbers of tourists.  This is off-putting and appalling, but it is not only the volume of tourists that is causing destruction.  People are taking pieces of the Acropolis and Pompeii away with them and there is a danger that something similar will happen in Ireland.  For example, one cannot move around Slea Head on a good summer's day.</P>
      <P>There should be sustainable tourism.  If tourism is not sustainable, the golden goose will be killed. Only public transport or bicycles should be used in sensitive areas with narrow roads.  Deputy Roche mentioned potential.  There is huge potential in Ireland for cycling holidays.  We should consider this end of the market because we cannot compete on the mass market of sun holidays. We do not want to do so anyway, but we can compete in the quality end of the market and there are a number of areas in which our act can be improved.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to work for a week as a tour guide and it was an eye opener.  Deputy Roche mentioned old stone buildings.  One of the aspects which struck me immediately was the number of buildings in Ireland which we cannot identify.  I was not in a position to identify buildings about which tourists asked.  We take these buildings for granted.  To us, they are old ruins. We have not sufficiently tapped into the huge potential of archaeological tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to litter.  We must invest heavily, as they do in other countries, to deal with this problem.  It is not only the Tutonic consciousness of the Germans which enables them to have clean streets.  They invest hugely in litter prevention. They have many more people cleaning the streets than we do in Dublin.  A similar position exists in Paris.  The litter problem could be improved by the introduction of a green tax on packaging.  This tax should be hypothecated to litter prevention.  A committee is considering green <Col N="1113" /> taxation but this issue has not been addressed.  It is sitting back and not dealing properly with it.</P>
    <P>Tourists often comment on the issue of pollution. Ireland has a reputation as a clean, green island.  Yet, we have serious problems with regard to water pollution.  It is great if people are attracted for specialist holidays, such as angling. However, they soon discover that many areas, including the Killarney lakes, the River Shannon and Lough Derg, are suffering pollution from nutrients.  We have not tackled the problem with nutrient management plans and taxes on phosphates which are causing so much damage.  This issue is interlinked.  We cannot separate tourism from the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Overcharging was mentioned earlier.  Ireland is the country of the welcomes, but it is also Ireland of the rip-offs.  It is unfortunate that tourists constantly complain about overpricing.  When I was in Killarney during the summer I wanted to buy a map of the area.  The price in the supermarket was £3, but the price of the same map in a Bord Fáilte office was £4.50. If Bord Fáilte over-charges, it gives a signal that tourists are fair game.  They are being bled dry with the result that many will not return.  Deputy Deasy said there was a need for a special telephone line.  The Minister should intervene as it is a growing problem.</P>
    <P>In terms of scenery the Minister's county of Donegal has a better product than Deputy Allen's county of Cork but what they have managed to do in Cork is generate a food culture.  It has fantastic restaurants in which one will not be served instant coffee.  One is served good quality food and coffee every time.  This draws continentals in particular towards Cork.  There are only a few high quality restaurants in Donegal, including Kealy's in Greencastle.  This is an area that will have to be looked at if we are to attract more tourists.  We have good organic farms and can produce good quality food.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche was parochial in referring to Wicklow.  I wish to refer to Dublin, particularly the part that I represent.  More young people want to come to the city which is seen abroad as a vibrant place.  It is also cheap to get here.  Dublin is situated in a beautiful bay which, as a result of the provision of a state of the art tertiary treatment plant in Ringsend, will be clean and pristine. The people of Ringsend, however, have had enough.  They are being offered nothing in return for accepting all of Dublin's sewage.  Unlike Dollymount, the beach in Sandymount will not have a blue flag.  There should be a cycle route around the bay while people should be able to swim at the beaches dotted around it &mdash; one can swim at the Forty Foot in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; to entice visitors to remain in the city for a few days for the scenery as well as the craic.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion in Dublin is a huge drawback, it is a problem on which visitors have commented. It is so bad that conference delegates now travel from the airport to locations such as Seán Moore Park in Irishtown by helicopter.  It <Col N="1114" /> takes up to one and a half hours to travel across the city.  One can travel more quickly from Dublin to London.  This makes the city less competitive and less attractive.</P>
    <P>There is a need for huge investment in public transport.  This brings us back to the question of taxation.  A system of road pricing has been introduced in Edinburgh.  The money raised is invested in public transport infrastructure.  Some 71 per cent of people in Britain have said that they would opt for such a system.  A good public transport system &mdash; the taxi issue is also being dealt with &mdash; would make Dublin a more attractive destination.</P>
    <P>Our independent hostels are a wonderful success story.  They provide good and cheap accommodation. I hope the young adults who use them will return and spend huge amounts of money.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a room tax should be introduced in Dublin to maintain the city's tourism infrastructure.  This is a controversial proposal but one which should be explored.  It has also been suggested that a landing fee should be introduced at Kilronan pier on the Aran Islands. This should also be explored.  Many people travel to the islands on day trips from Galway city which means that the islanders are getting the tourists but not the money.  The same is true in Dublin. While Dublin Corporation is doing its best to provide infrastructure, it is not a net beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Sustainable tourism needs to be looked at.  If we do not pursue the quality end of the market, we may destroy our tourism market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many issues have been raised during the debate which has spanned a number of weeks, some of which can be fleshed out on Committee Stage.  While tourism is experiencing unprecedented growth, there is an imbalance in the figures throughout the country.  The industry generated revenue of £2.8 billion in 1997 when we attracted more than five million overseas visitors who accounted for £2.1 billion of foreign earnings. The industry sustains about 175,000 jobs. For each additional £1 million spent by foreign tourists 41 new jobs are created.  The Government benefited to the tune of more than £1.1 billion or 45p for each pound spent by tourists.</P>
      <P>Globally, tourism is expected to grow by between 3 and 4 per cent between the years 1998 and 2000 and by about 4.5 per cent between the years 2000 and 2005.  A growth rate of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent is predicted here.  The role tourism is playing in the economy is not fully realised.  The industry has to develop in the context of the many changes taking place in society. While the Minister has announced fancy figures, the season in parts of Kerry and west Cork as well as the north-west has been described as poor to patchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed to win further substantial European funding for the ongoing development of the tourism industry.  I detect a defeatist attitude.  We seem to be accepting the line that the country has developed to the point <Col N="1115" /> where we cannot expect to attract the same level of funding.  Tourism is an exception.  Compared to other countries our infrastructure is not of the standard required by the modern day tourist.  This accounts for the imbalance in tourism growth rates.  It should be a key objective that one should be able to travel to any part of the country from an airport or seaport within two and a half hours. Air, ferry, rail and road links to the regions have to be improved.</P>
    <P>All local agencies and trade bodies must be involved in developing a tourism policy and new tourism centres.  Niche market developments and rural tourism must be looked at more than they have been to date in terms of golfing, fishing and international festivals.  We must set up a number of new regional complexes to attract people into the regions and, of course, there is a need to enhance tourism in the Border area, which is close to the Minister's heart.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development must also be addressed sooner rather than later, otherwise the industry will overheat as it has in Dublin, Killarney and Galway.  However, there is poor and patchy growth outside those areas.  In order to sustain development and achieve uniform growth throughout the country a number of issues must be tackled, and I will discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with three issues.  The Minister was unavoidably absent on Tuesday when I raised the issue of the national conference centre.  The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, replied that tax break problems may be experienced in the development of the Dublin docklands.  I did not get the answer I was looking for and I want the Minister to address this issue sooner rather than later.  There are reports of a row between the company developing the conference centre and the State body charged with redeveloping Dublin docks and there are fears that the project may not go ahead if the dispute remains unresolved.</P>
    <P>For example, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> reported this week that the Spencer Dock Development Company may not proceed with the project unless the planning dispute with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is resolved quickly.  A spokesman for the SDC, Mr. Barrett, said the company would be submitting complaints to the Minister for Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts about the DDDA's handling of the issue.  The complaints were made and the spokesman also said that the future of the centre was in serious jeopardy because the authority had refused to confirm that it would not object to the planning permission for site preparation, which was granted by Dublin Corporation last month.  He went on to describe the situation as &ldquo;completely disastrous&rdquo; and said that no one could do business with the authority, which was impeding development in the docklands when it was supposed to be facilitating it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> A further allegation made by the company was that the authority had asked for a £50 million payment in return for a speedy approval of the planning permission for the conference centre. Mr. Barrett said that if the situation was not resolved and an objection was lodged, a further four months delay could elapse before a decision on the site works appeal is given.  If the delay happens it will be disastrous because the £25 million funding available from the EU may be lost and that would sound the death knell for this project, given that the centre must be completed by December 2000 to qualify for funding.</P>
    <P>The dispute between the development company and the authority is one issue but the threat from the European Commission to block tax concessions is another.  There are also suggestions that senior civil servants in the Department of Finance are unconvinced that the project is viable.  Will the Minister assure the House that he is taking a hands on approach to this important matter and that he will invite the different parties into his Department to ensure that no fatal delays will occur in the development of the project?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's statement at the premiere of &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo; earlier this week in New York.  He announced a merger between the tourism authorities on this island in line with the British-Irish Agreement.  Will the Minister outline his thoughts on that merger? Perhaps he will provide the House with more detail on the proposals.  I hope that any proposed merger will take place with total co-operation with our neighbours in Northern Ireland and there will not be a repeat of the shamrock logo fiasco.  Will legislation be required to bring about the merger?  Where will the merged authority be located?</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley referred to the room tax and the tax proposed for the Aran Islands.  These proposals have come about because of uncertainty about European funding and tourism development in the years ahead.  These taxes will replace funding that is not forthcoming because of defects in the financing of local government.  Those issues are matters for local government.  The Minister should clarify that he is totally against these proposals, otherwise there will be access taxes to Sherkin Island and Cape Clear in my own county and the Ring of Kerry, for example.  The marketing for next year's tourist season is ongoing and reports are appearing in the <i>Irish Post</i> and other newspapers which are seriously damaging our marketing initiatives abroad.  The Minister should provide political leadership and say that he will totally oppose the principle of further taxes on tourism.  The financing of local government is a matter for the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government and it is not a matter for us to load tourists with the cost of developing our infrastructure.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Belton.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well in his work, given the rapid development of the tourism industry, for which there are many reasons. However, only certain areas have benefited from the tourism boom.  The midlands region has not benefited to the same extent as the east coast and other traditional tourist areas.  That cannot be taken away but there is an opportunity to encourage and increase funding for areas such as the midlands and the Shannon region and highlight their attractiveness.  There is no doubt that there are attractions in these areas.  A number of weeks ago I referred to establishing county tourism committees, but the Minister said that he did not want to take on another tier of committees which he might have to fund.  However, I ask him to consider them again for areas such as I have mentioned. The Minister makes a valid point that the private sector has funded tourism committees in certain counties.  There is nothing wrong with this and it is to be admired.  However, it is difficult for people to set up a committee and promote an area when the private sector has not been engaged in this business for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Minister can only use the funding made available to him.  However, he should look again at the county committees.  Recognition should be given to the many people directly involved in this business, and those involved on a voluntary basis who are prepared to promote their own areas and counties.  There is not much point in having tourism committees if they do not have the necessary funding.  Everyone wants funding and expects the Government to support their initiatives. However, the Minister should look seriously at this situation.  Each county should be actively involved in its own promotion, in co-ordination with regional tourism boards.  We must acknowledge the work of the regional boards in promoting Ireland.  I wish the Minister well.  This is a good time for tourism and I hope that climate continues.  This is an opportune time to promote the whole of Ireland.  The east coast, particularly Dublin, has taken a huge number of visitors.  I thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible to address all the issues raised by Deputies.  However, while I will discuss this issue on Committee Stage, there will also be statements in the Seanad on this issue which I will use to try to comment on all the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to clarify my comments in New York on the merger of the two tourism bodies.  I want to offer every possible olive branch to our colleagues in the North.  I met members of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in New York and we discussed tourism and how it is benefiting the North and the South.  Much consensus has been <Col N="1118" /> reached at official level.  We both agree that there is much sense in marketing the island as a whole. I assure the Northern Ireland Tourist Board that it will not find my Department wanting if there is any possibility of future developments on how both parts of the island can benefit.  Perhaps the Northern Ireland Tourist Board sees a role for itself in specific matters.  I have no objections to that and Bord Fáilte will also have its own specific role.  However, we can all benefit from marketing.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming into the House.  He will recall a visit we made to Baghdad before the Gulf War.  We are familiar with the region.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue on the Adjournment because I feel that we are inexorably and silently slipping towards acceptance of a military solution to the Iraqi problem.  Within the few minutes available I have to be economic with what I can say.</P>
      <P>Lest there be the slightest misconstruction, I have always condemned Saddam Hussein's actions, even before the Gulf War when he used mustard gas against the Kurds.  However, I am not satisfied that the non-military options have been exhausted.  For example, the decision by the head of UNSCOM, Richard Butler, to withdraw personnel from Iraq was taken after a telephone call informing Kofi Annan and at the request of the United States.  The UN is a representative body of the family of nations and is responsible to all nations.  All Irish Governments have stressed non-military solutions and the importance of exhausting diplomatic solutions to conflicts, even to the point of tedium if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish parliamentarians who recently visited Iraq confirmed what we had suspected.  Namely, that the Iraqi people, particularly civilians, children and those suffering from illnesses, including cancers, have been paying an enormous price for the war.  I have been struck by the inappropriateness and crudeness of the mechanism which allowed Iraq to export oil under the famous oil for food aid agreement.  Irish people do not necessarily know that from the revenue Iraq earns from these exports, it must deduct payment for the war, payment to companies who lost business during the war, and other commercial fines, before it can be <Col N="1119" /> used on humanitarian expenditure.  As a result, some have suggested that only 40 cents out of every dollar is available for humanitarian aid expenditure.</P>
    <P>On 29 October, I tabled a parliamentary question asking the Minister to make a statement regarding the circumstances which led to the recent resignation of the UN co-ordinator for humanitarian relief in Iraq.  On another occasion I asked him to make a statement on the general situation in Iraq.  I accept that he cannot comment in detail on the situation regarding the humanitarian co-ordinator and the UN.  However, this raises an issue.  What was unsaid in my question and not addressed in the Minister's answer, was that the co-ordinator was frustrated at the impossibility of delivering humanitarian relief in the most terrible conditions to those who did not initiate the conflict &mdash; ordinary civilians, women, children and those suffering illnesses.  He more or less threw in the towel.</P>
    <P>I believe we are witnessing a certain kind of macho insistence on utter compliance which is somewhat one-sided.  It is difficult for me to say this, but I have a moral obligation to do so; this situation could be more easily resolved if it was known where the goal posts are to be.  Are the goalposts to be changed and what is the end point of inspection?  Is there a point at which relief can flow and exports can resume?  The international community seemed to receive some evidence that if a definite end point or three month period were specified, both parties could reach agreement.  I , the Minister and others are implacably opposed to war as a solution.  We want to see a greater effort made, even at this late stage, to avert that through the methods to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Higgins for raising this matter which is one of deep and mounting concern for the Government.  The origins of the current crisis lie in the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council in 1991 to deal with the threat to international peace posed by the weapons of mass destruction possessed by the Iraqi Government in the nuclear, chemical and biological areas.</P>
      <P>Through Resolution 687 of April 1991, the council authorised the setting up of a special UN Commission, UNSCOM, to oversee the disarmament and destruction of these weapons.  The resolution also provides for lifting the sanctions which were imposed by the Security Council following the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, once the Security Council has been satisfied that the question of the payment by Iraq of compensation on foot of the war has been addressed and the disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction has been verified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While much work has been done in the nuclear area, marked reluctance by Iraq to comply with the terms of Resolution 687, as well as the other resolutions passed by the Security Council, has <Col N="1120" /> led to a series of escalating crises between Iraq and the council.  Earlier this year, the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, diffused the most serious of these situations, until the present one, when he reached an agreement with the Iraqi Government which resulted in UNSCOM continuing its work subject to certain changes in the modalities of its inspections. Shortly after that, the Security Council, in Resolution 1154, stressed that any violation of this agreement, or the previous UN resolutions relating to the destruction of Iraq's inventory of such weapons, &ldquo;would have the severest consequences for Iraq&rdquo;.  Regular inspections by UNSCOM were resumed after that for a period of several months.</P>
    <P>On 5 August, Iraq announced it had decided to suspend co-operation with UNSCOM again.  On 9 September, the Security Council agreed to Resolution 1191 which condemned this decision by Iraq.  The council called on Iraq to rescind that decision and announced that it would not now conduct a comprehensive review of the sanctions regime established by the UN Security Council which was scheduled for October 1998 until that decision was formally rescinded.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General has joined his voice to that of the council in relation to other resolutions, more particularly those of 30 October and 5 November, Resolution 1205.  Yesterday, he issued a statement strongly urging the leader and Government of Iraq to rescind the decision and resume immediate co-operation with the disarmament inspectors.  He indicated his understanding for the wish of the Iraqi Government to have the Security Council sanctions lifted but pointed out that the only way to achieve this was for Iraq to co-operate fully with the council.  He believed the comprehensive review of the sanctions agreed by the council offered Iraq a genuine opportunity and, provided Iraq co-operates, would allow them to see light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The situation in Iraq was again addressed by the EU General Affairs Council which I attended on 9 November.  In a statement issued after its deliberations, the council condemned Iraq's decision of 31 October as totally unacceptable and stated that the EU supported the terms of the Security Council resolution of 5 November.</P>
    <P>In addition to the question of neutralising Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Deputy Higgins properly pointed out that there is also a humanitarian dimension to the current crisis.  It is clear the sanctions are having a very serious effect on the welfare of the Iraqi people, in particular, of Iraqi women and children.  The international community has demonstrated its concern at this. In 1995, the Security Council passed Resolution 986 initiating a food for aid programme, under which Iraq was permitted to export certain quantities of oil and to use the income so earned to pay for food and medical supplies.  These supplies were to be distributed under UN supervision.  In February of this year, after the Secretary General had reached the agreement with the Iraqi Government, the council doubled the value of the <Col N="1121" /> oil which Iraq was permitted to export to $5.2 billion every six months.</P>
    <P>In a report to the Security Council in September, the UN Secretary General estimated that oil revenues for the period 30 May to 25 November could be as high as $3.3 billion.  This would provide $2.178 billion for the humanitarian programme, which is still $1 billion less than needed to fully fund the enhanced distribution plan approved by the Secretary General last May and shows that much work still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on the overall situation is quite clear.  We fully support the Security Council in demanding full compliance by the Government of Iraq with the terms of its resolutions and we call on it to reconsider its position. Its compliance with these resolutions will make it possible for the entire issue of sanctions against Iraq to be addressed.  I have noted the media reports regarding the possible use of force to get the Iraqi leadership to resume compliance with its obligations and I am entirely in agreement with the Deputy's views on that.  It is clear that both the US and the UK are determined to exert the strongest possible pressure on Iraq to comply with the Security Council resolutions.  The Security Council is now actively seized of this issue and held a meeting on the subject yesterday.  It is the responsibility of the current members of the council to assess the extent of Iraq's failure to respond to the council's demands and the action that may be needed under the relevant provision of the Charter in order to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the UN has a definite role to play in the current crisis.  Mr. Annan has interrupted his tour of North Africa and returned to New York where he will be in a position to assess how best he can contribute to a resolution of the current crisis.  All opportunities for dialogue and all efforts to avoid the use of force must be fully explored.  The Government is following the crisis closely and will keep the House informed of developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Ms Fox Ms Fox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this matter which I have attempted to raise for some time.  The ongoing TB problem in Wicklow has reached emergency levels in farming communities in the east and west of the county.  It seems to have many strands, each of which are causing problems in their own right.  TB levels in west Wicklow have been alarmingly high for some time now, but east Wicklow has not experienced the levels of TB it is currently experiencing for many years.  Herd after herd has gone down with the disease, particularly in the Roundwood, Newtownmountkennedy, Kilcoole and Enniskerry areas and many others have gone down in the south of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The east Wicklow area was almost disease free until a few months ago when a number of herds tested positively in the Roundwood area.  Some of these herds were eventually depopulated and <Col N="1122" /> farmers are now beginning to restock.  There is no point in these farmers restocking when no real effort has been made to source the cause of the infection and eradicate it.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case where a farmer is currently restocking, having been depopulated six months ago.  Neighbours on both sides of him have cattle infected with TB and common sense would seem to indicate he is walking into a minefield. One of his neighbours had six reactors and subsequently discovered that two further animals, which had cleared the test, showed lesions.  This reveals a huge flaw in the testing system and is evidence that the skin test system is very unreliable. Another neighbour has had reactors on his farm for the past four months &mdash; he is awaiting settlement of a dispute over possession of the animals. His cattle have not been tested in the past four or five months and should be tested now to establish how many animals are involved.</P>
    <P>I question whether permits should be issued to take reactors off farms prior to any effort being made by the Department to take possession of the animals on the Minister's behalf.  The farmer to whom I have referred has communicated with the Department on a number of occasions stating he is agreeable to the Minister removing the infected animals under the authority of law.  The option of taking possession seems to be constantly by-passed because it is an easier route to issue permits.</P>
    <P>Farmers are also very unhappy with the performance of the eradication scheme in this area. Bureaucracy and the numbers of officials employed have reached untold levels, yet the problem seems to be getting worse and worse.  On the ground it is felt it has turned into big business and frustration is rapidly growing.  Panic is beginning to set in in some areas.  In the context of livelihoods we can sympathise with their frustration.</P>
    <P>Another strand to the problem is the fact that infection is being spread freely in the area. Infected wildlife is causing a TB epidemic in County Wicklow, a fact accepted even by the local DVO.  On the ground little or nothing is being done to combat the problem.  Deer are allowed to wander freely around the area.  They eat from round feeders on farms and many mornings are found grazing freely on farmers' private land.  The deer population has increased up to four times in the Wicklow uplands.  Testing of the deer, if there has been any, has been minuscule. It would be very unwise to continue in this vein. The Department of Agriculture and Food must test a substantial number of deer to see exactly the extent of the problem.  The only move which has been made in this regard is to allow a worker from Coillte to shoot deer on certain infected lands.  However, this is not the person's full-time job.  There has been a wink and nod suggestion to farmers that they shoot deer on their land on sight.  Unfortunately, not too many farmers in east Wicklow have the correct calibre of gun or permit required to shoot deer.  There is a clear <Col N="1123" /> need for more co-operation between the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which should come together, source the carriers of this terrible disease and eradicate it.</P>
    <P>In Kilcoole the common denominator seems to be the badger.  There is also a national protected area nearby where badgers are allowed wander freely on the land.  I am not aware if any of these badgers have been tested or, if so, what the results have been.  Scientific research in County Offaly has proved that the removal of badgers on a large area reduces the incidence of TB reactors to approximately 0.04 APT.  I impress upon the Minister that it is time for such a scheme in east Wicklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising a matter which is of concern to the farming community in County Wicklow and generally.  As the Deputy is from a farming background, her interest comes from a practical knowledge of how a disease breakdown can severely disrupt the operation of farm businesses and I agree fully with everything she said.</P>
      <P>In recent years the incidence of bovine TB as measured by the number of reactors disclosed per 1,000 animals tested has been decreasing.  Currently, however, there is an increase in infection levels.  I also understand that the level of bovine TB is also increasing in Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to identify the factors contributing to the problem.  My veterinary officials are, <i>inter alia</i>, in discussion with their counterparts in other jurisdictions with a view to determining whether a common causative factor exists.  Research in bovine TB continues at my Department's dedicated tuberculosis investigation unit and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The incidence of TB has also increased in County Wicklow this year and a special testing programme is under way in the course of which virtually all herds in the east of the county will have been screened twice during 1998.  In addition, a wildlife investigation programme is in place to determine the extent to which badgers and deer have TB lesions on post mortem.  I listened very attentively to the issue concerning deer.  I agree with the Deputy and am aware of the problems they are creating.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is in ongoing consultation with the interested organisations at local level and nationally in the animal health forum.  My officials are also in discussion with Dúchas as regards the potential implications of infection in the wild deer population should samples currently being sent for laboratory analysis show a significant lesion level.  I am advised that some infection has been detected in examinations undertaken so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The servicing of badger snaring licences has commenced.  Results of Wicklow post mortems to <Col N="1124" /> date have shown a positive TB rate of 7.3 per cent which is not unduly high by national standards. Further work is under way in this respect.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the situation in County Wicklow is under close examination with a view to turning the situation around as quickly as is feasible.  While the current situation is naturally a cause for concern, overall the position remains that we have a good health status with some 99 per cent of the country's cattle being clear of the disease.</P>
    <P>I invite the Deputy to meet with my officials next week so that she can further outline to them her concerns.  I am aware of the difficulties and the high costs to farmers and the State, which the Estimates show is £43 million.  It is very commendable that the Deputy has raised the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling on the Government to put in place a national strategy to deal with the crisis in child care.  There is a crisis in the provision of child care places at present.  We need a child care plan, Structural Funds devoted to the issue, action on day care, action to encourage employers to support parents who are combining work and family life, initiatives to ensure we have proper training for those who are looking after children and initiatives to ensure there is proper monitoring of day care services that are developing.</P>
      <P>The crisis concerns both the provision of places and the monitoring and inspection of day care places.  This must be set against the background of a serious problem of child poverty.  It is extraordinary that in this time of the Celtic tiger we have the second highest national rate of child poverty in the EU.  Investing in our children should be a key priority.  It has never been a top priority at a public policy level, despite a great deal of lip service to families and children.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to services for children at risk, as well as those thousands of children who need quality day care, is now at a crossroads. Ireland has among the highest child care costs as a proportion of average earnings in the EU. Average costs in Ireland are 20 per cent of average earnings, while in other European countries it is 8 per cent.  Here parents pay a very high amount of their income in child care and they are not able to pay more.</P>
      <P>A new factor emerging in Ireland is the huge growth in participation by women in the labour force. The female labour force is projected to grow by 218,000, an increase of 37 per cent, between now and 2011.  There undoubtedly will be a dramatic increase in participation in the workforce by married women and mothers and it is absolutely clear that the demand for child care is going to increase dramatically, perhaps by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even without taking these figures into account there is an existing crisis in child care because the providers in the formal sector are not expanding despite ever increasing demands for places.  There <Col N="1125" /> are quite a number of problems facing this sector which must be addressed urgently.  There are difficulties in recruiting people to work in the sector, a shortage of places, particularly for very young children, very strict regulations which I welcome and a lack of part-time care available for parents. All this is putting huge pressure on the supply of child care services.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline to the House the current situation regarding the monitoring and inspection procedures which operate under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the 1996 regulations which deal with the supervision of pre-school services. How many premises have been inspected since the regulations began to be enforced?  What is the finding of those inspections and that monitoring? Will the Minister indicate to the House what action plan he intends to take to help this sector deal with the severe problems which it currently faces?  It is very clear that high quality pre-school education can play a very important role in off-setting the effects of social disadvantage and in preventing school failure.</P>
    <P>The vital importance in this country of reconciling employment and family life must be recognised. The pattern of family life has changed very dramatically.  The Government must recognise this and take appropriate actions to deal with a changing situation.  Part of supporting the family is supporting quality child care.</P>
    <P>The child care issue is very complex and must take into account the needs of children, mothers who choose paid employment, those who stay at home, the needs of fathers and child care providers. Action is needed on all fronts.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before on this matter and have alluded to the fact that international research has shown that the three most important hallmarks of quality care to children in day care facilities are accommodation and equipment, personnel qualifications and the adult-child ratio.  There is a severe danger that, given the current shortages and the pressures on parents to find child care services, we will fail on all three of these in the services we supply.  A policy to promote the highest standards of quality day care nationally must be developed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate whether it is correct that up to half of registered pre-schools across the country still have not been inspected by regional health boards and that hundreds of other child care providers have also failed to register their centres and are ignoring the two year old Act? Nothing less is at stake than the physical and mental welfare of thousands upon thousands of children now and in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to the issues I have raised as I believe there is a crisis in child care services.  The march on Saturday is a very dramatic illustration of the crisis facing parents and providers.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this important issue on the <Col N="1126" /> Adjournment.  I am replying to the debate in the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  In 1998, a further £8 million revenue has been made available to strengthen child care services.  This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII, came into operation on 31 December 1996.  The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or propose to carry on a pre-school service.  On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.  The explanatory guide to the regulations covering the requirements and procedures for notification and inspection states:</P>
      <P>In view of the large numbers involved it is envisaged that health boards will have a two year period to complete the first inspection of pre-school services.  On this basis all pre-school services should be inspected by mid-1999. Inspections will take place annually thereafter.</P>
      <P>Pre-inspection teams are now in place in all health board areas and have started to inspect facilities on a phased basis.  In general, inspections are carried out on a prioritised basis to ensure that areas of concern to members of the public, the voluntary sector and the professional staff of the health boards are dealt with.  An inspection may take from two hours to two days.  The activities of the inspection teams include providing information to parents, providers and other interested persons and agencies.  It also involves advising the providers in relation to the requirements of the regulations to facilitate an overall improvement in the quality of child care services.</P>
      <P>The latest information available from the health boards shows that more than 2,500 notifications have been received by the health boards and approximately one-third of the facilities concerned have been inspected to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is in place.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a <Col N="1127" /> consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  As a first step in this process, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahy, recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of child care.  In this regard, an expert group on child care has been established under Partnership 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector.  The group, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is expected to finalise its report in December 1998.</P>

      <P>Despite the improvements of recent years, the Minister will be aware that breast cancer remains a significant killer of women in our society.  It has had a traumatic effect on many families over the years, including my own. My mother died some years ago following a mastectomy to treat breast cancer.  At the weekend we heard moving testimony from the distinguished journalist and broadcaster, Olivia O'Leary, at the publication of her book on the presidential career of Mary Robinson.  She recounted her own experience of this dreadful experience and stressed the urgent necessity of intervention for people suspected of having this disease.</P>
      <P>Last weekend at one of my information clinics, I met one of my constituents from the Kilbarrack area who was very distressed and tearful about his wife's health.  His wife had lumps in her breast and suspected the worst, and because of the family history she had had some tissue removed.  This woman's GP had been told by the Mater Hospital that the earliest possible appointment for a mammogram and treatment would be the end of January or early February.  Needless to say, this woman and her husband have been left in turmoil and they are terrified that over the coming three months their worst fears could be realised.</P>
      <P>I am aware there is a system in place whereby GPs conduct examinations of their patients, prioritise those requiring immediate treatment and refer them to hospitals.  These people do not have voluntary health insurance but there appears to be a <i>prima facie</i> case that this woman might not be treated in time with obviously disastrous consequences for herself and her family. Obviously I have sent a memo to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Taoiseach and the chief executive of the Mater Hospital requesting the earliest possible intervention in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we had a brouhaha, which the Chair eventually brought to a close, about the Health Estimates and the fact that there is a sum of £32 million in outstanding income that the <Col N="1128" /> Government apparently does not propose to spend this year and which, in the context of the case I have recounted, is outrageous.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this issue.</P>
    <P>On the overall macro-budgetary position, we received the Estimates yesterday from the Minister for Finance.  I cannot understand the logic of banking £1 billion at this stage of our development when, thanks to the NTMA, we have succeeded in reducing the debt to £28.5 billion.  That seems to be the straitjacket approach of the Department of Finance which is making predictions about the coming years when it has been wrong about previous predictions.</P>
    <P>I realise there are serious structural problems in relation to Irish medicine and treatment. Indeed, it has been estimated that we need an additional 700 consultants because our junior doctors continue to be hopelessly overworked. There is a crazy system in place whereby public contractors are using public facilities.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Cowen to address that problem.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers for Health, including Noel C. Browne and Barry Desmond, a former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, tried to reorganise the health care system but they came off second best.  An urgent reappraisal is needed and I urge the Minister, who had a reputation for being a tough Minister who took on everybody, to take on these vested interests in the health area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the period 1987-92, first under the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil alliance known as the Tallaght strategy and then under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, some people died on waiting lists because of the savage cutbacks at that time.  That era has long since passed, the money is flowing in and people expect us to spend it and benefit from the Celtic tiger.  If there is a single case of a major illness that needs to be treated as a matter of urgency, it is the job of the Minister and the Minister of State to organise that and not to condemn people to suffering and turmoil.  As the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, people will be in agony over Christmas waiting for test results. Their minds should be put at rest.  The Minister should grab the health service by the scruff of the neck and give the Irish people what a free, independent republic should have, not the skulking and semi-privatised fiasco we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.  I assure him that this £32 million sum is a phantom.  There is no such sum that has not or will not be spent this year on the health services.  That is an accountancy problem which has already been explained today.  The Deputy's leader knows accountancy and he should know from the Estimates where that money is.  It will be explained again to those who still have doubts later in the week.  There will be a supplementary budget as more money will be needed for all the services in the health area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Broughan has raised this <Col N="1129" /> issue and given me the opportunity of clarifying the situation regarding the provision of breast cancer screening services.  I wish to inform the Deputy that urgent appointments for screening are normally seen within a few days of referral. The criteria for urgent cases include the existence of a breast lump, previous family history of breast cancer or other high risk indicators.</P>
    <P>Routine or asymptomatic cases are dealt with as soon as possible, but they are subject to careful prioritisation.  In view of the demands placed on mammography services, some hospitals may refer asymptomatic women to their general practitioner for a further assessment of priority. Hospitals review their caseload regularly to ensure that women with an urgent cause for concern are seen without delay.  Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait for a mammogram, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children would like to assure the Deputy of his ongoing commitment to developing mammography services in line with the principles set out in the National Cancer Strategy.  The Regional Directors of Cancer Services in the various health boards are preparing proposals for the further development of services for the treatment of cancer, including breast cancer.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of mammography services the Department is proceeding with the introduction of a national breast screening programme aimed at detecting breast cancer in asymptomatic women.  Phase one of the programme <Col N="1130" /> comprises the Eastern, Midland and North Eastern Health Board areas.  A key determinant regarding the start-up date for the programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff.  This involves the appointment of two radiologists, four consultant radiologists, two surgeons, two histopathologists, one epidemiologist, 14 radiographers, two specialist breast care nurses, one physicist and the necessary administrative and support staff. Advertisements for these staff were recently placed in the national press and once the relevant staff are in place the programme will proceed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to making the necessary resources available to facilitate the commencement of screening and has approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start up costs and capital equipment.  In addition, the following capital allocations were recently approved: £1,035,000 towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street &mdash; the Mater Hospital &mdash; as a screening and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme; and £897,000 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsequent phases of the programme, the Minister will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase one of the programme in place.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a problem with one patient who has not heard from the Department, he should let us know and we will look into that case with a view to seeing if it can be prioritised.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 November 1998.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the study referred to.  I accept there is need for continuing emphasis on training for farmers and farm workers with respect to the safe use of pesticides.  In this connection, Teagasc operates a number of training and educational courses for farmers and people who are involved in the application and use of such products.  In addition Teagasc has published a voluntary code of good practice, which is available to all farmers, on the handling, application and storage of pesticides on farms.</P>

      <Quest>the reason it was necessary for the plaintiff in the case taken against him by a company (details supplied) to lodge writs of execution with the Sheriff of the City of Dublin for execution against the goods and chattels of the Department in the sum of £538,463.54 being the legal costs and interest thereon due to the plaintiff by orders of the High and Supreme Courts in proceedings started in 1990 against him.</Quest>

      <P>The case in question dates from 1990 and concerns a decision of the Department in relation to a dispute between several meat processors and the company in question as to entitlement to rights to import beef under the GATT import quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the background of the case is legally and technically complex, the essential fact which gave rise to the legal proceedings in the first place was the decision by my Department to award the import quota rights to the meat processors rather than to the company in question.  This decision, which was taken supported by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, was based on the Department's interpretation that, since the licences had not been transferred to the company in question in accordance with the procedure prescribed by EU regulations, that company was deemed to have acted as an agent of the processors <Col N="1132" /> and the processors themselves were deemed to have imported the beef under the regulations.  While the decision of my Department was made in good faith, it was, nevertheless, found to be unlawful by both the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Based on the findings that my Department had incorrectly interpreted the relevant EU regulations, the Supreme Court awarded costs against it.  My Department was given leave to recover 50 per cent of the cost from the processors from the time they had joined the case.  In addition, damages amounting to approximately £463,000 were awarded against my Department to the company. These damages were paid in 1991.  This was appealed to the Supreme Court and that court delivered its judgment in March 1997 in favour of the company.  The bill for costs was lodged with the Chief State Solicitor's Office by the company solicitors in May of this year.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that there was no reluctance on the part of my Department to pay the costs which it was bound to pay, nor was there any delay in doing so.  As the sequence of events will show, the first notification my Department received in regard to the costs was received on 28 September last from the Chief State Solicitor's Office, which handles these matters.  I regret, therefore, that the company felt it necessary to try to secure payment through sheriff's orders.  The facts are that my Department had made arrangements to pay these costs on the actual day the Chief State Solicitor confirmed that it was obliged to pay the costs in full.  My Department had proposed to the Chief State Solicitor that, in line with the ruling of the courts, it should pay 50 per cent, with the balance being paid by the meat processors.  The costs were paid on 27 October.  As regards interest, negotiations were proceeding between the Chief State Solicitor and the legal representatives of the company in question, and the enforcement order issued before these were completed. The interest was paid on 30 October, the day the bill was received.  Therefore, as can be seen, my Department's direct involvement in this was completed within one month.</P>
    <P>My Department has asked the Chief State Solicitor to recover from the meat processors their share of the legal costs and interest charges in accordance with the court rulings.  I understand that the Chief State Solicitor has instructed a firm of legal cost accountants to assist him in recovery of these costs in accordance with the orders of the court.  I have also asked the Chief State Solicitor to pursue the question of the processors' contribution to the damages paid by my Department to the company.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, both the costs and the interest were paid to the legal representatives of the company without delay well within the normal time frame for such matters and I am satisfied, <Col N="1133" /> also, without the need for the involvement of the Sheriff's office.</P>

      <P>Because of the major challenges ahead for the beef industry, I have decided to set up a task force which will examine and make recommendations to facilitate the future development of the industry.  The precise terms of reference will be agreed at the first meeting of the group but the aim will be to set out a strategic action plan covering the complete range of activities across the whole cattle and beef spectrum from primary production right through to the processing and marketing ends.  The McKinsey report, which I commissioned through Forbairt earlier this year, provides a useful starting point for the work of the group and will be drawn on in the preparation of the action plan.</P>
      <P>Because of the comprehensive nature of the task ahead and to ensure the widest possible representation within its remit, members are drawn from senior levels within the production and processing side of the industry as well as from the relevant State agencies.  Organisations or bodies not represented on the task force will be given every opportunity to make submissions and to meet with the secretariat of the task force.</P>
      <P>The task force will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food, and I will circulate the membership in the Official Report.  Given the nature of the task involved, I believe the composition of the group strikes the right balance and that collectively the membership brings the necessary expertise to address the issue which will facilitate the development of the sector.</P>

      <P>The Structural Funds food sub-programme provides a framework for the development of the food industry to the year 2000.  In this context, a particular focus is placed on the marketing of Irish food and drink products on both the home and export markets to include both the retail and food service/catering operations.</P>
      <P>In tandem with this, An Bord Bia, in striving to achieve its primary aim of accessing every viable market for Irish food and drink products, has a strategy which includes support for the retail food sector.  This support is provided mainly through means of promotional activities such as media campaigns, food fairs and regional food festivals. In the restaurant and food service areas the board's activities comprise specialist seminars, specialist publications, a hotel and restaurant guide and tailor-made restaurant promotions. Seminars highlighting the high and unique quality of Irish food are conducted for chefs, student chefs and visiting overseas chefs.  <i>New Irish Cuisine</i> is a highly regarded publication featuring innovative chiefs and the development of Irish contemporary cuisine, while the <i>Travellers and Diners Guide 1998</i> features An Bord Bia awards of excellence.  In addition to supporting the various promotional activities, An Bord Bia's food advisory centre carries out an ongoing programme with retailers, schools and restauranteurs as part of its recipe development programme.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I announced, earlier this week, that interim arrangements had been agreed between our respective Departments to put a national framework plan in place for commonages in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  This interim plan is being put in place, pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans, and will incorporate the main environmental measures in the agri-environmental programme already agreed with the EU Commission. Under the national interim plan ewe premium quota rights in all of the commonages concerned will now be reduced by 30 per cent from 1998 levels.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this measure, the farmers concerned will be able to apply for the new rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, which provides for an annual payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres.  These enhanced payments will be available to any farmer in the areas concerned wishing to join REPS and, indeed, to farmers already participating in REPS in those areas.  The average payment for an existing REPS participant with 80 acres in the areas concerned will increase from £4,960 to £6,400 annually.  The maximum payable will increase from £6,200 to £9,400 annually.</P>
      <P>An alternative compensation scheme will be made available by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for farmers who do not wish to join REPS.</P>
      <P>Application forms for the new REPS measure may be obtained from my Department's local offices, where copies of the revised scheme document and specification will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in the counties concerned on their 1998 area aid application have been identified and are now being written to by <Col N="1136" /> my Department.  They are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  Arrangements have been made with the meat export slaughter plants to dispose of the ewes concerned between now and 4 December at no cost to the farmer.  The 1999 ewe premium entitlement of the farmers concerned will be limited to 70 per cent of their 1998 quota and 1999 sheep headage entitlement will be limited to 70 per cent of 1998 entitlement.</P>
    <P>The farmers concerned are already entitled to a payment of up to £300 under the winter fodder scheme for farmers with mountain breeding ewes. In order to assist sheep farmers who are subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quota, I am now making arrangements to pay an additional £10 per ewe on the 70 per cent balance of their quota. It is expected that all of these payments will be made during December.</P>

      <P>The fodder scheme which I announced recently will provide financial assistance to help alleviate the losses incurred due to the fodder shortage.  A sum of £10 million is available overall. Sheep farmers with mountain grazings and suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers, with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons, in the worst affected areas of counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo will receive assistance.  The areas concerned have been identified as the worst affected in a Teagasc survey completed in September and payments under this scheme will commence as soon as the necessary clearance is received from the EU.</P>
      <P>The payments will be made automatically by reference to the 1998 sheep headage and suckler cow application forms, or on specific application from dairy farmers.  Up to £300 per farmer will be payable and this will provide immediate assistance to those most affected.</P>

      <Col N="1138" /> In regard to difficulties on international markets I have been concerned about the implications of this situation, especially in the Russian market.  In early September I made strong representations to the Commission for a range of measures to be put in place.  I am pleased that the Commission has responded favourably to my request and has introduced the following measures: a 21 per cent increase in export refunds which is worth an extra 9p/lb; a widening of the intervention support through an increase in the eligible carcase weight limit to 360kg and the inclusion of the 04 grade &mdash; this has increased eligibility of our steers from 15 per cent to almost 50 per cent; and an increase of 40 per cent in the processors margin for cattle going into intervention.</P>
    <P>I succeeded in reopening the Iranian market which was closed to Irish beef since 1996.</P>
    <P>These market support measures have stabilised prices and indeed there are indications of a recovery in the market.  However, there is scope for much further improvement in view of the 9p/lb increase in refunds, the flexibility of the intervention arrangements and the relatively strong market prices on the EU continent.</P>
    <P>I wish also to point out that the income position of producers will also be assisted this autumn as a result of the Commission granting my request to increase the advance of the premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent which is worth £45 million.  This will help the cash flow of producers, particularly those who are experiencing fodder shortages due to the wet summer.  Many of these latter producers will also benefit from the fodder aid package which I have already referred to.</P>

      <P>On 9 October 1998, the European Commission submitted a report to the Council on the operation of the Own Resources system.  In addition to reviewing the system, the report also considered the issue of budgetary imbalances as between member states.  The report suggested three options for addressing these imbalances if there were broad agreement on the need to do so.  One of these options involves national co-financing of CAP expenditure on direct payments at a level of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is totally opposed to this option.  The financial burden involved would fall disproportionately on the less prosperous member states, such as Ireland, which are most dependent on agriculture.  Moreover, this option would contribute <Col N="1139" /> only in part to correcting the budgetary imbalances of the member states concerned. Also, as the Commission's report itself states, &ldquo;budgetary balances measured by the simple difference between contributions to and receipts from the EU budget, represent only a narrow view of, and fail to fully account for, the benefits accruing to member states from participating in the EU&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The potential cost to the Irish Exchequer of the 25 per cent co-financing option would be in the region of £85 million in 1999 rising to £160 million in 2006.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report is being examined at official level in Brussels in preparation for further consideration at Council level.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance under the fodder scheme is being made available to all sheep farmers with mountain grazings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers, with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons, in the worst affected areas in counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo.  These areas were identified as the worst affected in a Teagasc survey completed in September and the aim of the scheme is to give immediate help to farmers who were badly affected by the fodder crisis.  For this purpose a sum of £10 million is being provided with a ceiling of £300 per farmer.</P>
      <P>While some farms outside the designated areas have fodder difficulties, in general they are located in areas where access to fodder in the general geographical area is more readily available. Accordingly, it is not planned that such farms will be included in the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with national legislation, Statutory Instrument 103 of 1996 and Council Regulation (EC) 820/97, cattle born here since 1996 must be identified by means of two plastic ear tags each containing the same unique tag number, whenever they are moved from a holding whether to another holding, a mart a meat plant or for export.  An animal bearing only one plastic ear tag is not legally identified and cannot be allowed to move.  Experience has shown that where animals are correctly and securely tagged in accordance with instructions, tag loss in transit is low. There is no derogation as regard movement from the double tag requirement provided for in the Council regulation or in the national legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the correct identification of cattle is an essential requirement for traceability purposes.  It is most important therefore that all aspects of the tagging arrangements are fully complied with at all times in order to provide the assurances demanded by consumers.</P>

    <P>I have evaluated the problems being experienced by farmers, which have arisen primarily from the economic difficulties in Russia.  At every available opportunity I have drawn them to the attention of my EU colleagues and to the EU Commission.  I made plans to deal with the matter across a wide range of headings.  I have also taken effective measures to support farm income at EU and national level including: substantial increases in export refunds for cattle and pigs; improved intervention access for beef, with heavier cattle together with steer class 04 included, while the processors' margin has been increased by 40 per cent; private storage schemes for pig and sheep meat; direct payments to farmers, estimated at <Col N="1141" /> almost £1 billion in 1998, have been speeded up; the advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments has been increased from 60 per cent to 80 per cent; the Iranian market has been re-opened for Irish beef; and an additional £16 million has been made available for a winter fodder feed scheme and a cull ewe scheme.</P>

Applicants who have been contacted by the unit are urged to respond in writing without delay so that these cases can be cleared for payment as soon as possible.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special areas of conservation may be designated on either private land or on commonage land.</P>
      <P>In relation to SACs which include commonage land, a framework plan must be drawn up for each commonage setting the stocking levels necessary for the environmentally optimum grazing of lands and to allow for the regeneration of vegetation.  It is not possible to say in advance of the availability of each commonage framework plan what the level of destocking, if any, will be required.</P>
      <P>It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.  In the meantime, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  As I announced earlier this week under these interim arrangements a destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of the quota held in 1998 will apply in all commonages in the following counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages.  This means that farmers in these areas either already in REPS or who join now can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.  This compares to £62 per acre per 100 acres for these areas in REPS.  I have also announced additional aid for farmers in these areas who are subject to the general reduction of 30 per cent in sheep numbers at £10 per head on their revised quota.</P>
      <P>For SACs on private lands the agri-environmental plan must conform to the conservation and farming conditions already agreed for the type of SAC involved.  Under these conditions there may be a requirement in some SACs for a certain level of destocking to take place.  This can only be determined when the plan is drawn up. The new REPS compensation rates will also apply in these areas.</P>

      <P>In the Estimates for the Department for 1999 which we published yesterday, an additional £25 million is being provided for the on-farm investment schemes.  This funding will allow the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes in a more focused form in 1999.  These new schemes will be better targeted towards those farmers most in need of assistance and will facilitate entry in the REP scheme.  This extra funding, is additional to some £45 million which I had already secured for these measures since taking office, and is in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium and will facilitate investment necessary for the development of the industry.  As regards the scheme of installation aid, I have also secured funding for the restoration of this scheme which will also be focused on those farmers most in need of assistance.  The terms and conditions of the new scheme will be announced following the formal approval of the EU Commission and the Department of Finance, which is expected very shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 116 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hygiene and public health requirements in the meat plants for which my Department has responsibility are set down in EU legislation.  The legislation does not specifically provide for E.coli testing.  There is, however, a general requirement <Col N="1146" /> on the operators of these plants to observe general hygiene standards which are such as to prevent E.coli contamination.  There is also a legal obligation on operators to carry out microbiological testing of product to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.  In addition, the Abattoirs Act 1988 Veterinary Examination (Amendment) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 6 of 1998) prevent the sale to slaughter plants of livestock which fail to meet minimum standards of cleanliness and thus reduce the risk of E.coli contamination within the plant.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the risks associated with E.coli 0157, my Department, in early 1998, organised a wide-ranging E.coli testing programme in beef export plants.  The results of this testing have confirmed the effectiveness of the measures already in place.  I am satisfied, in the light of the controls implemented by my Department and the results of that testing programme to date, that any risks involved have been minimised.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the findings of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme of 5 November related to retail outlets which do not come under the control of my Department.</P>

      <P>Measure 5 of the REP scheme and agri-environmental specifications set out clearly the objectives to be achieved with regard to hedgerows. Among the objectives is the management of hedgerows on a phased basis to encourage their development with a diversity of height, stages of <Col N="1147" /> growth and form in the interests of wildlife, stock control and scenic appearance.</P>
      <P>The specifications set out suggestions on how to manage hedges for healthy growth and good quality, including those that require restructuring. A management option is to leave the hedge undisturbed.</P>
      <P>In order to strengthen this measure further and to ensure that it is meeting its objectives, special attention is being given to this measure and I will be issuing new revised specifications shortly which will deal with this issue.  Among the revisions are the maintenance of hedgerows in their present state, height, width and uncut/untrimmed where such hedgerows are of good quality.  Farmers will be encouraged to retain hedgerows and confine maintenance to essential practices such as stockproofing, inplanting with suitable species and the control of invasive species.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 60 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation in July last providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts.  This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with <Col N="1149" /> the Libyan authorities since early 1997.  The Libyan Government through the General Peoples Committee formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.  Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle.  In order to establish the reasons for these delays, which were of concern both to myself and the Government, our Ambassador in Rome, who is accredited to Libya, visited Tripoli again in mid-October.  The Ambassador was assured that there was no political blockage to the agreement and that it was now a matter for the Irish exporters to pursue contracts with the purchasing agency in Libya.  Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities through every possible channel with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice.  Our position is that an official agreement has been reached with the Libyan authorities and that it should be honoured.</P>
    <P>There is no trade in live cattle with Iran and I am not aware of any demand for such a trade. However, Iran was a traditionally important market for Irish beef until 1996.  I am pleased to say that a veterinary protocol was signed in Dublin on 29 October 1998 providing for detailed arrangements for the immediate resumption of the export of beef to Iran.  The successful conclusion of this protocol followed a week long visit here by a veterinary delegation from Iran and the decision in principle by Iran to re-open its market to Irish beef which I had negotiated in Tehran two weeks previously.  The conclusion of beef contracts is now a matter for the industry but I would be hopeful that these would be completed with the minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>Under the rules governing the Single Market, it is not possible to restrict imports from other member states on grounds of trade or to compel retailers to source only home produced products.  These rules apply equally in all member states and indeed the rules have worked to our advantage in that our food and drink exports are more than double the value of imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> However, the matter of consumer preference is something which cannot by definition be regulated and I am aware that post BSE, there has been a shift in consumer preference towards domestically produced product and a corresponding resistance to imported beef.  An Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility for the marketing and promotion of Irish food and drink products both at home and abroad, has adopted marketing strategies to meet the challenges posed by this trend.  Programmes have been developed and are already in operation to address marketing difficulties, including valuable quality assurance schemes which will restore consumer confidence. It is in the process of updating its strategy to ensure greater penetration of the EU market for beef.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the board in co-operation with the entire industry will continue to access every viable market for Irish food products to the benefit of the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>PRRS is a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals (Notification of Infectious Diseases) Order, 1992.  Following the recent outbreaks I supplemented that order by the Diseases of Animals (Notification of Infectious Diseases) Order, 1992, (Amendment) Order, 1998, last September. The 1998 order prohibits the movement of infected and suspect animals and animals which have been exposed to PRRS infection without movement permits issued by a veterinary inspector of my Department.  In practice such animals are permitted to move only to meat plants for slaughter and special attention is in all cases given to cleansing and disinfecting vehicles which have transported the animals.

      <P>The total legal expenses incurred by my Department in this case to date is approximately £538,000.  The legal costs of the State were borne by the Office of the Attorney General.  With regard to the legal expenses borne by my Department, the position is that both the High Court and the Supreme Court ordered my Department to recover from the meat processors 50 per cent of the legal costs paid by my Department to the legal representatives of the company from the time they joined my Department in the case.  I fully intend to implement this ruling of the courts.</P>
      <P>Immediately after my Department was informed by the Chief State Solicitor that the legal costs of the companies had been finalised by the Taxing Master, my Department drew the attention of the Chief State Solicitor to the order of the High Court and the Supreme Court relating to the recovery of costs and asked that the processors should be required to pay their share of the costs.  However, the Chief State Solicitor, having received advice from counsel, informed my Department that it was obliged to pay the full legal costs in their entirety and subsequently seek to implement the order against the processors.  In light of this advice, my Department dealt with this matter without delay and has paid both the legal costs and associated interest charges to the legal representatives of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that there has been no delay on the part of my Department in seeking to implement recovery of the costs from the processors.  The position is that, according to the legal advice given to my Department, it was not possible for recovery to be made until such time as my Department had first paid the costs.  Immediately these costs were paid, my Department instructed the Chief State Solicitor to enforce the court ruling. I understand from the Chief State Solicitor that this is under way. <Col N="1153" /> As far as the case itself is concerned, I want to correct the implication in the question that the Supreme Court found that the company was the victim of unlawful collusion between my Department and the meat processors.  This is not the case.  The court found that the Department's administration of the GATT beef import quota was not in accordance with EU law.</P>
    <P>Following the ruling of the courts, my Department initiated an internal review of the circumstances surrounding this case.  This review has found, <i>inter alia</i>, that the original decision in relation to the allocation of licences was made in good faith, even if subsequently found to be legally incorrect, and that while it found fault with some of the administrative procedures employed and deficiencies in customer relations in handling the issues, there was no evidence of collusion.</P>
    <P>I make the point that this case was extremely complex and technical.  The management of the GATT quota was originally left to the member states and my Department decided at that time to allocate the licences to a range of companies involved in processing beef.  The basis for this was the significant contribution made by those companies to employment and value added and the benefits derived from the licences would help to improve their competitiveness relative to processors in other member states.  This was entirely consistent with EU legislation.  When the management of the quota was centralised at EU level in 1989-90, a dispute arose between the processors and Emerald Meats as to entitlement to the licences.  My Department decided in favour of the meat processors.  This decision, which was supported by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, was based on the Department's interpretation that since the licences had not been transferred to the company in accordance with the procedure prescribed by EU regulations, the company was deemed to have acted as an agent of the processors and the processors themselves were deemed to have imported the beef under the regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department has fully accepted that both the High Court and the Supreme Court had ruled against this interpretation and has implemented the ruling of the courts.  My Department paid a sum of approximately £463,000 in damages to the company in 1991 in line with the court ruling along with the costs referred to earlier.  In addition, the entitlement to licences were restored to the company for future years and licences for substantial quantities have been issued to the company each year since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a number of overtures in recent months to persuade Bord na Móna to agree to the long-term lease of a minimum of 5,000 acres of peatland around the Coole area for development by a competitor of Bord na Móna's horticultural peat business.  The latest such representation was made to me on 3 November.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was established to develop the peat resources of Ireland.  The company's activities now include: the supply of milled peat for electricity generation, the production of moss peat for the domestic and international horticulture market, the use of peat for the production of briquettes, and the environmental application of peat for waste water and odour treatments.</P>
      <P>The company has long-term contractual obligations to supply existing ESB peat-burning generating stations and the new 120MW power plant to be built at Edenderry.  It must maintain sufficient reserves of peat to meet these existing and future obligations.  The company employs over 1,800 permanent and 600 seasonal staff in Ireland, mainly in the midlands.  Over 60 people, 48 of whom are permanent, are employed in Bord na Móna's activities in the Ballivor/Coolnagun area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bad weather of the past two years has had a serious impact on the ability of all peat producers, including Bord na Móna, to meet their sales commitments.  In order to ensure that existing contractual arrangements can be met, the <Col N="1155" /> company has been obliged to notify existing customers in Europe that it is currently unable to supply their increased requirements for horticultural peat this year.  Bord na Móna has built its reputation in the horticulture industry on top quality sphagnum peat and it obviously intends to maintain that standard.  The maintenance of those standards requires long-term planning of production and harvesting.</P>
    <P>Many of the bogs that have been developed over the years for horticulture have now been exhausted for this grade of peat and their usage has switched to fuel.  Many of the existing horticulture bogs are equally now close to the stage where their future use will be for fuel production. Bord na Móna therefore will require the top quality horticulture bogs in its ownership, such as those referred to in the question, for future production. The company envisages that the bogs referred to will be in production and the moss peat processed in Ireland within the next few years.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna's horticultural business is in competition with companies both here and in Europe.  The horticultural business in Europe operates in conditions of intense competition. Aside from the considerations set out, the company can see no obvious commercial rationale for making any of its bogs or peat available to a competitor of its horticulture business.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to introduce a buy-out scheme like the one in 1993 whereby farmers could buy-out their annuities at a discount of 50 per cent on the outstanding capital provided any arrears of repayments were also paid.  I am aware that some farmers may be having difficulties in meeting their annuity repayments and inspectors from my Department have been and still are visiting farmers who have arrears of £2,000 and over with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment. If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period.  On the other hand, if it is found that there is no good reason for non-payment of the annuities my Department will have to consider taking legal action in the matter.</P>

Samples from over 50 deer in Wicklow have been taken and this figure is being added to by a more focused sampling in bad areas during the shooting season.  Preliminary indications are that there is some level of TB infection in the deer population.</P>
    <P>In view of the TB situation in County Wicklow, a special programme is in place in east Wicklow whereby herds are tested in six-monthly intervals rather than at annual intervals.</P>
    <P>As regards badger surveys, the position is that 36 licences have been approved for counties Carlow and Wicklow since 1 January 1996 and the percentages of badgers which were positive on post mortem were 19.63 per cent and 7.27 per cent respectively for each county.</P>

      <P>Food labelling requirements laid down by national and EU regulations, require that food sold in pre-packaging form must carry the name of the country of origin only when the absence of this information would mislead.  The application of this legislation is monitored by the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>Origin marking for a wide range of imported goods was a legal requirement in Ireland until 1985 when the legislation was revoked following a threat of infringement proceedings against Ireland by the EU Commission.  In addition, the World Trade Agreement, to which both Ireland and New Zealand are parties, prohibits the imposition of a legal requirement on one member without it being a requirement for all members, otherwise this requirement is considered to be a technical barrier for trade.</P>
      <P>Consequently under existing legislation and agreements it is not possible for the State to put a compulsory tractability policy in place for New Zealand lamb unless a similar system is imposed at EU level on lamb from all sources including the EU itself.</P>

      <P>Under EU Regulation 820/97 which came into effect on 1 July 1998, all beef originating from outside the Community must fulfil similar traceability requirements as for EU beef where the label contains information other than basic information about the product.  The United States authorities notified the EU Commission of its procedures for approval of labelling claims on 9 May 1998.  Prior to the entry into force of this regulation only normal veterinary conditions would have applied to imports.</P>

      <P>The current legal position as regards the definition of specified risk material is set out in the Diseases of Animals (BSE) (Specified Risk Material) Order, 1998 (S.I. No. 144 of 1998).  This Order states &ldquo;that the skull, the brain, the eyes, the tonsils and spinal cord of a caprine or ovine animal which has a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum and the spleen of a caprine or ovine animal&rdquo; are specified risk material. In effect this means that the spinal cord of sheep over twelve months of age must be removed and treated as specified risk material.</P>
      <P>This order is being implemented by my Department at the plants for which it has responsibility. Implementation at domestic abattoirs is a matter for the local authorities.</P>

      <P>An application was made by the person named under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme on 30 May 1997.  Ten of the animals on the claim were not properly tagged which meant that the animals in question were not eligible for premium.  Payment of £3,926.44 in respect of the other 28 animals on the claim has issued.  In 1998, 11 animals on the suckler cow premium claim had identification errors which resulted in them being deleted without penalty from the claim.  An advance payment of £3,814.25 has issued to the person named on 27 October 1998 due to an error in processing he is due an additional grant.  The shortfall due will be paid to him within the next two weeks.  The applicant's third year REPS payment has been processed and a cheque will issue within the next few days.</P>

      <P>The farm modernisation scheme which provided for grant aid on a wide range of on farm investments was terminated on 30 September 1985 and was subsequently replaced by the farm improvement programme in 1986 which operated until December 1994.  A farm improvement programme limited to on-farm investments in horticulture was introduced in 1995 and remains in operation to provide grant aid to that sector.</P>
      <P>The major items of on farm investment formerly covered by the farm modernisation scheme and the subsequent farm improvement programme until 1994 have been grant aided under the control of farm pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme and I presume it is to these schemes that the Deputy is referring.  The acceptance of applications under these schemes was suspended from April 1995 in respect of the control of farm pollution scheme and October 1996 in respect of the dairy hygiene scheme.</P>
      <P>Additional funding has been allocated in the Estimates for 1999 for my Department to enable the reintroduction of these schemes on a more focused basis which will target grant aid towards those farmers most in need of the assistance.</P>

      <P>The Abattoirs Act, 1988, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the annual licensing of abattoirs serving the domestic market by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and for the supervision of the day to day operations, including ante and post mortem examinations, by the local authority veterinary services.</P>
      <P>Abattoirs are required to comply with the standards laid down in the Abattoirs Act, 1988 and the (Abattoirs) Regulations, 1989, as amended, in relation to construction, operation and facilities necessary to obtain an abattoir licence.  Consultation takes place with the local authority prior to the granting or renewal of a licence to ensure the applicant's compliance with the Act and Regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the statutory position, my Department secured Government approval in December 1996 to assist local authorities in implementing their functions under the Abattoirs Act.  In respect of 1997 a total of £1.4 million was paid to the local authorities who had confirmed that they fulfilled the necessary criteria, which are, of course, uniform for all local authorities.  A similar level of financial assistance is being made available to local authorities for 1998 on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I have taken a number of initiatives at both national an EU level aimed at alleviating the situation for Irish pig producers.  Any action in relation to the pigmeat sector must, of course, be compatible with the common organisation of the market for pigmeat under CAP and with EU law.</P>
      <P>On three occasions in the past five months I have secured increased export refunds from the EU Commission, the most recent one being 33.33 per cent, effective from 15 October.</P>
      <P>I also succeeded in gaining agreement from the Commission for the introduction of an EU funded storage scheme which provides for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat destined for export to third countries for up to six months prior to shipment.  On export the meat will also benefit from the payment of an export refund.</P>
      <P>At the request of Ireland and a number of other member states the Commission agreed to consider further action aimed at improving the situation for pig producers.  Among the ideas under consideration are improvements to the private storage scheme to make it more attractive to Irish processors, a special export refund for the Russian market and also certain supply control measures.</P>
      <P>As regards slaughtering capacity, the fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland caused a backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter in the Border region.  To deal with the problem arrangements were put in place which has resulted in an increase of between 5,000 to 8,000 pigs per week being slaughtered at EU approved premises.  In addition, the McCarren plant in County Cavan has reopened recently and is slaughtering pigs. This plant has the capacity to slaughter up to 6,000 pigs per week, and will undoubtedly go a long way in eliminating the slaughtering backlog in the Border region.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia launched a promotion campaign earlier in the year aimed at increasing pigmeat consumption by encouraging the sales of pigmeat on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor the situation and with the support of other colleagues in the Council of Ministers to press the Commission to take whatever action is required.</P>

      <P>Bord Bia was established in 1994 for the express purpose of improving the export promotion and market development arrangements for food.  The board's objective, as set out in its five year plan, 1995-9, is to increase the sales and exports of the Irish food industry while strengthening its market position.  That plan is being implemented through a series of programmes, all of which are sufficiently flexible to enable them to be adapted to meet changing circumstances. Despite the marketing difficulties currently being experienced in some sectors, I am satisfied that the board's approach is the correct one and that, as evidenced by our food and drink export sales in 1997 &mdash; an increase of 3 per cent with earnings of almost £4.9 billion &mdash; it is proving to be extremely successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were published on 18 March 1998.  A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was convened on 31 March 1998 to enable Ministers to put forward their initial reactions to the proposals.  At that meeting, I informed the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests that would be affected by the proposals and told them that the proposals were seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and that, consequently, Ireland rejected them in their present form.</P>
      <P>A preliminary technical examination of the proposals was carried out over the following two months and the proposals were again discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 25-26 May, when a progress report was prepared for the European Council in Cardiff on 15-16 June.  The report contained an undertaking that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account in the final agreement.  That undertaking was in response to my request that the importance of beef and milk to the Irish economy should be acknowledged. The report included, also at my request, a recognition of the need to avoid renationalisation of the CAP and distortion of competition.  The European Council agreed that further negotiations should be based on the conclusions reached by the May Council.</P>
      <P>Technical examination of the proposals is continuing in preparation for the meeting of the Council of Ministers later this month.  It is expected that this meeting will make a further report to the European Council meeting to be held in Vienna on 11/12 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the coming months of negotiations, I will continue to put Ireland's case forcefully to my ministerial colleagues and to Commissioner Fischler both in the Council and bilaterally.  It is my objective to secure a final agreement which will provide a favourable framework within which the Irish agriculture and food industries can continue to develop for the benefit of workers in those industries and for the economy as a whole. In particular, I will be seeking full compensation for any price cuts, non-discrimination as between <Col N="1170" /> member states in any milk quota increase, more favourable treatment for extensive production and effective and practical measures for rural development and further improvement of agricultural structures.  I will also oppose any move towards the co-financing of direct payments.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out previously to the Deputy on 6 October 1998, responsibility for the promotion of Irish beef, both on the domestic market and abroad, is a statutorily delegated function of Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that every effort has been made to ensure unhindered access for Irish beef to worldwide markets both by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia. Irish beef is sold in over 60 markets worldwide and with the recent reopening of the Iranian market, all traditionally important markets are now open to us.  A special emphasis is being placed on securing a greater penetration of the more lucrative EU markets.</P>

      <P>The 1998 TB programme is proceeding with an emphasis on efficient management of the eradication programme, with complete and orderly rounds of testing and other follow up testing designed to make inroads into the residual disease incidence level.  Unfortunately, the rate of disclosure of TB reactors is higher this year than in recent years.</P>
      <P>Research projects, including the specialised work of the TB investigation unit, are continuing with the aim of providing new technologies required to eradicate TB.  The research is focused in particular on the role of the badger as well as establishing the best possible information on the causes of the disease spread.</P>
      <P>In relation to the current brucellosis situation and in consultation with the animal health forum, a number of new measures were introduced to combat the disease: from 23 February 1998 all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; from the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements, including monthly milk ring testing; revamped administrative procedures in my Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; increased epidemiology work by my Department's veterinary staff and a review of the epidemiology of brucellosis over recent years; an ongoing and intensive awareness/advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis and a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that farmers, the veterinary profession and marts are making every effort to implement the new arrangements.  The arrangements to be applied for both TB and brucellosis for 1999 are under consideration in consultation with the animal health forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef prices to producers in Ireland have always tended to be lower than overall EU average. The reasons for this included distance from the market, suitability of product and preference for domestically produced beef.  An examination of the prices paid in Ireland and the Community during the period 1992 to 1997 shows that Irish steer prices were on average 3 per cent below Community steer prices and 7 per cent below Community young bull prices.  However, since the BSE crisis in 1996, the gap between Irish and EU prices has been widening due to a fall in our exports to EU markets arising from a reduction in consumption and greater preference being given to nationally produced product.  This has led to a situation where exporters have a greater dependence on more volatile and lower returning third country markets.  The collapse of the Russian market has accentuated the difficulties since early autumn with the result that the gap between EU and Irish prices has now widened further.</P>
      <P>To address the market difficulties I have negotiated substantial improvements in market supports with the EU Commission through an increase in export refunds and wider intervention access.  These supports along with greater penetration of the higher priced EU markets should ensure that cattle prices increase over the coming months.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question on consumer prices the CSO collect data on a monthly basis but the most recently published retail prices for the &ldquo;basket of beef cuts&rdquo; was for August 1998.  The prices for August 1998 and November 1997 were as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Records available to me indicate that four cases of E.coli 0157 were reported by health boards to my Department during 1997, and three cases were reported during 1998.  The records also indicate that there were no fatalities due to this infection during these years.</P>
      <P>While all cases of E.coli 0157 infection in Ireland have been sporadic and there have not been epidemics of the infection here, I believe nevertheless, it is imperative that the medical profession, the public, and all persons engaged in food preparation are aware of E.coli 0157 and of the simple measures by which infection can be prevented.</P>
      <P>My Department has for several years now recognised the potentially serious implications of this infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.</P>
      <P>A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder was issued in December 1996 to all the Directors of Public Health in the health boards, who were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E.coli infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the general public on this matter. <Col N="1177" /> The leaflet advises, in particular, on the importance of properly cooking meat products, on the need to properly wash raw fruit and vegetables before eating, and on the importance of observing good food hygiene and personal hygiene practices in order to prevent and control outbreaks of E.coli 0157 infection.</P>
    <P>While there is a legal requirement under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981-1996 to notify cases of food poisoning generally, E.coli 0157 is not specifically notifiable.  However, the recently established National Communicable Disease Surveillance Unit, which will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne disease, is currently reviewing the whole area of disease notification and E.coli 0157 is being included in this review.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established an E.coli 0157 task force to examine the issue, and to advise on the appropriate response in terms of regulation, standards and education for consumers and producers.  I understand that this task force will report within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals.  However, as the determination of eligibility of the person concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to you.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a short-term payment which is designed to provide immediate assistance <Col N="1180" /> for those in need.  The purpose of the scheme is to ensure every person in the State has access to a prescribed minimum income, taking their household circumstances into account.</P>
      <P>The amount of SWA payable in all cases is the difference between the person's means and the minimum weekly income prescribed in law for the household type in question.  Household income is taken into account and reduces the amount of SWA payable by £1 for every £1 means assessed.</P>
      <P>In the case raised by the Deputy, the household consists of a couple without dependent children. The amount of SWA payable in respect of such a household is £109.60 per week, if they have no means.  If a couple has means of less than £109.60, then the amount payable is the balance required to bring their income up to £109.60. If a couple has means of £109.60 or more, then SWA is not payable.  In this case, the spouse of the person is in employment and, as a result, the household income exceeds £109.60 per week by over £40 per week.</P>
      <P>In assessing the means of an applicant for unemployment assistance, a proportion of any earnings which the person's spouse may have is disregarded.  This provision is designed to provide an incentive for unemployed people and their spouses to take up or stay in employment.  No such disregard applies in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, the purpose of which is to meet immediate financial need.</P>
      <P>The question of changes in the means test for supplementary welfare allowance on the lines proposed would have significant financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Since 1986, my Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks, and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems &mdash; such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; alarm systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding is not available for smoke alarms or <Col N="1181" /> for conventional burglar alarms under this scheme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to the scheme in 1996, and some 15,000 individuals were assisted that year.  In 1997 an initial allocation of £2 million was again made to the scheme. However, I sought and received approval from Government to allocate an additional £3 million to the scheme, thus allowing the Department to assist some 21,000 individuals in 1997.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was again allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  Subsequently I reviewed the position and, as recently publicly announced, I have obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme in 1998.  A total sum of £5 million has therefore been allocated to the scheme for 1998 and a total of 940 applications have been received.  This means that since I came into office in July last year this Government has allocated £10 million to that scheme as opposed to £2 million assigned to it by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Applications are being considered in the regional offices of my Department and they expect to be in a position very soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications. The maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the cost.  However the actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted in the current year.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  This final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>At present, to qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age; at least 156 contributions paid &mdash; from April 2002, this will increase to a minimum of 260 paid contributions and to a minimum of 520 from April 2012 &mdash; and a yearly average of at least 20 contributions &mdash; or 24 in the case of a retirement pension &mdash; registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The third condition is a minimum qualifying condition which applies to all insured people.  Its clear purpose is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of full-rate contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's working career.</P>
      <P>Therefore a person's entitlement is calculated from his or her date of entry into social insurance but it is acknowledged that the application of this rule can lead to particular difficulties for people who, for one reason or another, had &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; in their insurance records leading to a diluted yearly average.</P>
      <P>During the last decade, successive measures have been introduced to alleviate some of these anomalies: in 1997, the reduction of the minimum yearly average requirement from 20 to ten contributions per year, leading to a <i>pro rata</i> pension, the introduction in 1991 of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for people with &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; records, the rate payable being in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age-retirement pensions and the introduction in 1994 of the homemaker provisions to cater for periods of time spent outside the workforce caring either for children or incapacitated people.</P>
      <P>In addition a new <i>pro rata</i> pension will be made available to those self-employed, aged 56 or over in April 1988 &mdash; when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced &mdash; and who have at least five years contributions paid since then.</P>
      <P>I am aware that other issues still remain to be examined.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have long stated my commitment to ensuring the most broadly feasible contributory pension coverage to as many categories as possible.  With this in mind, my officials are undertaking a detailed examination and review of all the contribution conditions generally applying to the old age (contributory) pension and I would hope to have a report on this in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>The issues involved are complex and raise fundamental questions regarding the number of contributions, both paid and credited, that a person has, the PRSI actually paid in respect of their contributions and their overall value. Issues of equity and redistribution within the social insurance system also arise to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The costings requested by the Deputy are not readily available.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  In addition, widows or widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are also available to lowincome pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means-test.  The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is £83.00 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £88.00 for a recipient aged 80 years or over; plus £30.00; plus any increases for dependants or for living alone.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the free schemes, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted people who satisfy this condition.  This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of primary schools.  In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools.  The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase the awareness of the problem among school management, staff, pupils and parents.  A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>

It is currently a requirement in the new modular programmes that apprentices must achieve a pass level of 70 per cent in written assessment tests.
