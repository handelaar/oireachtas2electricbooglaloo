      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed), and No. 2, Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that Private Members' business shall be No. 38, motion re Ansbacher Accounts (resumed) and it shall be taken directly after the Order of Business.  Notwithstanding Standing Order 34(6), questions to the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland and any supplementary questions which may arise thereon may be taken on Tuesday next and, if not concluded, may be carried over to the appropriate time on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Is it intended that, following the Taoiseach's replies to questions, there should be a debate on Northern Ireland next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Whips agreed last night that there would be a debate of up to two hours on Wednesday and that that would cancel questions on Northern Ireland in the normal understanding of Standing Orders.  This motion is to ensure that questions will be taken on Tuesday and Wednesday in the normal fashion.  To confirm what Deputy Bruton has said, there will be a debate of up to two hours by party leaders on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Is it not within the bounds of possibility to take questions on Northern Ireland and the peace process within the work of the House today so that we do not give the sense of relegating this very important subject at this critical time?  It it is possible, I urge agreement that questions be taken today rather than deferring them until Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need to improve the public bus transport service, especially in Dublin, for people who have no other means of transport available to them?  Will he ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to speed up her decision making on the issue of road transport legislation to deal with the bus service?  The Minister claimed she was engaged in consultations on this subject with various organisations, but it transpired the most recent meeting took place in July 1996 and that no other meetings are planned.  The Minister has no basis for delaying decisions about promised changes to the Road Transport Act, 1933, to allow a proper bus transport service, both public and private, to be instituted for people in this and other cities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is legislation promised in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is intended the Road Transport Bill will update and amend the Road Transport Acts of 1933 and 1986.  It will be ready later in the year and work on it is continuing as a priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the widespread concern surrounding allegations about the conduct of one of the four major banks and specific accounts which seem to point towards comprehensive tax evasion, will the Taoiseach indicate when the Government proposes to table the motion to give effect to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Immunities and Privileges of Witnesses) Act which was passed by the previous Dáil?  It would allow the appropriate committee of this House, if it so chose, to inquire into the operation of these accounts and compel or ask various witnesses with information to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this matter has been discussed by the Whips and it is hoped to <Col N="599" /> introduce the sections of the Act dealing with compellability.  The required guidelines for these are being drafted by the Department of Finance. I believe this should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach communicate with me as to the precise timetable envisaged by the Department of Finance and others responsible for this?  The Act was passed by the previous Oireachtas and should be brought into effect so we can do the work we are elected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confirm it for the Deputy. I was told it would be a few weeks but I will attempt to confirm that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the refusal of Ryanair to accept the invitation to have the dispute with its workforce dealt with by the Labour Relations Commission, does the Taoiseach intend to take any steps to persuade Ryanair to do what almost every other company does and abide by the voluntary labour relations procedures?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach as concerned as everyone else that Ryanair's action may undermine this code? This is a matter of urgency.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that, at least, he will speak with the chief executive of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was as disappointed as everyone else at what happened yesterday evening.  I have stated my position in the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has been dealing with this matter and he has spoken to all of the parties concerned.  As in all disputes, both sides must eventually co-operate with each other.  It would be better if they did so sooner rather than later. Third party intervention seems like a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not even dealing with the actual issue of dispute which the workers are seeking to resolve.  The company refuses to deal with the trade union representatives appointed by the workers.  This is a fundamental issue and the Government cannot remain neutral. Will the Taoiseach not indicate that the Government is likely to take stronger action to insist that Ryanair abides by the rules adhered to by virtually everyone else?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pursue this matter any further on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful for the Taoiseach to have an informal discussion with the Employer-Labour Conference.  I have no doubt that IBEC and ICTU may be able to persuade those involved, particularly the management of Ryanair, to adopt a more partnership-oriented approach to the resolution of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's constructive remarks.  I assure him that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has tried that and other <Col N="600" /> routes over the past ten days.  I have to be honest and say that he has not had much success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> There was general surprise that the Attachment of Earnings Bill did not appear when the Government published the list of proposed legislation for this session.  This is sensible legislation which will free up much needed prison accommodation by having fines deducted at source from income.  It would free up prison spaces for the likes of the individual who went on the rampage yesterday and stole a car, leading to the death of an unfortunate woman in County Westmeath.  When will we see this long overdue legislation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that I speak for the whole House in expressing my regret at the horrific death of an innocent person going about her everyday chores.  The legislation is at a preliminary stage.  However, the broader question of how the attachments can be dealt with is being examined by the Department.</P>

      <P>Will the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill come before the House soon? It was stated that this would happen.  The National Youth Council has proposed that the by-elections and referendum should be held on a weekend.  Is the Government considering this proposal in the light of previous experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be produced in this session.  The Government has not given further consideration to the date for the election. Deputy O'Dea is urging everyone to agree to weekend votes.  I would welcome Members' views on the matter.  I have an open mind but I am not convinced that weekend voting would increase voter turnout.  Research carried out on the summer election suggests that voters used the early morning periods &mdash; there was a decline in voting in the late evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill will give 20,000 citizens the right to nominate a candidate for the Presidency. The Bill passed Second Stage in the last session.  There seemed to be some confusion as to how it would be dealt with on Committee Stage. It is a Private Members' Bill in the names of myself and Deputy McGrath.  I am told that it should be referred to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government rather than the all-party Oireachtas committee mentioned by the Minister at the time.  Will the Taoiseach arrange to have the Bill referred so that it can be passed into legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated to the Deputy that the constitution review group should look at the Bill.  I will look again at the matter.  Is <Col N="601" /> the Deputy inquiring if the Bill should go to the constitution group or to the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was unanimously agreed on Second Stage.  The Minister of State suggested that it would then go to the all-party Oireachtas committee.  That is not a select committee so it cannot deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill.  If the Taoiseach thinks that the Bill should be examined by the all-party committee we should discuss this proposal.  However, Committee Stage is the next stage of the legislative process.  I understand that the Bill should be referred to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government.  These are the two options.  I wish to see the Bill progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so.  However, there are major policy issues involved.  My preference would be for the constitution review group to examine the Bill.  I am not over the moon about 20,000 people being able to nominate a candidate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach seemed to indicate that the Bus Regulation Bill had been introduced in the Dáil.  The Bill seeks to amend the Road Transport Acts.  It was not introduced.  It did not lapse in the last Dáil.  It was my task to prepare it and I wish my successor well.  The Taoiseach may have inadvertently misled the House in stating that the Bill had lapsed.  It did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter which was raised yesterday by Deputy Michael Higgins concerning the publication of the wildlife and broadcasting Bills.  On 15 October the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that he expected the wildlife legislation to be published this month.  On 2 December he said he expected the broadcasting legislation to be published next month.  However, neither appears in the Government's legislative programme of Bills to be published before Easter. What has happened in Deputy de Valera's Department in regard to these Bills?  Why have they slipped from the legislative programme? Why was the Taoiseach given what has apparently proved to be inaccurate information by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question at some length yesterday.  Will I repeat my answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not say why he gave inaccurate information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained why to Deputy Higgins. The information given was in line with the understanding I received at that time.  However, the Department correctly carried out a more comprehensive examination to try to take into account the developments in digitalisation which have since occurred and which continue to occur. It wants to introduce a broadcasting Bill which reflects the state of the art changes in that area. To do so will take some time and, therefore, will delay the introduction of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In view of the widespread concern in every area of the country over the potential health hazards of microwave radiation from mobile phone masts, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="603" /> Law Reform to instruct the Garda authorities to put a stop to the further construction of such masts until there is widespread discussion and consultation with the relevant communities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of cases currently before the courts and the increasing cost to the Exchequer of the compensation claims in relation to deafness among Army personnel, is the Taoiseach planning to introduce legislation to deal with this issue, apart from amending the solicitors legislation?  Is the government examining the area of public liability or is it intended to introduce legislation, for example, to establish a tribunal or a board to tackle this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No further legislation is planned, but the Minister for Defence has been examining all ways and possibilities of dealing with this issue.  The number of claims has reached 11,500 but the potential number is far in excess of this figure.  This is the cause of grave concern for the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur faoi reachtaí atá geallta i leith cursaí chraolacháin i gcomhthéasc an Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachtaí. I find it hard to be convinced of the deeper consideration of digitalisation delaying the broadcasting legislation, but I believe the issue of digitalisation should be included in the Bill.  Why has the Bill which will put Teilifís na Gaeilge on a statutory, independent basis and which was promised in the last session not made it to the also ran list D?  Legislation concerning television coverage of sporting events was also promised in order to implement EU Directive No. 3a.  The idea was that we would wait for the EU to agree on a common position and would then introduce a short Bill to implement the directive.  Do people have to wait for the Bills concerning the autonomy of Teilifís na Gaeilge and for the guarantee that Rupert Murdoch will not prevent ordinary citizens from looking at major events before the broadcasting legislation is ready?  We may have to wait until next year if digitalisation is only now becoming a consideration. These two Bills were specifically promised in the last session.</P>

      <P>I thank the House and particularly the Opposition parties for facilitating me this morning.  Unfortunately, owing to official business, it was not possible for me to be present in the House yesterday when expressions of sympathy were being extended to the family of the late Jim Gibbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim Gibbons was elected to this House in 1957. He was appointed in charge of the Office of Public Works in 1965 when Seán Lemass recognised that he had a deep knowledge and appreciation of our rich architectural heritage.  During that time he started a nationwide campaign to restore many public buildings and to increase public awareness of that heritage.  In 1969, he was appointed Minister for Defence and throughout his period as Minister he showed an unflinching dedication to protecting the integrity of our Defence Forces and to honouring his constitutional <Col N="607" /> role.  He was probably best known by the people of Ireland as Minister for Agriculture, with his practical knowledge of, and expertise in, farming.  I know that farmers deeply appreciated the knowledge he brought to that particular job.</P>
    <P>For many years, Jim Gibbons felt that his main protagonist in the Arms Trial &mdash; the controversy which scarred him for his entire life &mdash; would vindicate his good name.  That never happened but as events have unfolded over the years, the public has vindicated his good name and integrity.</P>
    <P>I knew Jim Gibbons well in his last few years in this House.  He engaged with few Members to whom he did not send a cartoon.  He pencilled cartoons of most Members when on this side of the House and the other and while at parliamentary meetings.  I first got to know him when he sent me a very flattering cartoon at a meeting.</P>
    <P>Although we were generations apart, Jim Gibbons and I became close friends.  He was a lovable man and someone who had great dignity.  He was also a very quiet man.  Sitting at the opposite end of a table one could hardly hear him at times. When I visited him last summer, he still had a great interest in politics.  Although he was very ill and unable to walk, he wanted to discuss political issues.  I think he was somewhat encouraged by what he was hearing from the political debate which was taking place, not so much in this House but in another forum.</P>
    <P>Jim Gibbons was a very intelligent person who was underestimated at times.  He was very well read and could discuss almost any subject.  I have already extended my sympathy to his wife, Peig, and to his children, particularly his son, Jim, who is the chairman of our parliamentary party.  He was very much a family man and his family had to endure many tragedies of which Jim Gibbons had more than his fair share.  It is fair to say that Jim Gibbons has been, and is being, vindicated. That is a great solace to his family who have had to endure enormous stress over the past 25 years or so.</P>
    <P>I wish his wife many years of happiness as she has had to contend with a great deal of tragedy particularly during the past few years of Jim's illness during which she nursed him at home.  We will all miss Jim Gibbons and Irish public life is at a loss because of the passing of somebody with his integrity.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Bruton on 28 January 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann &mdash; recalling the serious public concern which arise from the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) published on 25 August 1997 which established that irregular payments were made to, and benefits conferred on, certain persons who were Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 1996,</P>
    <P>noting that the tribunal established that money was held on deposit in certain Irish banks by offshore banks in memorandum accounts (the Ansbacher accounts) for the benefit of Irish residents including Mr. Charles Haughey (the history of which deposits is set out in chapter 6 of the report of the tribunal),</P>
    <P>noting further that the Dunnes payments tribunal was unable by reason of its terms of reference to investigate the source of the Ansbacher accounts, other than in respect of sums paid by certain persons referred to in the said terms of reference,</P>
    <P>having regard to additional and serious public concern arising from the circumstances in which up to thirty-eight million pounds were held in the Ansbacher accounts outside the supervision of both the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank,</P>
    <P>resolves that it is expedient that the tribunal of inquiry established by the Taoiseach pursuant to a resolution passed by the House on 11 September, 1997, should inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following additional definite matter of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>the circumstances, considerations and motives relating to the creation, beneficial ownership and management of the Ansbacher accounts, for the purposes of investigating and reporting as to whether there has been any evasion of tax, contravention of exchange controls or other illegal activity associated with those accounts and making whatever recommendations it considers appropriate to prevent such a mechanism being used to avoid the payment of tax or to contravene exchange controls.</P>
    <P>and further resolves that the tribunal be requested to conduct these further inquires in accordance with the procedures set out in the said resolution of 11 September 1997, and in particular examine in public hearings, if it so decides, any account holders or beneficial owners of Ansbacher accounts, where there is <Col N="610" /> evidence that there may have been evasion of tax, contravention of exchange controls or other illegal activity associated with these accounts.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann &mdash;noting the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry established pursuant to the Resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann on 11 September 1997, and by Seanad Éireann on 18 September 1997;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting that the primary focus of the tribunal is on allegations of irregular payments made to and benefits conferred on certain persons in public life; -noting that the tribunal has already commenced its work and the Attorney General's legal advice that once a tribunal has commenced its work on existing terms of reference that those terms cannot then be changed;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting information coming to light as a result of the actions by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Companies Act, 1990;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the substantial powers of the Revenue Commissioners, the request by the Minister for Finance to the Revenue Commissioners and his Department to carry out a review of the existing powers in the light of the findings of the Dunnes payments tribunal, and the Government's commitment to provide additional powers where these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the investigation by the Central Bank of the issues raised by the Dunnes payments tribunal report in relation to exchange control;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting that the response of the Central Bank was referred by the Minister for Finance to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration and any action considered necessary, and to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation and any necessary action under the Customs and the Taxes Acts;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting that paragraph (p) of the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal requires the tribunal to make such recommendations as it considers expedient &lsquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax law should be made to achieve this end&rsquo;,</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Opposition motion to widen the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  Apart from the substantive issue which we want the tribunal to address, namely, the Ansbacher accounts, this House should have the ability to amend the terms of reference of tribunals it establishes when it is appropriate to do so.  Without investigation of the Ansbacher accounts this tribunal would fail the people and it would be discredited from the outset. The public knows the issue involved has moved far beyond the financial dealings of one or two people.  The shady dealings of the golden circle at the pinnacle of Irish society who are unwilling to pay their fair share of tax is what should be under scrutiny.  A light has been shone on the activities of some of the most wealthy and privileged people in our society and it should continue to shine on them and the full truth exposed.</P>
      <P>A full investigation into and exposition of the Ansbacher affair is the least that is required.  The Government is reluctant to allow a completely transparent process of investigation because it feels under an obligation to this greedy sector of the economy.  This was shown in the recent budget, with the dramatic cut in capital gains tax and a reduction in corporation tax, thus rewarding some of the least deserving while those most in need were robbed of the benefits of the so-called Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>I am trying to put the Ansbacher issue in context and in that regard I refer to an ESRI survey published in 1997 which shows that this State has the highest proportion of low paid workers in the industrialised world.  There has never been a time when company profits and the personal assets of the wealthy were greater, yet they were further boosted by the budget while those who really needed substantial relief were given a pittance in relative terms.  The message was clearly sent out that the privileged would be looked after once again.  What signal will be sent out now if the Government that introduced such a budget refuses to allow a full investigation into that sector of our society which, not content with the lowest levels of tax on wealth in Europe and the lowest corporation tax, spares no effort to evade taxation due under the law?</P>
      <P>The recent focus on a named Irish bank, that included reference to a Member of this House, has addressed only the tip of that iceberg.  An examination of the role played by the National Irish Bank in assisting the outflow of investment funds from this economy in avoidance or evasion of tax responsibilities must address all the banking institutions without exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate my support for the motion.  It is not just the credibility of the impending inquiry which <Col N="612" /> we are seeking to make full and comprehensive that is at stake but the credibility of all future such inquiries which may be set up by the House.</P>

      <P>This debate should not be taking place.  We know little more now about the Ansbacher accounts than we did on 11 September last when the Moriarty tribunal was established. At that time the Labour Party and Democratic Left tabled an amendment which would have allowed the tribunal to investigate the beneficial ownership and management of the Ansbacher accounts.  The amendment was voted down by the Government parties and failed to attract the support of Fine Gael on that occasion.  I am pleased that on this occasion the Fine Gael Party is taking a different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard the revelations on RTE last Friday regarding the scheme operated by the NIB.  There are remarkable similarities between the two operations.  Some aspects of the NIB scheme are even more disturbing than the details currently known to us in respect of Ansbacher.  All the indications are that the Ansbacher accounts involved a relatively small number of very rich people while the NIB portfolio held at least 178 accounts at the end of last year and I have no reason to believe most of them were not still in place at the beginning of this week.</P>
      <P>The beneficial owners of these accounts are not the super rich.  The amounts in the accounts are relatively modest by Ansbacher standards.  We are talking about middle Ireland, the local businessman, hotelier or garage owner, people involved in cash businesses who ultimately could not resist the temptation to hide some of their earnings from the Revenue.  These people do not live in exclusive mansions.  They are the middle classes, the respectable business people from all over the country.  They are the people who are never short of a few bob, but whose children received grants to go to university.  Their names are not known nationally, but they are known to everybody in the communities in which they live.</P>
      <P>This is profoundly important and has the capacity to provoke resentment well beyond Ansbacher.  We have become cynical about our leaders.  It surprised nobody that the super rich found ways to evade tax.  Only a few weeks ago the Revenue Commissioners told us many of the richest in our society legitimately use means to avoid tax, including many of the incentive schemes which have proliferated in recent years. What is different about the NIB scheme is that it tells us something about our neighbours; in a sense it obliges us to take a moral stance about our attitude to tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I watched coverage of President Clinton's alleged latest indiscretions on television last night, I saw some young men being invited to cast <Col N="613" /> down upon the alleged moral turpitude of their first citizen and they duly did so.  I could not help wondering what those young people would say to their mates in the pub or diner afterwards.  I suspect the message might have been somewhat different; they might have a sneaking regard for, or by envious of, the President, combined with the belief that if they were confronted with Ms Lewinsky or somebody of her kind they might not react differently from that of the first citizen.</P>
    <P>I cannot help wondering if we do not have a similar tolerance of tax evasion.  We condemn it in public but in private we are a good deal less clear.  If that is the case, it is time for change. Many people, the majority of whom are in the PAYE sector, could not evade tax even if they wanted to.  Those people agreed to low aggregate wage increases as part of the Partnership 2000 agreement and have built the economic success the country is enjoying.  The Partnership 2000 approach will be put at risk if the benefits of economic growth are seen to accrue disproportionately to others, at least some of whom are not paying their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>In the case of the National Irish Bank, a good deal of information is available in the public arena and there is no reason matters cannot be brought to a conclusion quickly.  In the case of Ansbacher, the information is not yet available and it is imperative that we create a mechanism by which it can be brought into the public arena. If we do not, the public will rightly conclude that we are complicit, wittingly or otherwise, in a cover up.  That cannot be allowed.</P>
    <P>These latest revelations raise crucial questions about our banking system which has gone through profound changes in recent years.  The emergence of the National Irish Bank in its current guise some years ago introduced a new element of competition into the sector.  Over the next few years, particularly after monetary union, we are likely to see different players in the Irish market.  Some European banks will probably set up here and it is possible that some Irish banks will be taken over by non-national banks.</P>
    <P>What we know about the National Irish Bank is different from anything previously known about commercial banks.  From time to time in the past individual branches of commercial banks have been found to be involved in improper activities, such as knowingly maintaining accounts in fictitious names, but there has never been proof that any bank was doing this in an organised way.</P>
    <P>In the case of National Irish Bank we know that its scheme was devised and operated nationally and we know that a small number of people located in Dublin were dispatched around the country to talk to prospective clients to sell them a product.  In some cases the bank or its representatives took the initiative of approaching individuals they thought might be interested.  This was not confined to any one branch and the clients were dispersed throughout the country. We cannot be sure that local managers were <Col N="614" /> entirely aware of the exact nature of the product being offered.  This was a head office exercise and it is inconceivable that it could have been set up without the active complicity of senior management.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is also clear.  There was no particular benefit to the client in terms of interest earned.  The commission charged by CMI and NIB was hefty, to say the least.  The only benefit to the client was anonymity.  This was a way of laundering or hiding money.  It may be that some clients had good and legal reasons to hide money, but the overwhelming likelihood is that many were looking to evade tax and the bank knew that.</P>
    <P>That one of the biggest banks in the State would be actively involved in touting a product, the primary purpose of which was to assist in the evasion of tax, is bad enough in itself.  However, it provokes questions.  The bank was and is competing for business &mdash; competing, in effect, for people's money.  What products are being offered by their competitors?  It would be irresponsible of me or anyone else to demand tribunals or investigations in the absence of <i>prima facie</i> evidence and I do not intend to do so.  As a general rule we have been well served by the banking system and those who work in it.  However, we should not bury our heads in the sand.  The activities of Guinness and Mahon with the Ansbacher accounts and National Irish Bank cast a cloud of suspicion over the banking system and something must be done to dispel that cloud.</P>
    <P>Hearings before a committee of this House would be an appropriate initial response.  We need to hear from the regulatory authorities, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  We also need to hear from the banks.  It is incumbent on the commercial banks to assure us as legislators and the public that they are not in the business of actively assisting tax evasion.  We cannot and do not expect the banks to act as guardians or guarantors of their clients activities but we are entitled to know whether the banks are actively involved in encouraging tax evasion and in touting products the purpose of which is to help such evasion.  To agree to this motion will help to deal with the Ansbacher case but we need to go further to re-establish public faith in the banking system.</P>
    <P>We need to be rigorously honest and up front. I wish to say a few careful words about the IFSC because the view is abroad that to question what happens there is tantamount to national sabotage. The annual return to the Exchequer from the IFSC is about £300 million and since the tax is levied at 10 per cent we must assume that the total profits are in the region of £3 billion.  We do not know what is the total turnover but we may assume it is a multiple of £3 billion.  The income generated in the IFSC represents a significant percentage &mdash; perhaps about 10 per cent &mdash; of our GNP.  By any standards these are staggering figures and they provoke questions about the value added and what goes on in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> I have no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity in the IFSC.  However, many of our European partners are not happy, to say the least, about the activity we encourage by our tax regime in the IFSC.  I will say no more than that.  Perhaps it is time to ask questions and to shine a light on these areas.</P>
    <P>In the first instance I would like to hear from the regulatory authorities.  They are open to criticism about the way in which they have dealt with the recent revelations.  However, we need to look to the future.  We need to establish whether further powers should be given to the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a manifest case for giving a &ldquo;trawling&rdquo; power to the Revenue Commissioners to inspect certain accounts or types of account where it is clear or where they have a reasonable suspicion that there is a scam or scheme of the nature operated by NIB.  It should not be necessary for them to identify individuals or individual account numbers. They must be given a more general power and my party will propose an amendment to the Finance Bill to that effect.</P>
    <P>It is important that those of us in a position of leadership in the House do not become part of a cover up, unwittingly or otherwise.  This is the second opportunity the House has been given to ensure a proper investigation of the Ansbacher accounts and I hope we do not lose it.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the specific terms of this motion.  I think it appropriate to remind the House of inquiries taking place in another forum.  I refer to the appointment by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, of an authorised officer to investigate the affairs of a number of Irish companies.  In making these appointments, the Tánaiste was invoking powers available to her under the Companies Act, 1990.  It is worth dwelling on these powers for a moment as they have an important bearing on the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is straightforward enough, from information already in the public domain, to chart the chronology of what has transpired to date.  First, the tribunal of inquiry into the Dunnes payments &mdash; the McCracken tribunal &mdash; reported to the Government on 25 August 1997.  Arising out of the report, the Tánaiste informed the House on 11 September 1997 that she had some days earlier appointed two officials of her Department to <Col N="616" /> examine the books and documents of Garuda Limited trading as Streamline Enterprises and Celtic Helicopters Limited.  More recently, at the beginning of this month, as a result of an interim report of the officer investigating the affairs of Celtic Helicopters, the Tánaiste decided to appoint the same officer to investigate the affairs of two further Irish registered companies, namely, Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Limited and Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited.  Once again these appointments were made under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, as was Mr. Ryan's further appointment last week to investigate Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.  The Tánaiste's announcement of the latter appointment seems to have received little or no attention but it is significant.  Although this company is registered in Grand Cayman it carries on business in the State and its agents and representatives here, of whom there are several, are subject to the jurisdiction of the authorised officer.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that, in appointing an officer at this stage to investigate the affairs of these three banks, the Tánaiste was reacting five months late to the report of the McCracken tribunal. This is not just incorrect and unfair to the Tánaiste, it also displays a lack of knowledge of the powers available under the Companies Acts. The Minister, through an authorised officer, has wide ranging powers under this Act.  In particular, she may require the production of books and documents of a company or other body corporate carrying on business in the State if the Minister is of opinion tht there are circumstances suggesting that its affairs are being conducted with intent to defraud or that the body was formed for fraudulent or unlawful purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 19 states that an investigation may be initiated if the Minister is of the opinion that there are circumstances suggesting:</P>
    <P>that the affairs of the body are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud &mdash; the creditors of any other person or that any actual or proposed act or omission or series of acts or omissions of the body or on behalf of the body are or are likely to be unlawful&mdash;</P>
    <P>Furthermore, an authorised officer has power under section 19 (3) to require the production of books or documents from any person who has possession of them, for example, advisers or consultants. Section 23 of the Act permits access in certain instances to documents relating to the banking affairs of a customer.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister may not act unless she has reason to believe that there exist some or all of the circumstances specified in the Act.  In appointing officers to examine the affairs of both Garuda and Celtic Helicopters she responded within a fortnight to information contained within the McCracken report.  It was not until she received an interim report of the officer in the case of Celtic Helicopters that she was able to form the opinion that further appointments might be necessary.  When these facts are considered it <Col N="617" /> is clear that the Minister acted promptly at all times, not just to invoke the powers available under the Companies Acts, but also to perform the duty that those Acts impose on the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>Given the provisions of the Act, it would be unsafe to assume that the simple fact of the appointment of an officer to investigate the affairs of the three banks is in itself an indication of any wrongdoing or unlawful act.  The purpose of an investigation under section 19 is to ascertain if there is any basis for concluding that such illegality occurred.  We are all aware that attemps were made in the courts on behalf of one of the banks, Irish Intercontinental Bank, to restrain the authorised officer from conducting his investigation. That legal challenge has been withdrawn and the bank has indicated its intention to co-operate fully with the investigation.  In view of this, I believe we can assume that the investigation is proceeding in a timely and proper manner. The other bank involved, Guinness &amp; Mahon Limited, was not part of this legal challenge and has, presumably, been co-operating with the authorised officer.</P>
    <P>What happens when the authorised officer's investigations are complete?  A report will be made to the Minister.  It is then open to her to apply to the High Court for the appointment of an inspector under section 8 of the 1990 Act.  Such an application may be made to the court <i>ab initio</i> or it may follow the outcome of a section 19 investigation.  An inspector has wider powers than those of an authorised officer, including immediate access to the High Court in the event of non co-operation.  In addition, an inspector's report may be published.  No doubt this is an option which the Minister will keep under review.  Seeking the appointment of an inspector under section 8 would be a serious option to be considered if any companies are found not to be co-operating fully with an officer authorised under section 19.</P>
    <P>In all cases where wrongdoing is determined, the Minister is permitted to refer the papers to the relevant authorities, for example, the DPP, the Minister for Finance and an officer of the Minister for Finance, such as the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners or the Central Bank. However, section 19 reports may only be published with the prior approval of the entities examined.</P>
    <P>Proceedings in relation to a breach of company law may be brought by either the DPP or the Minister.  The Minister may only initiate proceedings within a period of three years of the offence being committed.  She is already on record as stating that she regards this limitation as too short.  I agree with her and urge that consideration be given to extending it under future amendments to the legislation.  Fortunately, no similar restriction appears to apply to prosecutions initiated by the DPP.</P>
    <P>In the context of the motion, it is important also to record that the Act allows a section 19 report to be made available to a court of competent <Col N="618" /> jurisdiction.  Whether or not this includes the Moriarty tribunal may not be crucial.  The tribunal will no doubt exercise its powers to request a copy of any report and no doubt such a request will be complied with.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that since the publication of the McCracken tribunal report, the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland decided last October to establish a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Blayney. The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate the professional conduct of certain members of the institute named in the McCracken report. Although such investigations are normally held in private, the Minister was anxious that her Department should be permitted to attend and observe the proceedings of the committee.  When the institute indicated that it was not in a position to accede to that request, the Minister acted under section 192(2) of the Companies Act, 1990, to amend the statutory recognition of the institute. This served to require the institute to allow an official from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend and observe the committee's proceedings.  The House should commend the Minister's action, not only having regard to the matters of public concern involved, but also bearing in mind her overall responsibilities for company law and for the supervision of the accountancy profession.  The work of this committee is ongoing, and, no doubt, it will be possible for it to expedite its work having regard to the obligations of members of the institute to co-operate with its inquiries.  The House will be aware that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland is committed to publishing its report in due course.</P>
    <P>The investigations initiated by the Minister with regard to these matters are extremely useful. The powers available under the Companies Act are sufficient to ensure that the authorised officers appointed under section 19 should be in a position to make substantial progress in uncovering possible breaches of company law and of other legislation.  Part II of the Companies Act, 1990, which provides the legal power to investigate company operations, is standing up well to the demands of the last few months.  It is now of vital importance that the investigations under way should be allowed to proceed unhindered and without the distraction of outside influences. The authorised officer should be allowed to complete his investigations in proper accord with the powers vested in him under the Companies Act and in a manner that is equitable and fair to all the parties involved.</P>
    <P>With this as background to the debate, I wish to elaborate on why the House should oppose any extension of the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  First, and most importantly, I understand that the Government has received firm legal advice that it is not possible for the Oireachtas to alter the tribunal's terms of reference now that it has been established.  Nowhere <Col N="619" /> in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, is there an express power to amend an order which has already been made.  It was because of the absence of this power that the order made by the previous Taoiseach establishing the McCracken Tribunal included in paragraph (b) the possibility that Dáil and Seanad Éireann could extend by further resolution the terms of reference of that tribunal.  No similar provision was included in the order establishing the Moriarty tribunal and consequently I do not believe that it is now legally possible to change the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Second, the inquiries initiated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment cover many of the elements of the extended terms of reference which Deputies on the Opposition benches wish to impose on the tribunal. There is little benefit in duplicating that work by having the Moriarty tribunal cover the same grounds.  The results of these separate investigations will be made available on request to the Moriarty tribunal to assist it in the areas of inquiry relevant to its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It is already the case that Mr. Justice Moriarty has a very large body of work to cover.  He must deal with almost 20 years of Mr. Haughey's life. For almost ten of those years he occupied the powerful posts of either Taoiseach or Minister. The tribunal is also being asked to advise on a wide range of other issues, including the performance of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank and the accountancy profession as well as dealing with the large body of legislation which relates to companies and taxation.  This is a huge field of work and it would be inappropriate to add further burdens to Mr. Justice Moriarty at this stage even if it were legally possible for the Oireachtas to do so.  He should be allowed complete his work without further interference from the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The work of the Moriarty tribunal, coupled with the investigations which are being undertaken elsewhere, will permit us to get to the bottom of the Ansbacher accounts.  The most important information will come into the public domain in due course in a manner consistent with the law.  Accordingly, I see no reason to extend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal or indeed to establish a new tribunal of inquiry.  I hope the Opposition parties will be able to accept the legal advice made available to the Government prohibiting an extension of the terms of reference. I also hope that they will be able to accept the Government's bona fides in uncovering, and in seeking the prosecution of, any offences under company law or any other legislation which are discovered in the current investigations.</P>
    <P>The present enthusiasm of the Opposition parties for tribunals of inquiry is touching.  It is in stark contrast to their attitude when they were in Government.  In 1996 the Tánaiste first called for the establishment for what subsequently became the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> She was strongly opposed by all three of the rainbow parties and the Progressive Democrats motion to establish a tribunal was voted down. That motion was resisted in particularly colourful and intemperate language by Deputy De Rossa, if I recall correctly.  He said the establishment of a tribunal would be a recipe for putting journalists in jail but nothing could be further from the truth.  It did not suit the rainbow Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry at that stage because it thought the main subject of the inquiry would be one of its own Ministers, Deputy Michael Lowry.  Its enthusiasm for a tribunal grew once it learned that Mr. Haughey's affairs would figure prominently also.</P>
    <P>Mixing law and politics is a dangerous thing. The Tánaiste has sought to ensure that the corporate laws are properly enforced, without fear or favour to anyone.  That is as it should be.  There should be no golden circles or platinum circles, or any other kind of privileged circles.  Everybody must obey the laws of the land, including its tax laws.  If there are grounds for real suspicion of wrongdoing, it must be investigated and the appropriate action taken.</P>
    <P>Many commentators are drawing parallels between Ireland's Celtic tiger and the former tiger economies of South East Asis and pointing out similarities between our situation and theirs. Whatever about the similarities &mdash; and I am not sure they are all that great &mdash; it is vitally important that we focus on the differences.  In many countries in South East Asia corruption was rife, business and political elites enjoyed a privileged existence, virtually above the reach of the law, and corporate transactions were effected in a manner that was neither open nor transparent.</P>
    <P>That is not the case here.  In my terms as Minister for Industry and Commerce I sought to ensure that the corporate sector abided by the laws and that, where necessary, those laws were modernised and strengthened.  The Companies Act, 1990, is now on the Statute Book as evidence of what was achieved at that time.  I am confident that my successor in that office, the Tánaiste, will act vigorously and impartially to ensure that that Act is properly adhered to.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to reject the Opposition motion and to accept the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the items in the amendment.  Certainly there is serious public concern at the irregular payments that were made and at the irregular payments that were made and at the fact that there is £38 million in the Ansbacher accounts.  I do not agree with the proposed method of investigation and it is not right to proceed with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is like an arena of metaphors.  Yesterday Ryanair was compared with William Martin Murphy. It would be unfair to compare the proposers of this motion with the Tydings committee of the 1950s.  As to which of the first four signatories on <Col N="621" /> the amendment would be Senator Joe McCarthy I leave to other people to decide.  Just as that investigation started small, it exploded into a form which eventually did no credit to the system of Government.  We have in America the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who has spent £30 million trying to besmirch President Clinton. Effectively it demeans public life and politics.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Howlin referred to Leona Helmsley and her claim that &ldquo;only the little people pay taxes&rdquo;.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that there should be no immunity from the tax laws for anyone.  He also said we must accept that tax evaders are cheating the health and the educational services.</P>
    <P>Only last Tuesday a 68-year-old pensioner took his 71 year old wife, who is in the last stages of Alzheimer's disease, to my clinic and asked if she could be given a long-term bed.  Fortunately, through the work of other public representatives and the health board, through very caring social workers, she was given a respite bed which she will take until a long-term bed is available. Money is needed and taxes have to be paid to provide the necessary services.  I agree whole-heartedly with Deputy Howlin that we need a fair and compliant system of taxation that applies to all.  Yesterday Deputy Noonan referred to the associated banks and other financial institutions which hold subsidiaries in the Isle of Man and Jersey and the fact that they have been successful. The statement was left hanging as to the reasons for the success.  It is important to realise the increasing internationalisation of trade and business, particularly in the software services, consultancy services, buying and selling.  A great deal of business is now done on a cross national basis in Germany, Hong Kong and throughout the world.  Irish people are particularly mobile, well educated and business oriented.  Business is done through trusts, offshore companies and partnerships. There are legitimate reasons for funds to be held in offshore subsidiaries of associated banks.  It is important not to harm the legitimate business of those subsidiaries.  To do so would mean that the funds which would otherwise flow into these associated banks would go to subsidiaries of UK and European banks in areas such as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>Where many people have benefited from trusts, partnerships or companies, tax is normally paid on a remittance basis.  For example, if a certain sum of money is remitted to Ireland, it would be accepted as being a taxable item.  That is the position in most cases.  There was a case in the McCracken tribunal where that was not so; money was remitted from an offshore account to an account in Ireland and it is understood from the report that tax was not paid on it.  That tax should be paid.</P>
    <P>On a European Union basis we have to tackle the matter of tax avoidance on business transacted within Europe to ensure the profits arising are brought into account for tax purposes in a country of the EU.  This raises also the question <Col N="622" /> of tax harmonisation among ourselves and our European partners so that the profits do not tend to go to the country which has the lowest rate of tax or to the Isle of Man, Jersey and other areas where there is no tax.  We should look at our Companies Acts regarding the formation of offshore companies for use by other nationals.  It appears the principal use of offshore companies is to avoid tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also had an anecdote about a person with £30,000 to invest who was offered an offshore deposit facility at a slightly lower rate of interest than would be offered on an Irish deposit or investment.  It is important to realise that in our tax returns &mdash; which many people have to return by 31 January &mdash; there is a statement which asks if a foreign bank account has been opened, where it has been opened and the name of the intermediary.  Under tax law it would be necessary for the person referred to by Deputy Noonan to declare on her tax return the name of the intermediary and where the fund is held. There is a specific item on the tax return on any offshore funds purchased in the preceding year. Something has already happened in the Revenue Commissioners relating to offshore funds that have been sold by National Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that if we do not continue on our present course, there is a risk that the tribunal will be compromised and made less effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>The McCracken report has thrown light on the so-called Ansbacher accounts.  It was clear that Judge McCracken and his team could not investigate them fully.  That is the central reason the Moriarty tribunal has been established.  The terms of reference passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas last September mandate that tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts to establish if Mr. Haughey or other office holder, past or present, is a beneficiary of the accounts and if any payment was made from the accounts to a Member of the Dáil or Seanad, past or present.  In so far as the terms of reference go, they enable the tribunal of inquiry to carry out its primary function, that is, to investigate whether payments were made to politicians through the mechanism of these accounts and to establish if political favours were conferred on anybody as a result of these payments.</P>
      <P>When Judge McCracken reported he said he believed that some of these accounts were held for legitimate reasons of trade but clearly indicated that others were held for irregular purposes. Consequently, he raised a wider issue than the issue of political payments, that is, whether these accounts were used for the purposes of tax evasion or to breach exchange control regulations. The Government continues to refuse to allow the Moriarty tribunal to investigate this aspect of the Ansbacher accounts, as was made clear by the Minister for Finance last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's position is clear and consistent.  It <Col N="623" /> believes the Ansbacher accounts should be investigated, not alone to establish whether payments were made to certain politicians but to establish whether they were used to evade tax or breach exchange control regulations.  It believes, however, that persons who are innocent should not be treated in the same fashion as those who are guilty.  Judge McCracken drew a distinction in his report between those who had Ansbacher accounts for legitimate trade purposes and those who had such accounts for irregular purposes.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty tribunal intends to proceed by way of private sessions.  It should be possible to establish on a <i>prima facie</i> basis who was involved in irregularities.  For those who were not involved in irregularities, the private sessions should be the end of the matter.  Those who were involved in irregularities through the use of these accounts should be subject to full public scrutiny.  That is what would have happened if the Government hade not voted down the amendment in my name and that of the Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Barrett, in the debate last September and what will happen if the government fails to vote down the motion.  I call on the Independents to act independently and not go along with the Government in a vote which is only in the interests of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>Much has been made by some commentators of the fact that I stated during the debate last September the tribunal should not engage in a prurient trawl through the affairs of law-abiding citizens.  That is my position and that of Fine Gael.  We believe that, as the tribunal does its work, it will become clear, in the private sessions, if some holders of Ansbacher accounts held these accounts for legitimate reasons.  If so, that should be the end of the matter.  On the other hand, those who may have been guilty of tax evasion or breaches of exchange control regulations should be pursued publicly.  That was the intent of the amendment in my name voted down by the Government parties last September.</P>
    <P>Judge McCracken stated in his report:</P>
    <P>It is not the function of this Tribunal to examine these deposits in any detail, and it may well be that a number of the Irish depositors may have been people engaged in international business which was greatly facilitated by having a sterling account abroad which did not require exchange control permission to operate.  No. doubt there were others who deposited the moneys in this way from other motives.</P>
    <P>Judge McCracken made a distinction between those who were possibly innocent and those where were clearly guilty.  Fine Gael wants to maintain this distinction between possible bona fide account holders and those who were breaking the law.  That is the reason it abstained in the vote on the Labour Party motion last September and pressed its own amendment of similar intent which would have required the tribunal to investigate fully account holders where there was a <Col N="624" /><i>prima facie</i> case of tax evasion or breaches of exchange control regulations.  I am glad the motion in the names of the four party leaders in Opposition which seeks to amend the terms of reference maintains this distinction.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that the Fine Gael amendment last September would have required the tribunal to report on the procedures used to evade tax or breach exchange control regulations by the use of these accounts and to make recommendations on how practices such as this in the banks could be brought to an end. Some commentators have argued that this would require the tribunal to investigate irregular account holders in secret without identifying the beneficiaries.  This is nonsense as anyone who has a passing acquaintance with the law will understand.</P>
    <P>If persons are being investigated for criminal offences by a court or tribunal &mdash; breaches of exchange control regulations and tax evasion are criminal offences which carry prison sentences as a penalty &mdash; they must be examined publicly. They have a constitutional right to publicly state their side of the story under oath.  There are some particular and special cases in the area of family law where proceedings are held in camera but under our judicial system the courts sit in public. Cases are argued and witnesses cross-examined in public.  Tribunals have the same power as the High Court and operate in the same manner.  It would not have been possible under our amendment proposed last September for the tribunal to operate in private.  Persons suspected of tax evasion have to be examined in public session.  It suits certain people to pretend they do not understand this and certain political opponents of my party to put a different spin on it.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty tribunal was mandated to investigate the political charges that there were political payments for political favours.  We wanted the tribunal to investigate whether there were tax evasion and breaches of exchange control regulations while maintaining the distinction between the innocent and the guilty.  We abstained in the vote on the Labour Party motion because it did not maintain this distinction and pursued our own amendment to a vote.  I do not want anybody rewriting history, as the Minister for Finance attempted to do last night.  We are delighted that there is now all-party agreement on this side of the House and that the motion and proposed amendment to the terms of reference maintain the distinction between those who are innocent and those who are possibly guilty of criminal offences.  If the Fine Gael amendment had been accepted last September, Mr. Haughey's challenge to the tribunal would have less merit, if any.</P>
    <P>The tribunal should investigate the procedures used for tax evasion purposes in the Ansbacher accounts.  The issue is much wider than those accounts in Irish Intercontinental Bank.  Similar accounts or accounts for similar purposes exist in other financial institutions.  That is the reason we drafted, after careful legal advice, an amendment <Col N="625" /> which dealt with the procedures.  I did not want to have it confined to a small number of accounts in Irish Intercontinental Bank.  The procedures used in other banks should be examined also.</P>
    <P>The recent revelations about certain accounts in National Irish Bank bear this out.  I have reason to believe other financial institutions have similar arrangements. In the light of what is now emerging about the accounts in NIB, I ask people to look again at what Fine Gael proposed in its amendment in September.  That amendment, which was carefully drafted after lengthy legal advice, went to the very heart of the matter, and many of the inquiries now being conducted by the Tánaiste, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank are simply playing catch-up and trying to arrive at the position the Government rejected when it voted down our amendment in September.  It will have a second chance at 12.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I ask the Independent Members of this House not to feel constrained or tied to a Government policy position which is illogical and not in the interests of the Irish people.  I can understand Independent Members voting to continue a Government in office and avoid an election, but an election does not hang on the result of the vote at 12.30 p.m. To amend the terms of reference, as we have proposed, would make the Moriarty tribunal far more efficient and effective and would get to the heart of the matter much quicker in terms of tax evasion and breaches of exchange controls than any of the other mechanisms outlined on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>This House must again declare war on tax evasion. Compliant taxpayers, particularly those on PAYE, are groaning under the fiscal yoke imposed on them by decisions of this House.  It is bad enough for compliant taxpayers to feel they are paying too much tax.  It is worse when there is incontestable evidence that there are others who, through a variety of arrangements, can evade their responsibilities and pay nothing or virtually nothing.  It will be a national disaster if it transpires that respected financial institutions are actively aiding and abetting schemes such as this.</P>
    <P>The Government must establish the truth.  It is being given an opportunity today to establish the truth in the most effective possible way if it accepts this change to ther terms of reference.  It should take that opportunity and not come into the House with a series of fig leaf arrangements processed through the Tánaiste's office designed to hide its embarrassment and not put efficient schemes in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy is a strange Minister.  It is clear that the first two or three pages of all his scripts are written by some politically motivated person, and then we get to the real speech written by the officials in the Department of Finance. Much of the time the Minister seems to be quite familiar with the first two pages of a script but <Col N="626" /> after that he seems to be as surprised as his listeners by the contents of the remainder of it.</P>

      <P>In the initial political stages of his speech yesterday &mdash; the bit stapled up front to get the sound bite &mdash; there seems to be no scrutiny whatsoever.  Anything goes and any piece of fantasy can be promulgated as a fact.  The Minister stated that not only did Fine Gael vote to establish the Moriarty tribunal on the basis of its present terms of reference but opposed any suggestion that those terms of reference might be extended or altered.</P>

      <P>The Minister sat in front of me throughout the day as I and Deputy Barrett proposed and voted on amendment after amendment to change the terms of reference, including an amendment which had the support of all the parties in Opposition which would have enabled Moriarty investigate the Ansbacher acounts to determine if they were being used for tax evasion purposes or to breach exchange control regulations. Yet the Minister for Finance can seriously read this speech into the record of the House. Are we living in the real world?  I have never heard a Minister for Finance, in the initial stages of a contribution, weave a web of fantsy and mislead the House in the manner in which this Minister has done.  I would say they were downright lies but that is unparliamentary language and the Chair would require me to immediately withdraw the remark.  The Minister should be more careful about the charges he lays when they are blatantly untrue.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with my colleague, Deputy Owen.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  As Deputy Noonan said, Deputy McCreevy is a past master in finding some sound bite to begin his contribution, and then we hear the rest of it.  In the early stages of his speech the Minister did everything in his power to find a way not to accept the motion tabled by Fine Gael and the other Opposition parties.  I remember the reason Deputy McCreevy became so well known. He was lauded for having the courage to go outside his own party and speak out against Charles Haughey, which he believed was the right thing to do, when others remained silent.  He has suddenly rolled over now and his tummy is being scratched by being in Government.</P>

Deputy McCreevy was always asked for his view because he was known for speaking out but now, as Minister <Col N="627" /> for Finance, he has dropped that courageous attitude.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Minister pilloried Fine Gael yet said that the Government will propose setting up a tribunal of inquiry in any circumstances that justify it.  I cannot think of any other circumstance more justifiable than the one on which we are putting forward this motion to amend the tribunal's current terms of reference.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton said last night that the Government is hiding behind advice to the effect that the terms of reference of the tribunal cannot be amended now that it has been set up.  The tribunal is a creature of this Parliament and we can, under the 1921 Act, amend its terms of reference if we so wish because that Act contains the clause &ldquo;. or any instrument supplemental thereto may provide that this Act shall apply, and in such cases the tribunal shall have all powers, rights and privileges as requested in the High Court&rdquo;. Clearly the Act envisaged that as the work of a tribunal proceeds, something may arise that would allow it have its terms of reference extended.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if anybody had knwledge of the Ansbacher accounts when the McCracken tribunal was being set up by the former Government last year &mdash; that information only emerged in the course of the tribunal &mdash; we would have included those accounts for examination by the tribunal.  However, because of the way Mr Justice McCarcken was working it was clear he could not proceed to examine the Ansbacher accounts unless they directly related to the politicians mentioned. The time has come for this Government to stop hiding behind a fudge that appears to be action but in reality is inaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government states in its amendment that it notes information coming to light as a result of the actions by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Companies Act.  This is the same Deputy Harney who said in the debate last September that a tribunal which has a narrow focus on a few specific areas runs the risk of requiring us to come back in a few months' time to establish a third inquiry.  If the Tánaiste were still sitting in her Opposition seat she would be shouting and screaming that the Government was trying to hide something or that the large parties had something to hide because they would not allow the Ansbacher accounts be examined.  She, too, has rolled over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that Deputies Harney and McCreevy, the two people who made their political reputations by shouting and roaring about honesty and integrity in politics, are the lead players <Col N="628" /> in refusing to accept this amendment.  They should take the opportunity now, before the Moriarty tribunal gets deeper into its work, to make the necessary amendments so that the public can have confidence restored in both the political system and the financial system.</P>
    <P>We do not know the truth of this, but too many taxpayers who have to pay their share of tax are disgusted that there may be people who have made a good deal of money on their backs and are getting away with using tax evasion methods through the use of offshore accounts.  As Deputy Noonan said, we as a party did not want to imply that anybody with an offshore account was breaking the law.  It is necessary to ensure there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that somebody is using such a system in the banking world to evade tax or to breach exchange controls.  That is why we tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why members of the Government have not been able to convince the Taoiseach that this motion should be accepted, because when the Moriarty tribunal was being set up he discussed the matter with the leaders of the other parties and came to the Dáil to thank them for their co-operation, although he ignored what they had to say.  What is going on between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they do not realise it is not just in the interests of the Opposition that this motion be accepted but it is in their own interests as parties to ensure they cannot be accused of hiding something or ensuring information that may be embarrassing to them is not uncovered?  It does not matter who may be embarrassed by that information.  We must ensure that integrity is maintained and that the public can be sure no wrongdoing is being hidden.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Harney, will participate in this debate.  She closed the previous debate on this matter.  Throughout her speech on that occasion, as reported at column 825 of the Official Report of 11 September 1997, she stated:</P>
    <P>Elaborate concealment through offshore accounts and other such devices is a recognition both by the donors and the recipients of the impropriety of what they are doing.  Those complex financial webs were obviously woven to evade tax.</P>
    <P>She went on to state: &ldquo;The terms of reference proposed for the new tribunal are as comprehensive and well-drafted as they can be.&rdquo; She knows from her own investigations and from the information that emerged that they are not drafted as widely, comprehensively and well as she said they were in September.  It is now time for her to push the Taoiseach to accept this motion.  She should use her power as a partner in Government and ensure she does not hide behind section 19 of the Companies Act in this investigation.  Sections 19, 20 and 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, make it clear that the investigation being carried out by the Tánaiste will not lead to disclosure of the <Col N="629" /> people who have been using these offshore accounts to evade tax or to breach exchange controls. It states that the reports and the information gathered cannot be made public.  It is difficult to ascertain the reason the Tánaiste is hiding behind the Act she is charged with the responsibility to implement.  Naturally when there is silence as to why the Government will not allow these Ansbacher accounts to be examined by the tribunal there will be rumour and innuendo. That is not good.  I do not know if the Government has had second thoughts about this and whether it will vote down this motion in a bullheaded way.  I hope the Independents who are being mollycoddled and minded by the Government will show their strength.  One reporter made a plea to one of the Independents to make a name in this House.  They should have the courage the Ministers, Deputies McCreevy and Harney, were purported to have over the years which made them such household names. The Independents should have the courage to vote with the Opposition on this motion and send a message to the Government that the politicians elected to this House want to see any wrongdoing exposed.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Noonan put to rest the attempts by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and Government spokespersons, publicly and in private briefings, to besmirch the name of Fine Gael to the effect that we did not want to amend the terms of reference last September.  We did and the evidence to prove that is in the Official Report.  We voted to make sure that these Ansbacher accounts were examined to ensure that if there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of tax evasion that it would have to be examined in public. The terms of reference allow the judge to examine all issues in private and on finding information that requires public consideration to proceed with that.  The Minister of State who is present was a member of the Progressive Democrats. He jumped ship and for the moment he seems to be staying in the arms of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should get up to speed.  Has she nothing new to add?  That remark is pathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister of State has not seen the wisdom of this motion from the point of view of how it will benefit the party of which he is a member in ensuring there is no criticism of it.  If the Government does not accept this motion, it will be shown to have made the wrong decision and in a few months' time it will have to reconsider what it did in voting it down.  It will have to come back to this matter and set up another tribunal or extend this tribunal's terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the tribunal continues its work, public pressure will be such that the Government will have to examine the Ansbacher accounts.  Whatever about there being any excuse last September for the Government to vote down amendments <Col N="630" /> put forward by the Opposition, if it wanted any further indication that there is a need for it to have the courage to accept this Opposition motion, that is indicated by the more recent information about the National Irish Bank and the alleged accusations that approximately 180 to 200 people have used offshore accounts to evade tax.</P>
    <P>It is not a sign of weakness for a Government to accept an Opposition amendment.  When we were on the benches opposite for two and a half years there were many occasions when Deputy Bruton as Taoiseach was willing to accept the Opposition's opinion on matters.  We accepted amendments to many Bills.  We did not think that was weakness on our part but rather the way parliamentary democracy is supposed to work.</P>
    <P>If the Government is worried that if it accepts this motion it will appear to be backtracking on something it did not do last September, it should not be afraid.  It will receive the thanks of the public for having the courage to accept the collective advice and wisdom of the Opposition parties that the tribunal's terms of reference should be amended before it becomes deeply involved in its work.  It will be a bad day for our democracy and for all Members if the Government is seen to vote down this motion.  Pushing through its amendment by giving three Independents something special to keep them quite for the day or giving them a pairing arrangement and allowing them to go off down the country is not the way to run this democracy.</P>
    <P>The public expect this matter to be examined. They will not be satisfied with what the Minister, Deputy Harney, is doing because the examination under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, will not be sufficient to ensure people who have abused the mechanism of offshore accounts will be brought to justice and exposed.  It is not just the politicians who should be exposed.  Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry who have been the subject of the McCracken tribunal have done wrong and they must be exposed, but we must also ensure that leading people here who have made money and who may also be responsible for creating jobs cannot break the law at the expense of others.  They are obliged to pay taxes like every other person, from those who earn £11,000 per annum or £12,000 per annum to those who earn six figure sums or more.  I hope, even at this eleventh hour, that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will give a message to the Government that they must support this motion.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest and in amazement to the remarks of Deputy Noonan and Deputy Owen.  I reject the central tenet of their argument that the Government is trying to hide the truth.  Nothing could be further from the truth and, irrespective of their desire to make legitimate Opposition points &mdash; Deputy Noonan made some reasonable comments &mdash; it is grossly wrong of the Deputies to suggest otherwise.  Their <Col N="631" /> arguments were spoiled by the concluding remarks of Deputy Owen in particular.</P>
      <P>We should be clear about the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal.  The former Taoiseach is present and he is aware the Government received strong legal opinion that it would be extremely foolish to interfere with the terms of reference as originally set.  Is it the basis of the Opposition's argument that when tribunals are established in the future and other matters emerge after the terms of reference are set, Members can table motions in the House to amend the terms of reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if they are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be a shred of credibility attached to any future tribunal in those circumstances.  This also applies to the current tribunal which has an enormous amount of work to carry out.  It would be a bad day's work if that was the basis of tribunals established by the House.</P>
      <P>The Government believes the position is sacrosanct once the terms of reference of a tribunal have been set.  Once people become involved with a tribunal, they should not be subject to the whims of Members of the House who attempt to change the terms of reference and the original criteria of the investigation because other factors emerge.  The consequences of the factors will be dealt with once a tribunal has concluded and its report is available.  It may be necessary to take other action and the appropriate steps will be taken at that stage.  The Government is intent on ensuring that the truth of these issues is made available to the public.  That will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies referred to the Companies Act as if it were Mickey Mouse legislation. The Deputies are former Ministers and Deputy Noonan spent much time over many years putting in place the Companies Act to ensure the work carried out by the inspectors would achieve results.  The current investigation, instituted by the Tánaiste, has already achieved results.  The powers under the Act are having the required effect.  I reject the suggestion that the Government has taken a dismissive approach to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister last night on the Adjournment spelt out the measures being taken, including the action under insurance law taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy.  The Tánaiste has also acted under the Companies Acts to investigate possible breaches of those Acts.  There is no intention on the Government's part to shield wrongdoers from publicity.  However, we must strike a balance.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide if further powers should be given to the Revenue Commissioners and others.  This is a <Col N="632" /> matter of judging what promotes the public good and what will be effective in doing so.  This judgment is best made when all the evidence is available from the Moriarty tribunal, the company inquiries and the ongoing examinations by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank of the latest allegations.</P>
    <P>These investigations are in place and all the powers under the law are being examined.  The full rigours of the law are being brought to bear. The Fine Gael Party in particular appears to think that we should abandon course midway and add new terms of reference.  It wants to change the criteria to deal with emerging facts.  However, these facts will be covered by the different areas to which I referred.  If any other matters arise which require further investigation by any other means, the Government will ensure they are investigated and the public is made aware of the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday that I believed the Government was sincere in its views on opposing a change.  I did not believe there was any malicious or malevolent purpose in its approach and that it genuinely believed the legal advice it received.  However, having listened to one of the worst speeches ever from a Minister for Finance on any topic, I have changed my mind.  Having listened to the Minister for Finance's superficial address, and although it goes against the grain, I have formed the view that perhaps there is another agenda at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  It is grossly unfair of the Deputy to suggest it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not conceive that a Minister, who was well prepared for a debate which he knew for several weeks would be held, could prepare such a bad, poorly argued and poorly founded speech.  That makes me suspicious.</P>
      <P>The Government spokesman originally stated that the terms of reference could not be extended.  However, the Minister for Finance slightly modified it yesterday and suggested that probably they could not be extended but if they could, it would not be a good idea.  It is surprising in itself that the Government has such imprecise understanding of its legal advice.  I wish to state categorically that the terms of reference of a tribunal in being can be amended by the House.</P>
      <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921, refers to the terms of reference of a tribunal being contained either in the resolution establishing it or in a supplemental instrument.  This means there could be an instrument to supplement the terms of reference of a tribunal.  This is stated in the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921.  The amendment of terms of reference was envisaged in the principal legislation approved in 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of this tribunal require it in its interim report to address the question of other matters which could be dealt with, including the terms of reference explicitly mentioned.  What <Col N="633" /> was the point of including in the remit of the tribunal the possibility of referring to its terms of reference in an interim report if it was not with a view to remedying any deficiencies which might exist in the terms of reference?  If the deficiencies were remedied, the only way it could be done would be by an amendment to the terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal contain material evidence to suggest that the Minister is wrong in saying that it is not possible to amend the terms of reference.  They envisage the possibility of the terms of reference being amended.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister for Finance did not say yesterday that he had consulted Mr. Justice Moriarty about this matter.  On a previous occasion when the Government argued that the terms of reference of another tribunal could not be altered, it received public advice from its chairman, Mr. Justice McCracken, that he did not want the terms of reference amended.  It is interesting on this occasion that the Minister did not refer to consulting Mr. Justice Moriarty.  He did not say that Mr. Justice Moriarty had advised against amending the terms of reference or that the Chief State Solicitor had consulted the legal team advising Mr. Justice Moriarty.  If the Government was confident in its view that a term of reference could not be altered, it would have sought to obtain the advice of the tribunal itself on the matter.  However, it did not do so.  This is evidence that the Government knew if it did so it would not receive the answer it sought.  They would not get an answer from Mr. Justice Moriarty to the effect that he objected to an amendment to the terms of reference.  It was very significant that the Minister for Finance did not refer to consulting the tribunal about this when he spoke.  The absence of such a reference is evidence of potential bad faith on the Minister's part in his approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also wrong in law when he stated that terms of reference cannot be amended.  Apart from the reasons I have already given, I have consulted foreign authorities on this subject.  The common law jurisdiction which has had tribunals most frequently is Australia.  The authoritative Australian book on that subject is &ldquo;Royal Commissions and Boards of Inquiry: Some Legal and Procedural Aspects&rdquo; by Leonard Arthur Hallett.  I refer the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General to page 55, which clearly states that terms of reference in that common law country, where the law is the same as here, can be amended.  Mr. Hallett cites evidence in support of that view, and the Minister for Finance is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that the Minister did not produce the legal advice he received.  He referred mysteriously to legal advice but did not produce it.  There are precedents for the legal advice of Attorneys General being produced.  When Mr. John Murray was Attorney General his advice on a matter was produced in the House.  However, the Minister for Finance did not care to produce <Col N="634" /> Mr. David Byrne's legal advice on the matter, possibly because that advice is not as categorical as the political statements being made by the Minister in the House.  Having listened to him, I have serious doubts about the integrity of the Government's approach on this matter.  I say that having stated, before I heard the Minister, that I believed he was acting in good faith.  I am not so sure now I have heard the very bad speech he made.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to hide behind the fact that the terms of reference already contain a term which requires it to report on how the State's tax base might be protected from fraud or evasion through the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts as well as recommending changes to that end.  How is that tribunal to reach a meaningful conclusion on that when it is not allowed to investigate tax evasion?  It is not possible for the tribunal to make a recommendation on how to deal with tax evasion if it is not allowed to investigate tax evasion.  One cannot discover how much tax evasion there is unless one investigates the actions of individuals.  The Minister says the tribunal should investigate tax evasion and make recommendations on that.  He also says the tribunal cannot investigate individuals who have evaded tax.  That is a contradiction in terms.  It is not possible for a tribunal to make any recommendation about tax evasion unless it investigates individual cases to discover what methods were used.  The Government's refusal to accept the Opposition amendment renders null and void one of the existing terms of the Moriarty tribunal and prevents that tribunal from fulfilling the provisions of paragraph <i>p.</i> The tribunal is being prevented from getting the relevant information needed to make a recommendation on the matter.</P>
    <P>A large amount of money passes through overseas accounts.  I recently read a United Nations report on how the drugs trade is maintained, and it identified the use of offshore accounts as a way of laundering drug money.  It drew attention to the fact that the banking deposits in the Cayman Islands are almost as large as the banking deposits in Germany.  This little piece of desert in the Caribbean has a bank deposit base as big as Germany's.  All but five of the 100 banks there have no residential existence in the Cayman Islands.  It is a place used for paper transactions to evade inquiry.  Action must be taken, or the tax base of all civilised states will be destroyed in the next ten to 15 years.  These tax havens are international pirates which prey on the ability of civilised states to provide decent services for people.  Unless they are dealt with, we will not be able to control the drugs trade.  We will not be able to maintain the capacity of states to function because sophisticated information technology, such as the Internet, will be used to extend the type of systematic tax evasion now being availed of by a few favoured customers of some banks.  It will be made available to the broad mass of people to evade tax.  This is a very serious issue <Col N="635" /> facing democratic States and could lead to the nation-State being undermined as a fiscally viable entity if it is not dealt with.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Noonan's suggestions are true, then it is not simply a question of the managing director of National Irish Bank committing a crime. Everybody involved in selling that financial scam committed a crime.  There is a clear obligation on anybody aware of tax evasion to bring it to the attention of the authorities.</P>

      <P>This matter should be considered very carefully.  If the facts as stated are true, those involved are promoting tax evasion and crime.  It is important that the law be seen to apply at every level.  We do not want people to make the claim that they were only obeying orders.  The law clearly states that everyone has an obligation as a citizen to report such malfeasance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the Tánaiste's inquiry cannot be published or be referred to the Moriarty tribunal. Deputy O'Malley seemed to suggest it could, but <Col N="636" /> it cannot.  Section 19 binds the Minister to keep it confidential other than giving the results to specified persons, and the tribunal is not one of those specified.  If the Tánaiste wanted to give the tribunal the report or the tribunal asked for it, it cannot be given.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that the tribunal report could be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I remind Deputy Cullen of what happened when the beef tribunal report was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. This issue cannot wait for the long, turgid and doubtful process the Tánaiste has set in motion. I do not criticise her; Deputy O'Malley appeared to defend her against attacks which had not been made against her.  I believe the Tánaiste has done all she can as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment, but she has not done all she can as a member of the Government. In that capacity she should have argued for the acceptance of this motion.  This is a quicker, more open and more effective way of dealing with the issue.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ridiculous that appeals to An Bord Pleanála are treated equally regardless of the area from which they emanate.  A person who lives on Malin Head, for example, can object to a development in Dublin and his or her objection will be given equal treatment with an objection from somebody who lives beside the proposed development in Dublin.  We have lost sight of that aspect of the process.  Is it also true that an EU citizen can lodge an objection to a development in Ireland with An Bord Pleanála, even though the person lives outside the jurisdiction?  It has come to my notice that a number of commercial entities are objecting to developments with the sole intention of obstructing them for their own commercial advantage.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála is central to this Bill.  In 1998 the Minister can increase the number of ordinary members of the board from five to seven.  A quorum of three members is required for all board meetings.  Will the increase in the number of board members mean an increase in the number of members required for a quorum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the unwieldy system in An Bord Pleanála at present, decision making is slow and cumbersome, despite the improvements of recent years.  I do not oppose the power of the Minister to make appointments.  However, having made his decision on receipt of the nominations from the four nominating groups, it might be useful if he gave reasons for appointing the nominees &mdash; whether it was because the person concerned had planning expertise or an engineering background or a local authority background.  Such a simple <Col N="641" /> explanation would suffice as we need not be too concerned about the people appointed to the board.  An addendum to the appointment decision should include the reason the Minister chose to appoint the person to the board.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that inspectors' reports are often thrown out after they have been sent to the board.  That is not healthy.  The board should give its reasons for deciding to countravene the inspectors' report, which in effect emanates from technical people who have expertise in planning, engineering and so forth.</P>
    <P>One could say a great deal more about this issue.  I welcome the Bill.  The increase in the number of board members will, I hope, lead to more efficient and effective use of the board's time.  Anything that can be done in that regard should have the support of all parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for sharing his time with me.  This Bill is welcome.  It seeks to address delays in the planning system by extending the membership of An Bord Pleanála. That extension should also be applied to the inspectorate by increasing the number of inspectors. There is a huge workload in the planning process which, among other reasons, is due to the economic boom and the increasing willingness of people to exercise their democratic right of appeal.  However, the board's time should not be taken up with frivolous appeals.  Appeals against planning decisions which do not contravene plans for an area should not be allowed to proceed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>A number of Members have referred to inspectors' reports which have been thrown out by An Bord Pleanála.  I agree with their sentiments. There should be openness and transparency in the decisions of the board and it should be required to explain why it rejected an inspector's report or rejected an appeal.  There must be confidence in the planning system and the decisions by An Bord Pleanála.  That has not been the case in a number of instances.</P>
      <P>One such instance is Cork Harbour where the ESB applied for planning permission to install 22 kilometres of overhead cables and pylons.  It has been dubbed the &ldquo;ring of steel&rdquo; around the harbour. There were many local objections to the plan but Cork County Council gave planning permission. The permission was appealed by local residents to An Bord Pleanála.  A petition signed by 6,000 residents in the area was forwarded to the board.  They objected to the granting of planning permission but the board did not see fit to hold an oral hearing on the matter.  That decision has become a contentious issue in the area and is the subject of great local interest and concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Harbour area depends on tourism and a number of luxury liners visit Cork regularly. The appearance of the harbour will not be helped by the installation of a ring of steel around Cobh and Cork Harbour.  I do not wish to condemn the development outright but there must <Col N="642" /> be another way to install cables in the area.  The contention in Cork is that cables should be provided underground.  I believe that is possible and it should be investigated, although the ESB has rejected it as being too expensive.  A figure of £20 million was mentioned.  In 20 years' time, my children will look at this ring of steel and will ask questions about it because the way money is devaluing £20 million will not be very significant then.  This permission is unsustainable and should be looked at in that light.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues regarding planning and the speed at which decisions are reached.  I know this Bill tries to address the speed at which planning applications are dealt with and appoints more members to An Bord Pleanála for that purpose.  That is right.  If it is said a decision will be made within four months, everything in the power of the authorities should be done to grant decisions within that timeframe.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also pay attention to the notion of fast track planning.  The idea is that tracts of land would be identified and zoned for industrial or commercial development with planning permission for the lands being given in advance of the development.  There is no doubt that a number of major developments in Cork and other areas have been deterred by the lengthy planning process.  My proposal would have the various stages of the planning process dealt with prior to the company coming to Cork or any other area.  This would mean the preparation of environmental impact statements would be carried out at an earlier stage.  This works well in areas of the UK.  Siemens said one of its reasons for locating in the UK instead of here was the lengthy planning process.  It is something which should be addressed.  We should not interfere with the democratic planning process, but it could be curtailed and the fact that it takes a long time for companies and individuals to obtain planning permission, especially given the long lead-in time where appeals may be lodged, should be addressed.  These statutory zones would be subject to consultation with local people and local development.  They would be given special designation and details of planning, such as the types of buildings and the number of windows in them and the number of car park spaces, would be dealt with before companies invested in the area.</P>
    <P>We have an open, democratic planning system. Not many countries have boards like An Bord Pleanála, which is independent and suits our democratic needs.  It is welcome, but it should also be given assistance to deal with the large volume of work it is experiencing at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill which I welcome for two reasons.  First, it aims to help overcome what has become one of the many bottlenecks in planning.  Second, it gives us an opportunity to say something about the whole planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my firm belief that Ireland's planning process is at a crossroads at present.  Scandals, <Col N="643" /> rumours of scandals, inconsistent decisions, delays in issuing planning decisions, delays in handling appeals, irrational and sometimes completely inexplicable decisions added to the poor completion of estates and failures to deal with non-compliant builders all contribute to a lack of public confidence in the planning process which I suggest is now escalating to the point where there is something of a crisis of confidence in planning. I welcome the proposals in the Bill as they will help to remove a bottleneck in An Bord Pleanála. It is to be hoped that they will provide a degree of flexibility in that regard.  However, it is my belief that we must go much further than this Bill if we are to address the already evident and abundant problems in planning.  What we need at this stage is a root and branch overhaul and examination of the entire planning process, including how it is controlled and how it operates.</P>
    <P>The health of the economy and the related boom in the building industry are very welcome. Irish builders have been through a long dry period where they had to lay off staff, where some very respectable companies went out of business and where margins were very thin.  I welcome the change which has come about.  It is about time they had better prospects.  The boom times bring their own challenges, not just for builders but also for planners, house buyers and the community in general.  In this debate we are discussing the problems in planning.  The Bill aims to assist An Bord Pleanála with its work and that is very welcome. There are other planning pressures which are very evident, especially in the major urban areas and they also need the attention of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>The upturn in building and development has placed a strain on planning departments in councils. Every Member could point to a problem in some planning department within their constituencies. The strain has four obvious manifestations. First and most obvious is the delay in processing planning applications at local authority level.  Second is the very serious delays which are now beginning to occur in the production of development plans in the urban and county areas. The third major problem concerns the controlling of development, with the result that there has been a regrettable re-emergence of a range of rogue developers who are now causing major problems, especially for young home owners.  The fourth problem has been the extraordinary escalation in development charges in a number of councils.  There is a need to investigate some of these charges because it is evident that some local authorities are using development charges as a form of tax to bring in general revenue not necessarily associated with the developments in question.</P>
    <P>Delays in dealing with planning applications are becoming a major problem in all areas, but particularly so in major urban areas.  This is most evident in the case of Dublin and the surrounding counties.  As a result of the near chaos in planning <Col N="644" /> in some areas, a second factor has entered the picture: the rise in litigation and judicial reviews relating to planning.  Judicial reviews have now become a major feature of the Irish planning process. In County Wicklow, for example, the county council had an increase in excess of 20 per cent in planning applications in 1997 over 1996, which itself was up 10 per cent on the previous year. The council has also been involved in a number of spectacular judicial reviews, some of which would not have occurred if the council had adopted a less confrontational approach to some of the planning activities before it.  The huge cost of reviews and the rise in planning applications has resulted in crisis management.  Planning applications are long-fingered as a matter of routine. Council staff increasingly resort to last minute decisions, some of which are ill-considered, or alternatively, put back the evil day on which they must make a decision by requesting further information. All this has had its impact on public confidence.</P>
    <P>Public confidence has been further undermined by the delays in producing development plans. The excuse and explanation, which is reasonable, is that councils simply do not have the staff to produce them.  Many councils are operating on plans which we know to be out of date which in itself is causing major difficulties.  It means <i>ad hoc</i> approaches must be adopted, especially in areas where planning pressures are at their greatest. There have been recent first hand examples of the consequence of this in County Wicklow.  For example, the new zoning of Blessington was agreed by the council in the teeth of huge opposition from the public and me and a number of other councillors.  This resistance was not mere NIMBYism but was from people who wished to protect a unique environment.  The irony of the Glen Ding case is that a landowner who attempted to build a house for a son or daughter on the hills concerned would have properly been refused permission.  The same council has carried out a complete and inexcusable turnabout on its previous position and has given permission to remove the hills.</P>
    <P>A number of Wicklow councillors have added insult to injury by rezoning a significant amount of land in the vicinity of Blessington's industrial estate for further housing.  This was done despite housing staff advice that it was unnecessary.  This was dealt with in a fine judgment last week in the High Court.  However, it does not help to build public confidence in the planning process.</P>
    <P>The third problem is the major failure in planning control.  This is adding to the erosion of public confidence yet it is on the increase and requires urgent attention.  Regrettably, we are seeing the re-emergence of that most unwelcome phenomenon &mdash; the rogue builder.  The tragedy is that the few bad apples in the building industry are causing problems for communities, new house buyers and decent builders who wish to comply with regulations and try to give good value for money.  These decent builders are being tarred <Col N="645" /> with the same brush.  This problem undermines public confidence.  It is creating additional problems for councils who do not have the staff to ensure that builders meet every detail of the planning conditions.  A major part of the problem is that councils are not capable of implementing any kind of inspection of developments.  Too frequently, councils lack staff.  In some cases there is also a question mark over their willingness to take on the big issue of compliance.</P>
    <P>The situation is dreadfully unjust, not only for people who buy the houses and buildings and have to live work in them.  It is also unfair on decent builders who try to comply with the conditions and meet all the costs of development while others get away with cutting corners and leaving the costs to be met by someone else &mdash; local taxpayers and local authorities which are already strapped for cash.  When estates are not finished properly, or where major problems emerge three or four years after an estate is handed over, the local authority has to add to such bonds and securities which exist to carry out the work which should have been done in the first instance by the developers.  Regrettably, there are more than sufficient case studies on this problem in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The most exasperating aspect of this problem is the number of times that the same rogue builders appear on the list of problem makers.  Last month I wrote a letter to the county manager accompanied by seven pages of complaints concerning a well-highlighted estate in Wicklow town.  I also sent a letter with a further four pages of complaints to the same council about another estate in the same town built by the same builder. Yesterday I wrote a letter to the council and to Homebond regarding a third estate in the same town by the same builder.  How is this allowed to happen?  Home owners on these estates and those who care about good development are asking how it is that builders with a history of leaving devastation behind them are given planning permission. It is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>In one estate in Wicklow town 15 people who occupied brand new houses in the last 12 months are contemplating legal action.  This is grotesquely unfair.  It is particularly unfair when other estates are being built in the same area by builders who are scrupulously attempting to meet the terms and responsibilities of their planning permission.  It is unfair to a council which is grossly understaffed.  We do not have the personnel to carry out the scrupulous inspection which is needed.  This is a serious issue, not just for the Minister and local authorities, but for bodies such as the Construction Industry Federation.  The CIF, Homebond and other professional bodies must have an interest in becoming pro-active in ensuring that home buyers get value for money and that estates are not left unfinished by rogue builders in a way which brings the entire industry into disrepute.  The Minister should examine this matter.  He should bar those with a bad record from being allowed to increment that bad record <Col N="646" /> by further irresponsible development in other estates.</P>
    <P>Development charges is the final issue which is causing grave concern in my area and others.  It is important that when a development goes ahead the economic costs are not transferred to general taxation or to the local authority.  There is evidence that a number of local authorities are escalating development charges to the point where they are funding other council activities which should be funded by introducing substantial taxes on home ownership.  I mentioned the case of land which was imprudently rezoned last year in Blessington town.  Wicklow County Council subsequently gave planning permission for an estate on that land but placed a development cost of £6,700 on each house being built.  This charge is against the future development costs of the town. It is a substantial level of taxation.  If the Minister for Finance had announced in his December budget that he was going to place a tax of £6,000 &mdash; £7,000 on every new house being built he would not have lasted the day.  If he had not been dealt with by the Opposition he would have been lynched by his own side.</P>
    <P>A ludicrous situation has developed in recent weeks in that Wicklow County Council has given three individuals in Greystones town individual planning permission to build in gardens of existing houses.  However, the council added development charges of £6,700 where there was no justifiable argument for such large development costs. This makes it impossible for young couples to house themselves, forcing them on to local authority housing lists which are already problematic. This must be examined.</P>
    <P>It is also ludicrous that a huge development will take place in Greystones where everyone knows that there are no facilities.  The roads cannot accommodate the additional population.  The council is resolving this problem by placing development charges of approximately £7,000 on each house.  This is with a view to creating a fund to build roads.  This is the antithesis of good planning. We need to put in place plans for the infrastructure before people are allowed in.  Putting in the population in the hope that one might get the money for the infrastructure in the long term is not the way forward.</P>
    <P>This is welcome legislation.  The Minister is making prudent provision to improve matters in An Bord Pleanála.  However, there is a disquieting abundance of evidence that the planning system is in chaos.  It is very fine to stand in the House and describe the problems.  However, it is incumbent upon us to prescribe some remedies. For example, on the issue of repeated rogue development, there is an unanswerable case for looking at the planning law to find a way of disbarring people who have continually failed to meet their responsibilities, whether in the guise of corporate structures or as individuals.  I wish to see the planning laws punishing the rogues.  The vast majority of builders I have dealt with are decent people who try to do their best.  However, <Col N="647" /> the industry is being brought into disrepute by a handful of rogues who, because they can undercut and move from place to place, are making big profits and passing on the costs of their behaviour to young couples, communities, councils who cannot afford it, and ultimately the national taxpayer. The second measure I would like to see at an early stage is an investigation into the impact on planning staff, particularly in the areas which are growing most rapidly.  It is important to keep a tight rein on the growth of public service numbers, but something must be done to alleviate the problems of councils, such as Wicklow County Council and Bray Urban District Council, where there is a burgeoning of pressure.</P>
    <P>Special funding arrangements will have to be put in place to create the necessary infrastructure to support present as well as additional future populations in the greater Dublin area and in other urban areas.  The population of towns such as Greystones doubled and trebled in size in the 1970s and 1980s but there was no investment in roads.  It is extraordinary that the population of Greystones grew from under 4,000 in 1971 to approximately 11,000 at present while in the same period Wicklow County Council had funds to build only 12 feet of roadway.  The remainder was either done by private developers or was left to fall into chaos.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently announced the welcome addition of £15 million to provide support for councils which wish to bring onstream land otherwise incapable of development.  I would like to see an extension of that fund and its tailoring for areas where there are additional pressures.  This does not only concern the east coast.  The Minister of State will be aware of the situation in the vicinity of Galway where there has been a welcome expansion of good quality development.</P>
    <P>The problems I have outlined are not unique to County Wicklow, but are to be found in every constituency and planning area in the country. The problems need to be addressed as soon as possible because we will all suffer if the public lose further confidence in the planning process. The signs of erosion are already present and this and other measures which the Minister will hopefully bring forward will address the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned about the delays in making a decision on appeals and I am sure everybody in the House welcomes the legislation as it attempts to speed up the process by appointing more members to the board.  I hope the appointment of additional members will lead to the employment of additional staff because a <Col N="648" /> delay of four months can be most frustrating for many people.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to know if An Bord Pleanála makes any attempt to discern between genuine objectors &mdash; those who feel they have a grievance &mdash; and cranks who make appeals for ulterior motives.  A number of crank appeals are made and it would be a much speedier process if that distinction could be made.</P>
      <P>Only one in ten appeals are successful.  I always try to dissuade constituents who have been refused planning permission and who are talking about appealing a decision to An Bord Pleanála from doing so.  I advise them to try to resolve the matter with the local authority as the chances of being successful in appealing to An Bord Pleanála are one in ten.  It is better to meet with the planner and work out an accommodation.  Many people would not appeal to the board if they were aware that only one in ten appeals are successful.</P>
      <P>It is time the planning process was overhauled and that we started again from scratch.  Planning permission has been necessary from the mid-1960s; I think the planning Act dates to 1964 or 1965 but it did not come into effect until 1967 and it should now be overhauled.  The planning system has been circumvented and abused.  I am in favour of devolving more power to local authorities, but I have grave reservations about the law when I seen certain local authorities making regular use of section 4 to bulldoze through planning applications which the planners do not think are desirable.  It is time to draw up new legislation and to get rid of section 4 if it is impinging on proper planning and development.</P>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the prevention of continuous building to the detriment of green spaces is flawed.  Green belts and the desirable green areas can be eliminated on a systematic basis through rezoning.  This is terribly wrong and I do not know why Governments and Ministers over the past 30 years have allowed this to happen. There was a better planning system in operation under British rule when green spaces were created; this is very evident in our larger cities. In Dublin we have the magnificent St. Stephen's Green and Merrion Park.  Outside the city centre we have Herbert Park in Ballsbridge and on the north side there is a fine park in Fairview and St. Anne's Park.  The Phoenix Park is the largest. Dublin Corporation is reasonably well able to cater for people who need recreation, sporting and leisure facilities.</P>
      <P>Much of the crime in the country is related to the non-existence of recreational facilities and amenities.  This can be seen in parts of the inner city.  I am not here to criticise the Taoiseach, but a group of people from the Summerhill area, who live in the shadow of Croke Park and have no facilities whatsoever, protested at the granting of £20 million in the budget to the GAA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who passes through the area must agree that the residents have a pertinent case.  There is much crime and deprivation in that general area, the roots of which may be found in the lack of amenities and facilities.  I have made this point here before but I am beginning to think I am talking to the wall.</P>
      <P>I often wonder what the Green Party stands for on the issues of planning, conservation of open spaces and provision of amenities and facilities. For every pound provided by the Government for local authority housing and for every pound spent by private developers, a matching pound should be spent on amenities and recreational facilities. I would like that concept to be taken on board by the Minister and the Government.  The current planning system is not merely crazy, it is wrong.</P>
      <P>Local authorities in provincial towns are the biggest offenders.  They start building in the centre of a town and build solidly out to its outskirts. I see that happening in my own town of Dungarvan and I am sure the situation there is typical of what is happening throughout the country.  This practice is allowed because nobody gives a damn. The way in which the money is allocated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the manner in which officials are under its whip results in local authorities building, building and building.</P>
      <P>There should be restrictions on where building can or cannot take place.  At the moment we are building solidly and there are no open spaces available.  However, if I, or some other Member raises this issue, we are told the GAA, rugby club or soccer club have a field in a particular area. People will even point to the grounds of a local convent as being a green area.  However, all of those places are private property.</P>
      <P>Local authorities might build 116 or 250 houses in an area.  In Ballybeg, in Waterford city, 1,000 houses have been built and in Knocknaheeny in Cork 2,000 houses have probably been built.  In Neilstown or Ronanstown in Tallaght, up to ten thousand houses have probably been built. However, facilities were not provided in all of the massive estates which were built in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
      <P>People wonder why we have a culture of joyriders, drugs and drink but the reasons are obvious.  Concrete jungles are being built and no attempt has been made by successive Governments to enable development in an organised and civilised manner.  People will point out that there are 50 or 100 acres of green land in Ballybeg, Neilstown, Ronanstown or wherever but that land is populated by stray horses and has not been developed for recreational or amenity purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an incredible lack of thought or care in planning.  To a major extent, that lack of compassionate, reasonable planning is responsible for the current crime crisis.  I urge the Minister and the Government to respond to this problem.  I would like the Green Party to tell us what it stands for and I would like environmentalists to <Col N="650" /> inform us of their concerns.  Nobody seems to be concerned about the provision of proper planning. It is appalling that there is no organised system for the provision of green spaces.  The planning laws should be revamped, public green spaces mapped out and the law should be drafted to make it impossible for green spaces to be rezoned for building purposes.  They should be used solely for amenities and recreation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 should be abolished if it is seen to impede the orderly development of our society. I hope the planning tribunal, examining alleged abuses of the planning system, will find out the truth.  If what we hear on the grapevine about corruption in this area is true, I hope that is proven and there will not be another massive cover up.  I am sure the tribunal will do its best and I hope if corruption exists, it will find hard evidence to prove it.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years, planning laws have not been developed in an orderly way.  Prior to that, planning laws did not exist and it was possible to erect any sort of a building.  The planning laws instituted in the mid 1960s have not worked.  They have defeated the purpose for which they were intended.</P>
    <P>Solid building on every available inch or square yard of green space must stop.  A green belt should remain a green belt.  If, when rezoning occurs, people must be compensated with millions of pounds if their land cannot be built upon, we must change the law to prevent that happening. The present planning laws are incapable of delivering the orderly development of land.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the erection of masts throughout the country.  Being a physics graduate I have some knowledge about radiation although I am not an expert in the field.  The level of objection to the erection of masts has got out of control and the response of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and of local authorities has not been sufficient.  The Minister should set up an expert group to advise on the dangers or otherwise of radiation from the various masts being constructed?</P>

      <P>I am not taking issue with the Minister on this, I merely want to be reasonable in my approach.  The people objecting most are &ldquo;head-the-balls&rdquo;. In my experience most of these masts are totally innocuous and pose no danger whatsoever to health but I would like an expert group to confirm that.  One is exposed to considerably greater levels of radiation by sitting in front of a television for a half an hour than if one lives adjacent to an aerial on the top of a mountain or on the top of a roof.  However, I do not believe aerials should be erected on the top of mountains.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>An expert group should be set up to advise people on the matter.  Today's newspapers carry reports of gardaí and their families objecting to the erection of masts in their back gardens and so on.</P>
      <P>Virtually all aerials are harmless.  Conversely, I would be concerned if a high tension power line passed by my house.  We are all aware of the effects of electro-magnetic fields generated by high tension cables.  They are a cause of concern, but masts are not a health problem.  The health authorities do not consider them a problem, but the public continue to protest about the matter.  I believe some are motivated by people with ulterior motives.  The masts may compete with a deflector system and those concerned want a monopoly on the money from television rights. There are all sorts of dirty tricks in this field.  The Minister for the Environment must set up a group that will inform people that radiation from masts is harmless.  That needs to be said strongly, loudly and more often.  The public is fair minded.  A small minority should not be allowed dictate to the majority.  That is what is happening in this case.  Pressure groups are playing hell with people and stopping desirable developments.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister good luck.  I hope the enlarged board is accompanied by more staff and that the system works more effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an attempt to remove the backlog of appeals with An Bord Pleanála.  It is a short-term solution.  The Bill and this debate present an opportunity to raise broad issues regarding An Bord Pleanála's role and the entire planning process.  There is an immediate need to examine the system which caused the backlog.  From a management point of view, there is no point in us examining the current position if we do not examine how the backlog occurred.  If the cause of the problem is not examined, it may escalate.  We owe it to the people we represent and to the planning system to carry out an examination of the planning sections of each local authority.</P>
      <P>Central to this issue, and something which would greatly increase the efficiency of the planning process, is the revitalisation and empowerment of local government, coupled with a root and branch review of its structures to ensure it is more cost effective, transparent and efficient.  The centralist policy which has been eroding the power of local government for generations &mdash; a legacy bequeathed to us by our former masters &mdash; was never democratic and has no place in today's world.  In taking powers from towns and cities it stole their pride and damaged the democratic process.  In this regard, I have watched with interest the direction being taken by the UK Government which is proposing to install elected mayors and executive cabinets in all major towns and cities because it regards the current decision-making process as cumbersome with obscure lines of accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" />&ldquo;Cumbersome&rdquo; and &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; are adjectives that can be easily applied to our planning regulations. It frequently becomes distant and uninformed when An Bord Pleanála is involved.  The planning procedure from local authority level upwards should be proactive and contain a central unit within the local authority structure to deal with all pre-planning queries.  The pre-planning query function should be separate from the section that deals with formal applications.  This would ensure greater scrutiny and understanding of the application and, from the developer's point of view, would ensure a greater understanding of the area concerned and how it should be developed.  To speed up the process, the section dealing with the application could be informed it has come through that process and, thus, part of the scrutiny would have been dealt with.  Such a measure would reduce significantly the number of refusals which end up with An Bord Pleanála. This proactive approach, coupled with the strategic management initiative, would result in a dramatic improvement in each county.</P>
    <P>Additional staff with varied qualifications are required in every local authority area.  I thought the local authority area with which I am familiar was unique in terms of the problems it is experiencing, but that is not the case.  Having listened to other speakers, it appears this is a countrywide problem.  Specific action would result in a more efficient system.  As evident from the previous speaker's contribution, the problems in each county are basically the same.  A pre-planning query system is necessary.  In many cases there are desperate requests for further information at the last minute, thus further delaying the processing of applications and frustrating those who submit them.  Some of the applications are submitted by young couples wanting to build houses while others are submitted by people who would create employment in the areas concerned.  Even people who submit applications for developments in industrial estates are being frustrated.  They cannot understand why it takes so long to process a normal standard application for an area zoned for industrial use.</P>
    <P>Requests by local authorities to applicants, through a public representative or directly from an official, for further time to consider applications is a clear indication that the entire system is under enormous pressure.  Local authorities are unable to deal with the huge number of applications before them arising from our improved economic conditions.  We cannot ignore this.  This legislation highlights the need to deal with the unsatisfactory position that prevails in almost every local authority area.</P>
    <P>Other issues are relevant to the planning sections of local authorities, for example, the provision of green areas.  Most developers will meet the criteria laid down by setting aside a percentage of the land as a green area but this generally turns out to be a cosmetic exercise and the area cannot be used by the young families growing up <Col N="653" /> in the area.  We must ensure that sufficient green space is made available.</P>
    <P>If permission is granted for large housing developments, which are taking place in many areas, there should be a mechanism whereby the local authority can provide the infrastructural needs as the area is being developed and not afterwards.  It is only by making such a provision and insisting that every local authority carries out proper planning in this regard that we will achieve a reduction in social problems in the growing areas around our cities.</P>
    <P>Masts and ESB pylons were referred to by other speakers but I will not go into the related health issues.  However, too many of these masts are being imposed on communities.  In County Kilkenny such masts take from the beauty and the tourism potential of the area.  They are a blight on the countryside and if we wish to promote the tourism potential of County Kilkenny we must do something about these masts.  This refers not just to the telecommunications masts of the Garda or telephone companies, but also to the ESB pylons.  We must ensure that the lines from pylons, which are dangerous to health, are put underground and if necessary we must legislate to achieve this.</P>
    <P>One of the hallmarks of the tiger economy has been the false fronted buildings which are appearing around the country.  The fronts of heritage buildings are propped up and the remainder are torn down.  In doing so the souls of the buildings are destroyed.  Indeed, the souls of many towns and cities are destroyed when these buildings are torn down, roads are realigned and corners are cut.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Jim Gibbons.  He was a fine politician and gentleman.  It was Jim Gibbons and others of his ilk who led the crusade in Kilkenny to ensure the soul of our city and county was kept intact. People like him saved the city's heritage, as exemplified by Kilkenny Castle.</P>
    <P>However, 50 years after having saved the castle and established Kilkenny as a medieval city and a tourist attraction, An Bord Pleanála has taken a decision which will transform the centre of Kilkenny city driven by tax designation.  I do not say the tax designation policy is wrong and I am glad to see that it has been changed to take account of the social needs of an area.  However, in this case the local authority, driven and supported by local people, objected to the development only to be overruled by An Bord Pleanála. What business has An Bord Pleanála involving itself in overseeing the development of such a sensitive city?  How can towns and cities look after themselves and preserve their heritage which involve the consideration of issues which it would be impossible for An Bord Pleanála to include in its deliberations?  How can An Bord Pleanála take account of the love and affection for or the subliminal importance of a particular building and the understanding local people may have for it?  I do not believe it can.  These are <Col N="654" /> important issues which inform the decisions of local people, yet they cannot be taken on board by An Bord Pleanála in its deliberations because it is so remote from the efforts of local authorities and local people.  I suggest that some of An Bord Pleanála's decisions are based on inadequate information and understanding.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the level of care and attention being given to our ancient and historic buildings. I do not believe that the Office of Public Works, the semi-State and voluntary bodies have sufficient time, money or qualified staff to deal with the problems which are growing daily and as a result the planning laws are regularly ignored or avoided.  Historic buildings which are the subject of planning applications suddenly develop terminal diseases, JCBs and other heavy machinery take on lives of their own and, unbidden and driverless, destroy a site which is valuable in heritage terms.  Elements of our heritage disappear without trace and without notice every week as a result of the actions of people who seem driven by profit.</P>
    <P>Resources must be set aside to ensure that local authorities can provide the extra staff to police the conditions attached to the planning permissions granted.  If we do not take this action and if we allow the system to continue as it is we will destroy our towns and cities and the planning system itself because, without policing, there is virtually no need to add conditions to a permission. The issues of the density of housing and city apartments, the provision of green spaces and infrastructure must be examined urgently.  The Minister should undertake a complete review of the planning process to ensure transparency and to ensure it responds to the cases I have outlined. I support the Bill but I encourage further legislation.</P>

      <P>It is laughable to hear a contribution from a Fianna Fáil Member calling on the Government to recognise the plans of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to have mayors for London and other cities.  Over the last 60 or 70 years Fianna Fáil has sought to bring about weak local government.  Fianna Fáil centralised power and prevented local democracy from emerging.

      <P>My party should have taken a stronger line on this during the short periods it was in Government.  In Government I would try to develop real powers for local authorities.  The reason for the focus on the Dublin region is because people feared the capital city would have strong local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Seán Ryan of Fingal introduced a Planning and Development Bill before <Col N="655" /> Christmas.  It proposed simple reform of the planning procedures, one proposal being to refuse new planning permission to a rogue builder who left an estate in a mess having failed to honour the conditions of the planning permission granted by the local authority or An Bord Pleanála. However, despite requests for similar reforms by Government Deputies, the Government rejected the Bill which would have created a mechanism to chase rogue builders.</P>
    <P>My party was briefly in power when the issue of masts arose.  Planning procedures for masts were suspended when Eircell and Telecom Éireann developed our first major microwave mast system.  There are genuine fears about microwave radiation.  For example, in what is perhaps an extreme case, a constituent has papered the interior of his house with aluminium foil because he is so fearful of its effects.  I understand the concerns expressed today.  The Government should address them and should leave matters to the planning system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's efforts to ease the enormous workload which An Bord Pleanála now faces.  I represent two local authorities in this House &mdash; Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council.  Both have received a huge number of applications, including applications for major industrial developments, shopping centres, etc.  In addition, there is growing civil awareness and greater interest in how local areas will be shaped.  The net result is that significant backlogs are developing although An Bord Pleanála continues to process applications in a relatively fast and efficient way.  The requirement of extra staffing and resources has never been more necessary.  I am, therefore, happy to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view of my colleague and spokesperson on the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that it is time we looked at regional plans and considered the possibility of a national plan.  The regional authority system has been established. However, the regional authority for the four Dublin counties is basically an interesting talking shop but with very few powers to do anything about developments.  Effectively, the Dublin City Manager and his staff lead the four Dublin counties and try to promote development of major planning projects such as waste management, new road structures, etc.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the surrounding counties, of Meath, Wicklow and Kildare, which with Dublin constitutes an area with a population of approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million, need a major plan.  In Dublin Corporation and in Fingal County Council we are engaged in reviewing our development plans.  Despite this, there has been almost no direct consultation between the two local authorities regarding what may be described as the boundary areas.  I represent such an area in Dublin North-East.  Some of the area is partly in Dublin City Council, and some is covered by Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council. <Col N="656" /> Recently, colleagues in Fingal County Council have been preparing to make major decisions about industrial and other developments in Clonshaugh over which Dublin City Council has virtually no power.  A stronger regional approach is required and I urge the Minister to seriously consider convening a conference on planning and perhaps producing a report on planning in the Dublin region and surrounding counties.  It requires a concerted and cohesive approach which has not been taken in the past.</P>
    <P>Although a planning system in Dublin did not exist prior to 1963, developments then delivered more satisfying results.  Some of the major problems in the Dublin area are the result of appalling planning decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, especially in the area of public sector housing.  It was not simply the lack of open spaces or recreational facilities, the street and house designs on the northside and westside estates were a recipe for disaster.  The architects and planners who designed them took a condescending approach to the people who were to live in them. For example, the design of space was often indefensible and there were often many end houses, especially on the westside and parts of the northside. The solutions of earlier decades in areas such as Coolock and Ballyfermot, which allowed for normal streets and normal space around houses, was the best approach.  I hope the £200 million reconstruction of Ballymun will revert to the adoption of a basic middle 20th-century villa approach because it delivered better local environments than those produced in the 1970s and 1980s, the results of which were appalling and which have required the expenditure of millions of pounds in attempted reconstruction.</P>
    <P>In recent years our planners have become obsessed with linear streetscapes and the use of pastiche buildings and facades in an effort to give a long linear look to Dublin.  By contrast, in the twin city of Dublin City Council in America, San Jose, a new city centre has been constructed over the past ten to 15 years led by an Irish-American mayor.  A different approach has been adopted involving the construction of free standing and elegant buildings designed in the past couple of decades and which inform the city centre.</P>
    <P>We should take a more mature approach to this issue.  Recently, some architects have become almost fearful of commentators in the heritage and conservation areas.  For example, they have been fearful of designing buildings relatively higher than three stories and of not adopting a Georgian pastiche mode.  They should be encouraged to be more adventurous in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, indeed perhaps since the celebrations of the Dublin millennium in 1988, there have been major improvements in the development of the area.  Will the Minister consider a conference on the Dublin region?  It could lay down a basic framework for planning in the capital in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The problems regarding various development plans and rezoning which have haunted the Dublin <Col N="657" /> region and which will now be aired in an open forum in the Flood tribunal have been referred to.  I hope a number of disquieting issues will be addressed at the tribunal.  It is astonishing that local councillors, although they are not the planning authority and do not have the final say on approving planning matters, have the final say in respect of variations.  Attention should be given to this matter in the event of a review of the planning process.</P>

      <P>I express my sympathy for the McColgan family on the trauma suffered by the wife and children and express the hope that no child or woman in this country will ever have to endure the suffering they endured.  I am pleased the case they took was settled to the satisfaction of all parties.  It is important to stress that the settlement was without admission of liability on the part of the health board or the medical practitioner involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has asked why I did not issue a direction to the North-Western Health Board. Each health board under the relevant health Acts is the body with statutory responsibilities for child care and protection.  In the discharge of these responsibilities, each board must act in accordance with the relevant legislation and take full account of the legal advice which is given to it.  It must also have regard to its contractual obligations, including those which it has entered into in relation to public liability insurance.  In this regard the North-Western Health Board is bound in accordance with normal practice by a clause <Col N="658" /> which gives the sole control and conduct of all claims to the insurer.  In the discharge of its functions and the conduct of its business generally, each board is also subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Having regard to these considerations and, in particular, the statutory role of the health board, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to issue a direction to the health board in relation to the conduct of a legal case.</P>
    <P>The independent review group, established by the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board to examine all aspects of the board's involvement in the case, will now conclude its work which was suspended pending the court hearing.  I expect the group will be in a position to report within a short period.  It is the board's intention to make the findings of this review group public.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the review group are: to review the board's involvement in the case and to assess its response in the context of both the then current service and the likely level of response today, and to make recommendations to the chief executive officer as the group deems appropriate, to ensure that in any such case the board's response is effective.</P>
    <P>Pending the report of this review group, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter or to pre-empt the outcome of the work of the group.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying when it came to defending the proceedings brought by the McColgan family, the health board had no input into the legal strategy adopted, that it was dictated by the health board's insurers and, if so, what was the name of the relevant insurance company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the name of the relevant insurance company on the file but I will supply it to the Deputy when the hearings are concluded.  The advice available to me from the Department is that, in accordance with normal practice, there is a clause which gives the sole control and conduct of all claims to the insurer.  I understand it was the insurer who dictated the strategy adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, in the context of the family and the four people who suffered such tragedy, it is completely unacceptable that it is an insurance company which dictates the manner in which a State body responds to allegations of gross negligence in its care of children? Will the Minister agree that the strategy deployed in the case could have done nothing except add to the stress, strain and hurt endured by the four individuals who suffered abuse for so many years?  Will the Minister accept that legislation should be introduced to prevent health boards seeking to rely on the Statute of Limitations or other legal technicalities, at the insistence of insurance companies, to prevent the truth being <Col N="659" /> known as to the manner in which the welfare of children was addressed by a health board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general rule the proposal that I should issue a direction to each health board not to invoke such defence in all civil actions in which damages are sought against a health board by a victim would have major implications for the handling of all civil actions against State bodies. That is not something with which I can agree.  As I said the insurers had the responsibility and adopted a legal strategy.  Members will recall that the statute of limitations was invoked in the McCole case.</P>
      <P>Under the Acts, the health boards have statutory responsibility.  The relationship between the Department and the BTSB is different in that under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, that body was established by order of the Minister and can be amended by order of the Minister whereas the health boards were set up under Acts of the Oireachtas so that there is not the flexibility that may have existed beforehand.  The other difference is that the insurers revoked cover in the other case and, therefore, the taxpayer will be the ultimate payer.  To that extent, a different situation existed in terms of the Minister's involvement.</P>
      <P>In the McColgan case the initial letter to the board from the solicitors acting on behalf of the McColgans stating that a claim was being lodged was received on 21 November 1995.  The High Court summons initiating proceedings was received on 13 November 1995.  The statement of claim was dated 25 May 1996 and the health board defence was dated 21 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The independent counsel I employed to look at the use of the statute of limitations as part of the defence in the McCole case stated then that:</P>
      <P>To a lawyer this suggests that the State defendants in the McCole case were not precluding the plaintiff from recovering compensation but putting her advisers on notice that the date of accrual of the plaintiff's cause of action ought to have been included in the statement of claim.</P>
      <P>That is an approach which is strictly legally correct. However, to a lay man it may have suggested that the State defendants were attempting to preclude the plaintiff from recovering compensation. That is a reminder of the independent counsel's view of that claim.</P>
      <P>Under the clause which deals with these matters so far as the North Western Health Board is concerned, the people who had sole control over the case were the insurers.  That was a line of defence that was invoked.  I am not suggesting it was justified or appropriate in this case.  I am simply saying the decision to do that lay with the insurers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious issue and has wide implications.  Will the Minister acknowledge that a health board determining whether children should be taken into care and the action to be taken when there is a suggestion that a child or children are being abused, is exercising its responsibility in this area on behalf of the State, as devolved to it by the Oireachtas?  In those circumstances does the Minister regard it as appropriate that if the health board fails to adequately comply with its obligations and if due to the gross negligence by a health board children continue to be tortured and abused and the health board is subsequently sued, neither it nor the State is accountable for its failure?  Will he agree the responsibility to determine how such allegations should be dealt with in court proceedings should not be abdicated to insurance companies and acknowledge that the strategy deployed in this case by whoever was responsible &mdash; the insurance company or the health board &mdash; was inappropriate, based on the tragedy which befell the family, and that, if successful at an early stage, the truth would never have been discovered that there was adequate information available to the health board as early as 1979 that would have facilitated the bringing of care proceedings under existing law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific issue of the statute of limitations, the defendants in this case claimed that a statement of claim had not been lodged within three years of Miss McColgan reaching the age of majority.  The plaintiffs argued that she had sought an exemption on the basis of incapacity. This issue was not resolved by the court as the defendants decided to settle.  We are all glad about that.</P>
      <P>On the general issue, I agree health boards are responsible under statute for the provision of child care services.  It has been admitted in cross-examination that these services were in their infancy during the period in question.  This in no way mitigates or justifies what happened to the McColgan family who have been rightly compensated. Monetary compensation will not compensate them for the loss of their childhood but it is an acknowledgement that compensation was due in this case.</P>
      <P>It is clear the health board is accountable.  A group has been established to review the matter. It will review the health board's involvement in the case, assess its response in the context of the adequacy of the services then in place and the likely response today to see what lessons have been learned, and make whatever recommendations it deems appropriate.  I expect to receive its report in mid-February or early March.  We can then assess how the gaps should be filled. That is where the matter stands in terms of the response of the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear I will get no satisfaction from the Minister on this issue.  Is he saying the strategy employed in this case was an appropriate <Col N="661" /> one and would be an appropriate one if a further case emerges in which a health board was in gross dereliction of its duties?  In the context of the fallacy or myth to which the Minister is contributing that what occurred to the McColgan family is due to the fact that child care services were in their infancy during the period in question, will he agree it is desirable there should be a wider inquiry ordered by him which would be concerned not alone with the approach taken by and the failures of the health board but the approach taken by and the failures of his Department throughout the 1980s to properly address issues relating to child care and children at risk?</P>
      <P>The difficulties in this area and the inadequacies of child care services were well known in 1981 when three children died at the hands of parents who had come to the notice of health boards which failed to take appropriate action.  Is the Minister aware that in 1982 when his colleague, Deputy Woods, was Minister for Health an entire Question Time was devoted to the adequacy of child care services?  I asked the then Minister if he would agree there was grave disquiet and lack of confidence in the procedures then in place for the protection of children.  He assured the public that everything was in order and made comments similar to the comments made by the Minister that no other family should be so affected.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the strategy deployed in this case was indefensible and should not be deployed again?  Will he agree the wider issue of why the McColgan children suffered so greatly and were treated so negligently by the health board should be dealt with as well as the degree to which the Department has monitored properly the child care duties of health boards during the past 15 years and the correctness of the advices given by it with regard to child care guidelines under a succession of Ministers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the introduction in December 1996 of the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations has been the first measure to regulate child care/pre-school services including certain childminders.  My remit in regulating these services is as defined in the Child Care Act, 1991, which refers to &ldquo;regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of pre-school children attending pre-school services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches and child-minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  Childminders looking after fewer than three children are exempted from the provisions of Part VII of the Act in order to avoid interfering with arrangements made by working parents with a relative or neighbour to look after their children for them.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view of effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently I do not have any proposals to introduce further regulations in this area.  However, the expert group on child care, established under Partnership 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector, is currently examining the possible regulation of the child care and childminding industry in its broadest sense.  The expert group, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is expected to issue its report in <Col N="663" /> December 1998.  The Department of Health and Children is represented on the expert group and on a number of sub-groups of the expert group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very dissatisfied with the Minister of State's answer.  The Department of Health and Children seems to be abdicating its full responsibilities in the area of child care and the child care industry.  I accept what the Minister of State said in relation to the Child Care Act, which deals with some aspects of the child care industry, though not satisfactorily, but that is a matter for another day.  I would not like the Minister of State to be under the impression that everything is all right in relation to child care facilities for more than three children.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will agree that in the majority of cases where children are being cared for by people other than their parents, there are fewer than three children.  The majority of our children, therefore, are being cared for by people in an industry operating by and large in the black economy.  Does the Minister of State believe that is satisfactory given that the senior Minister, Deputy Cowen, has responsibility for health and children?</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which a person spends their childhood dictate the way they will turn out as an adult and as a future parent.  For that reason, will the Minister of State agree it is of the utmost importance that we properly regulate and monitor all child minding arrangements?  It is entirely unsatisfactory that this area of child care, which has not received the political attention it requires because of the buck passing that is taking place among Departments, is not being monitored because it involves the majority of children being cared for by people other than their parents. How can the Minister justify that, particularly in light of the cases recently highlighted and the widespread concern among the public generally about the unsatisfactory nature of current arrangements?</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the Minister addresses this area because the people working in this industry are operating in the black economy.  He must also address the problem of the absence of tax relief for parents to allow them ensure quality of child care and the lack of any supports for people caring for children.  I regret the Minister of State is not giving this issue the political priority it deserves and the fact that he is not providing any reassurance to the many parents concerned about this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that historically the provision of child care/pre-school services has been grossly inadequate but I remind her that the regulations were only introduced in December l996.  Since then a very proactive approach has been taken by my predecessor and myself since I entered the Department, and much work has been done also by the health boards in putting these regulations in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Under the regulations, pre-school providers were obliged to notify their health board of their existence prior to 30 June l997; approximately 1,100 such facilities notified their existence prior to that date.  I am not satisfied with the numbers who have notified as I understand there may be as many as 3,300 such facilities across the country. I have asked the health boards to ensure that all providers notify their existence so that inspections can be carried out.</P>
    <P>I have provided an additional £8 million this year towards the provision of child care services, thanks to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance.  Of this amount, £500,000 additional money has been provided for the continued implementation of the Child Care Act in this specific area.  The health boards are now inspecting facilities throughout the country and it is intended that within a two year period all facilities will be inspected and, thereafter, annual inspections will take place.</P>
    <P>Given that the regulations only came into operation a little more than 12 months ago, a proactive approach is currently being taken by the Department.  We will shortly provide a guide to good practice in pre-school services which is currently in draft form.  We also have a monitoring committee in our Department made up of all the health boards.  That committee is involved in ensuring that a consistent approach is taken to the implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I reject the Deputy's contention that work is not being done.  I agree that the amount of resources being put into this area is inadequate but a significant increase has been provided.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, said he will revisit the issue of tax relief for parents with children in crèches, etc., in the forthcoming budget.  I hope that such tax relief will be introduced which will have a significant impact on the parents and on pre-school industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is missing the point.  I am not talking about facilities covered by the Child Care Act.  That situation is not entirely satisfactory but I will deal with that matter again.  I am talking about the fact that the majority of pre-school children are being cared for in facilities not covered by the Child Care Act. We currently have a large number of children being cared for in facilities where no statutory guidelines apply, and the Minister has not addressed that problem.  I am talking about neighbours caring for children, people who advertise child minding services or who are caring for one or two children in their own homes.  A whole array of private child care arrangements are not covered by any statutory guidelines.  Does the Minister propose to regulate this part of the industry which is the largest part in terms of the number of children involved?  Does he have an estimate of the number of children being cared for under private arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point the Minister has not addressed is the extent to which this part of the market <Col N="665" /> operates in the black economy.  Is the Minister concerned about that?  Garda checks are not carried out on these people.  There are no guidelines in place or supports for parents who do not have any come back in the event of abuse, neglect or harm to their children.  The Minister of State did not mention this part of the sector in his two replies.  Has he any plans to regulate that area and what does he intend to do to address the problem that most of the industry is operating in the black economy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Childminders caring for fewer than three children were exempted from the provisions of section 7 of the Act to avoid interfering with the arrangements made by working parents with a relative or a neighbour to care for their children.  That exemption was introduced by amendment to the Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas. The intention of the Bill was to regulate playgroups and crèches which catered for young children from different families.  If the Deputy examines the Official Report she will see that much concern was expressed in the Oireachtas at that time to the effect that if we were to regulate for every neighbour or relative caring for one or two children, people would be regulated out of the business.  Because of that an amendment was included to provide this regulation would apply in cases where more than three children are being minded, and I agree with that.  Parents who leave their child or children with a neighbour or relative have a responsibility to satisfy themselves that person is responsible and capable of looking after their child or children.  The majority of parents are satisfied with such arrangements.  A recent case highlighted a major problem that arose in such circumstances, but I am satisfied the regulations introduced through the Oireachtas are adequate.  If I were to contemplate making a change to cover every neighbour or relative who minds one child, I would be interfering too much in the parenting business.  However, we will keep this area under review.</P>
      <P>It is not correct for the Deputy to contend that most children are outside the provisions of the Child Care Act, but a number of crèches and pre-schools have not registered to date.  In the coming 12 months I will insist that all the facilities obliged to notify the health boards under the Act do so and, if they do not, action will be taken.  If and when tax relief applies to those facilities, it will apply only to those crèches which have notified the health boards and are operating in the legitimate economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the regulations will be implemented I am satisfied the people engaged in this area of the black economy will be rooted out and a level playing pitch will be created for all those engaged in pre-school child care.  The majority of people involved in this industry do a great job under difficult circumstances.  There are a range of issues from planning permission and regulations which will impose additional costs <Col N="666" /> on those engaged in the industry to a variety of other issues which the nurseries association brought to my attention and on which I am engaged in discussions with it.  I have had a number of discussions with the nurseries association.  I intend to regulate this area.  We will implement sensible regulations to ensure that as far as possible the provisions of good pre-school facilities throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely that approach that has led to so many serious problems arising in the child care area.  Does the Minister of State consider he has any responsibility in regulating the child care area?  Most pre-school children are cared for in conditions not covered under the Child Care Act.  Has the Minister of State considered drawing up a register of child care workers?  That would be one way of establishing how many people are working in this area and introducing some regulation into the industry. The Minister of State said the Child Care Act will gradually regulate all these situations, but that is not the case.  The Child Care Act does not apply to many people, many of whom are in the black economy, working in the child care industry.  The Minister of State's approach of depending on the Child Care Act to cover this area is misguided because the problems coming to light indicate a great section of the industry is unregulated.  Has the Minister of State any proposals to regulate that section, to &ldquo;interfere&rdquo; in that area because that is what is required?  We should have learned from past mistakes that the State must be involved in the area of child care.  It must find out what is happening and regulate to ensure there are proper standards in all matters concerning the care of children.  I am worried by the Minister of State's approach of avoiding interference in an area of child care.  That is what has brought us into such disrepute in regard to many different aspects of child care services.  Has the Minister of State any proposals or does he intend devoting any attention to regulating the entire child care industry in the near future, in particular those circumstances where fewer than three children are being cared for by one individual?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  The Oireachtas agreed an amendment whereby a cut off point of three children would apply in this area.  We can introduce regulations to apply to all families, but that would not represent common sense.  Parents have a responsibility in this area.  Those who leave their child or children with an adult who is looking after fewer than three children have a responsibility to ensure that they trust that person and are satisfied that their child or children are in good care.  If they are not satisfied, they have an alternative option.  They can put their child or children into a crèche which is regulated under the Child Care Act.  A number of crèches have not notified the relevant health board to date, but I intend to ensure that they will notify it and that they will be inspected and regulated.  I cannot wave a magic wand to ensure that will be done. The regulations have been in place for only 12 months.  I provided additional resources and we are moving as quickly as possible to regulate those in this sector who should be subject to regulation. We should not introduce regulations to apply to the woman who minds her neighbour's child.  If we did that we would be attempting to introduce regulations which, in the majority of cases, are not needed.  Child care is the responsibility of parents in the first instance and, in most cases, these arrangements work well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a social services inspectorate is a priority for the Government.  It has been decided to proceed with the inspectorate on an administrative basis initially and it will be located in the Department of Health and Children. Advertisements for positions in the inspectorate will be placed as soon as the detailed arrangements for its establishment have been approved.</P>
      <P>The development of foster care services will be discussed with the health boards with a view to ensuring that foster care can be made available in all appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>As I indicated yesterday, the appointment of an ombudsman for children has implications for a number of Departments dealing with issues relating to children and it will be necessary to clarify the departmental roles and responsibilities in this regard.  In terms of the resources available to me in 1998, I have identified the establishment of a social services inspectorate as a top priority and, accordingly, I propose the establishment of the inspectorate immediately.  However, I am committed to the introduction of an ombudsman for children in due course.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of an association for children in care, the health boards have been asked for their views on this matter and, while a formal response is awaited, it is understood there is no objection in principle.  It is envisaged that it should be possible to have this association established during 1998.  As I explained to the House last year, I am adopting a broad approach to the issue of improving the reporting of child abuse.  The mandatory reporting of child abuse is a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium and it will be introduced in the lifetime of the Government.  I regard it as essential that this is done in a way which will have wide support from the professions which will have to comply with the requirement and produce a reporting scheme which is efficient, effective and sensitive to the needs of children.  I also consider that considerable additional investment in our childcare services will be required in advance of the introduction of mandatory reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced my intention of continuing the progress of initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting of child abuse as outlined in the document, Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children. I am in the process of establishing a working group to review the 1987 and 1995 child abuse guidelines.  I consider this a crucial first step in <Col N="671" /> creating an environment which will help to facilitate the reporting of child abuse.  We have seen enormous changes in regard to the level of awareness of child abuse in the last ten years and a considerable expansion of services to protect vulnerable children.  Our knowledge of this complex area has increased and the time is opportune to review these guidelines.</P>
    <P>The working group will have an independent chairperson and will include representatives of the following agencies: the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science, health boards, the Garda Síochána, the children's rights alliances and the voluntary sector, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Association of Social Workers, the Resident Managers Association, IMPACT and the INTO.  I will announce the membership of the group and its terms of reference next week.</P>
    <P>Regarding a possible constitutional amendment to underpin the rights of the child, this matter has been referred to the all-party committee on the Constitution for its views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State.  In relation to the social services inspectorate, when does the Minister of State intend placing it on a statutory basis?  The provision of foster care services for all children who require them will entail the allocation of huge resources.  Has the Minister of State quantified the level of resources needed? When will he be in a position to state that sufficient foster care places are available for all children who need them?</P>
      <P>Regarding the undertakings given to establish an ombudsman for children, the Minister of State said there is a need to clarify the roles of various organisations and individuals.  As one of the outstanding needs in the child care area, what type of timescale does the Minister of State have in mind for this matter?  How long will it take to clarify those roles and when does the Minister of State think the office will be established?</P>
      <P>I broadly agree with the Minster of State's approach to mandatory reporting.  A considerable lead in time will be required and there is undoubtedly a need for substantial additional resources to be provided for the child care area before mandatory reporting can be introduced. Has the Minister of State quantified the resources required?  What timescale does he have in mind for the introduction of mandatory reporting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will monitor its performance.  I have no problem putting it on a statutory basis. However, it must be established and start doing the important work that urgently needs to be done.  I will report back to the Deputy about the issue of placing it on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I place this matter ahead of the ombudsman for children because I do not have the staffing or financial resources to proceed immediately with the appointment of such an ombudsman.  I accept the point made in Geneva that it is important to make such an appointment.  I am in discussion with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to try to secure a cross-departmental role for the ombudsman and in terms of the strategy regarding children which everybody agrees is required.  We are examining that issue and intend to bring proposals to the House.  I accept that a long lead-in time is needed for mandatory reporting, which has caused much unnecessary division.  We all want to provide the most effective system of reporting so that no case is unreported.  We are not providing the most effective response, as Deputy Shortall will be aware of from the Eastern Health Board region.  I compliment her on her leadership in this respect. However, we are unable to respond to the number of reports received due to a lack of resources. All parties must accept that there is a need for a massive increase in the resources being provided for children.  My objective is to point the way for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard foster care as the most important single issue in the child care area.  It is a wonderful resource that is very cost effective.  Foster parents <Col N="673" /> take care of the most vulnerable and neglected children.  My greatest priority is to expand this service to the point where every child who needs it can avail of foster care.  Parents who foster children, giving them the love and attention they require badly, are the best people we have.  I meet people who have fostered from 40 to 60 children with very little support from the State.  Those children would be very neglected if it were not for that care.  I intend to expand this facility, though it costs a great deal of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State clarify the situation regarding mandatory reporting?  His party's programme for Government stated clearly that it would be introduced.  Before Christmas a broad approach to mandatory reporting was mentioned by the Minister, and that has been repeated today.  That is a conversion to the position of the previous Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  I have no problem with that, but there is much confusion because of the statement of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, in Geneva to the effect that mandatory reporting would be introduced. The Minister of State spoke about a broad approach to mandatory reporting.  Does he accept that there is confusion in the child care service about what is going to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion is being caused by people like Deputy Neville who seem to harp on about mandatory reporting without defining it or, as I have found, without knowing what it is.  I have been very specific on each occasion I have dealt with this issue, and I have been specific today.  Mandatory reporting is in the programme for Government, and it is intended to implement it during the lifetime of the Government.  There are two critical agreements that must first be put in place.  First, protocols and procedures must be agreed with the professionals involved.  Second, there must be a significant increase in the amount of resources made available to deal with the increased number of reports.</P>
      <P>I must be cognisant of the real fears of many professionals in this field.  Consequently, I am proceeding with this working group to strengthen the guidelines and to set up binding protocols and procedures.  It will then be a matter of putting these on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is genuine in his commitment to his brief.  Does he accept that because of this Government's downgrading of the importance of children he is in an impossible position?  He does not have the co-ordinating authority to bring in the necessary reforms.  He should answer the grave concerns raised by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child due to the lack of co-ordination.  There is no focus because of the fragmentation.  In view of this, how does the Minister of State feel he can deliver on an ombudsman?  The Government was shamed at the UN Committee on the Rights of <Col N="674" /> the Child into making commitments.  I presume there are no resources for an ombudsman in 1998. The Minister should clarify this.  It is one thing to go abroad and put one's best foot forward to impress people far away but it is another matter to stand over those commitments at home.  We need to be told what the precise position is, not the Minister of State's aspirational position.</P>
      <P>I did not believe in the introduction of mandatory reporting, but neither do I believe in a Government which says one thing this minute and another the next.  Does the Minister of State agree with a clear statement made to the UN committee by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell?  She said that in 1997 there were non-binding guidelines which governed such matters in the health boards.  These were found to be ineffective in the view of Deputy O'Donnell, who did not believe that the reporting of the crime of child abuse should be left to the discretion of professionals.</P>
      <P>If that is the view of a Government Minister while speaking to such an important committee, how can the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, maintain that he can continue consultation on the basis of reporting by professionals?  Are these not two totally contradictory views on mandatory reporting?  I have asked three separate questions, and I deserve three separate answers.</P>

      <P>While I hold this office I do not intend to state aspirations about children.  That is why I have been very frank.  I cannot introduce the provisions for an ombudsman this year.  Contrast that with the Opposition's period in Government, when glossy reports were produced.  My predecessor produced a memorandum for Government looking for significantly increased resources which was dumped.  Let us treat this issue with the importance it requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of an adequate service for our children is the most important task we have.  I will not be all things to all men on the problems we face.  I picked my priorities and intend to <Col N="675" /> implement them.  I got £13 million extra this year, but it is not nearly enough.  I have laid out my priorities.  Deputies should not try to confuse them, and I will not to try to mislead Deputies.  I will not promise anything I cannot deliver.  I have ten brilliant staff members in the childcare section of the Department of Health and Children but they cannot do the vast amount of work I want them to do, and I cannot get agreement for additional staff.  That matter notwithstanding, we are making significant progress.</P>

      <P>I must take a number of important steps before we reach that point.  By taking those steps I am satisfied we will improve the mechanisms for reporting and, more importantly, we will improve the response of the health boards and the various agencies to those reports when they are received so that victims may report in the knowledge that there will be a satisfactory support for them and they will be given the counselling and support needed to cope with this terrible crime of child abuse.  This is wider than child sexual abuse.  It involves physical and mental abuse and abject neglect which, unfortunately, thousands of children suffer in this community.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy for the Minister of State.  He has explained the central nature of the problem.  I asked him to elucidate the question of co-ordinating responsibility between Departments because this is an issue to which we keep coming back.

      <P>Since I came to this Department I have had regular meetings with those in the Department of Education and Science and the Department Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We operated under the strategic management initiative and the support and involvement of the other two Departments with my Department has been significant.  As a result of the legitimate criticisms of our policies in Geneva, the Taoiseach decided to officially appoint me to the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science.  There is and has been great co-ordination since I was appointed to this job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first appointed to this job I found we had 63 children before the High Court where <Col N="676" /> the State was trying to defend the indefensible. We were paying legal fees of £13,000 per case per day.  We did not have any place to put them.  A site was not even available due to the work of the last Government.  I have involved all three Departments and we have got planning permission and are proceeding to build a facility for those children.  The chairperson of the Eastern Health Board will be aware that we spent £1.5 million in recent years on legal fees in the High Court.  There are problems and I do not have a magic wand but I assure the Deputy that I am working hard to tackle them.</P>

The Minister of State identified a fundamental problem that there are ten staff only in the Department.  What is the Minister doing about that?  Why are there ten staff only and why is the budget insufficient?  Solemn commitments were given to the UN committee on these priority areas and I intend to track those commitments over the lifetime of this Government.  It is vital that we move beyond being aspirational about them.</P>

All parties in the House must acknowledge that if we want to look after the most neglected and abused children and those at risk, irrespective of ombudsmen or committees, we will need to spend an additional £100 million in the next three years. The Deputy, as chairman of the Eastern Health Board, will be aware that the C case highlighted the most appalling situation one could imagine.  It is hardly credible that a family could live like that in this day and age.  I have a price tag and a time-scale. In my efforts with the Government and those of others in the House, we must realise that we must spend money on the have nots &mdash; those at the lowest level.  I have a timescale and I hope this Government will provide the money.  I am <Col N="677" /> satisfied the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are committed to making this a top priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 17 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The product Amerscan Pulmonate II is administered to persons undergoing lung scans by x-ray. It is an imaging agent, administered by injection, and finds its way to the lungs, where it enables doctors to produce an image of the lung structure <Col N="678" /> so they can detect lung disorders.  It is often used in the late stage of lung disease and disorder and assists both the investigating and treating physicians in arriving at the relevant diagnosis and in prescribing the appropriate treatment regime.</P>
    <P>Following contact with the hospitals in which the product, which was the subject of recent publicity, was administered, the Department has established that a total of 460 persons received the product. The Department asked each of the nine hospitals involved to identify all persons to whom the product was administered, to make arrangements to inform each person and to provide appropriate counselling.  A clinical information pack was sent to each hospital, and this consisted of scientific data in relation to the composition and operation of Amerscan Pulmonate II, on the clinical issues in relation to nvCJD and the possibility of its transmission through the product.</P>
    <P>The Department asked each hospital to ensure that the physicians who treated the persons concerned would meet each person individually and brief him or her fully on the particular circumstances, using the background information in the clinical information pack.  In addition the Department asked each hospital to arrange counselling appropriate to the needs and wishes of each of the persons who received the product and that the treating physician should liaise with the person's general practitioner, to facilitate any follow-up that might be required.</P>
    <P>Blood, blood products and pharmaceutical products which contain blood derivatives are essential parts of health care.  In the case of Amerscan Pulmonate II, the use of this product, which is not a blood product, but which contains a very small amount of a protein albumin isolated from blood plasma, is an essential prerequisite for determining the relevant treatment regime in individual patients suffering from lung disease and disorder.</P>
    <P>The provision of information about a diagnostic test using Amerscan Pulmonate II would be part of the confidential doctor-patient relationship, under which a person undergoing any test or treatment, would be informed by the doctor of the benefits that would accrue to the patient, as well as any known risk arising from the intervention or treatment, the nature and magnitude of any risk and, in the doctor's view, the degree to which the benefit outweighs any risk.</P>
    <P>I consider that currently there is adequate provision in the Medical Council's &ldquo;Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour and to Fitness to Practice&rdquo; to ensure that patients are informed about medical interventions and I do not consider it necessary to propose to Government that further legislation is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the majority of people to whom Amerscan Pulmonate II was administered were blissfully unaware that this product contained any blood derivative of any nature?  Does he agree it is important that <Col N="679" /> in the future if any product is found to contain such derivatives, the patient is informed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Patients' Charter provides that people should be informed.  The product in question contains one twenty-thousandth of a drop of blood.  One has to take cognisance of that. I am not aware of any complaint having been made by anybody about the fact that they were not informed of the exact nature of the product. There is a doctor-client relationship, and I would not be aware of a complaint unless it was made to a third party at the Irish Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the context of this and any other product that might be administered in the future, it is desirable that medical practitioners inform patients of the nature of the product in so far as it does contain a blood derivative, no matter how small the blood derivative might be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for emergency procedures that might preclude that, it would be advisable that medical practitioners recognise this is an issue that members of the community would like to be advised about prior to ingesting any such product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 137 together</P>
      <P>The public hospital system currently employs 3,852 doctors and 27,265 nurses.  The number of doctors in the system has been increased by 17 per cent since 1990 and the number of nurses has increased by 10 per cent in the same period.  This increase in staffing has been accompanied by an increase in the quality of service provided as well as an increase in the range of services available to patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of staffing to be provided in any hospital is a matter, in the first instance, for the health board or hospital concerned.  Staffing levels are assessed in the light of local needs and <Col N="680" /> having regard to the nature of the service provided.</P>
    <P>My Department constantly receives requests from health boards and hospitals to enhance and expand the range of hospital services.  These requests are considered in the light of available resources and in the context of their own priorities.</P>
    <P>Letters of determination setting out funding levels for 1998 were issued to health agencies in December of last year.  My Department is now examining the service plans submitted by the agencies, as required by the letters of determination. The service plans will be the subject of intensive discussions between officers of my Department and the health agencies.  Overall numbers employed, including medical and nursing staffing levels, will be discussed with the agencies in this context.</P>
    <P>Future medical and nursing staffing requirements will be the subject of study as part of a general review of medical staffing structures and as part of the work of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there are major problems in relation to staffing and that anomalies have been highlighted in the Tierney report and, more recently, when Professor Muiris Fitzgerald sounded a note of alarm in relation to the imbalance in the ratio of junior hospital doctors to consultants and the introduction by the Irish Medical Council of a language and competency examination for non nationals? Is the Minister not aware that this has become a major issue in the medical profession and internally in the Department which produced the Tierney report?  Does he not accept that there are major problems regarding staffing of our hospitals, particularly our public hospitals, where we have major waiting lists and where we have junior doctors with inadequate training working in accident and emergency units in a way that is unacceptable and which has been seriously criticised by Professor Fitzgerald and in the Tierney report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that changes in that respect will require changes in medical manpower policy.  The need to improve training for junior hospital doctors has been a hoary chestnut for some time.  The need for consultants to make time available for proper training is another issue. I commend Professor Muiris Fitzgerald's lecture in this regard.  It was highly enlightening in terms of its scope and the implications of what he had to say.  Certainly there is food for thought in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be a case for more staff in our hospitals and health services generally.  The problem for successive Ministers is that the Department of Health and Children is a Department which seeks to accommodate infinite expectations with finite budgets.  Unfortunately I am subject to budgetary constraints, although this Government has increased this year's allocation <Col N="681" /> by 12 per cent against a background of an economic policy that sees public spending increase in Government terms of 4 per cent.  Clearly, within Government policy implementation the Department of Health and Children is obtaining the sort of priority one would expect from a Government like ours which is trying to implement some of the policies that I and my junior Ministers are enlightening the House on today.  There are costs involved, but there is always an argument for spending more.</P>
    <P>I take the point that there are medical manpower issues.  We are aware of them in the Department.  I have had discussions with top management about it.  We are devising strategies for counteracting those changes.  The role of non EU doctors in our hospital system has been much underrated.  Without them it would be difficult to manage our hospitals.  Unfortunately many of our medical graduates have seen it as a necessary step in their career path to emigrate as senior registrars and get experience elsewhere.  It was the only way they felt they could get consultant positions in this country.  We need to change that so that we do not have a situation where half of our medical graduates are emigrating.  We need them in our hospital system.  That, it is hoped, will be reflected in an increased level of quality care.  We need to ensure that the consultant-led hospital service we have does not preclude the type of training that is necessary if we are to maintain quality.</P>
    <P>In relation to nurses and other paramedics, for example, physiotherapists, there are many instances where one would like to see a greater complement of people.  Here again, finite budgets and financial constraints delimit what one can do year on year.  However, in the service plans which have come back from the health agencies as a result of the allocations in December 1997, we have seen prospects for improved staffing arrangements in some of our hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, particularly as a general rule, in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive office of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above, the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department has made the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is considering extending medical card eligibility to elderly people because they tend to use general practitioner services more frequently and a trip to a doctor and a prescription can cost between £30 and £40, an expense which would not have been anticipated by people when making plans for their retirement.  It is something I would like to see.  We have free travel for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These expenses arise frequently and I would like to see the scheme extended.  Many people <Col N="683" /> over 65 years can afford travel expenses but there is a principle involved.  What would be the cost to the Department of extending the scheme to all persons over 75 years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Midland Health Board, the board with which I am most <i>au fait</i>, it is the practice whenever possible &mdash; I am sure the same procedure is followed by the directors of community care in other health boards &mdash; to give a medical card to elderly people who need medication and who may be just outside the income guidelines. This is done at the discretion of the chief executive officer.  The scheme is means tested and if people are well outside the guidelines then obviously there is a problem.  Bearing in mind the commitment in the programme, I have asked chief executive officers to look at the implications of this proposal and how the scheme can be improved.</P>
      <P>I would be very slow to move away from the principle of a means test as the inclusion of people who can well afford to pay their medical expenses &mdash; these are a minority of the elderly population &mdash; would deprive others from receiving a medical card.  However, we must address the issue from the point of view of the elderly and larger families for whom the loss of a medical card is a disincentive to re-entering the workforce. Obviously this impacts on tax policy as well as health policy.  I have asked chief executive officers to look at the financial implications of this proposal and to ascertain how much can be done during the lifetime of this administration.</P>

      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Clune.  On free schemes and medical cards for the elderly, is the Minister aware that more money is spent in assessing and processing applications than is paid to recipients?  The net cost of widening the definition of the &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; would be significantly different from the gross cost and I ask the Minister to give favourable and sympathetic consideration to giving all elderly people a medical card.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Belton, I am referring to people who are 66 years and over.  As this area is governed by guidelines only and chief executive officers are given some discretion, some chief executive officers may be more appreciative of the need for a medical card in certain circumstances. This discretion should be left with chief executive officers.  The chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board is well aware of the strong representations made by representatives of the Longford area on behalf of the elderly. Deputy Belton can be assured that he receives the best possible hearing.</P>

      <P>I extend the Minister's and my deepest sympathy to the family of Mrs. Catherine Gaffney from County Meath who was killed yesterday in the incident to which the Deputy referred.  I know I speak for all Members when I say that what happened on the road between Rochfortbridge and Milltownpass yesterday was a tragedy for all concerned.

        <i>(Mayo):</i> The Minister of State's performance can only be surpassed by that of the senior Minister when he was questioned in the House about the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill.  That was the most appalling performance by a Minister in recent years.  It was a fillibuster and a refusal to impart information legitimately sought by Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  Yesterday an individual came before the court in Galway.  The charges were not even read to the court.  The individual was charged with being a passenger in a stolen car in Galway on 30 November, 1996.  He was also charged with being a passenger in a stolen car at Ryan's Hotel in Galway at a later date and with <Col N="686" /> breaking and entering into that hotel and stealing goods to the value of £315.  These charges were not read to the court.  Furthermore, the man's track record was not read to the court, nor was evidence adduced to sustain the case that the man had AIDS.  There was no doctor in court.  The case took a total of 45 seconds.  An innocent woman is dead because bail was extended when the man concerned should have been in jail.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> The manner in which the case was prosecuted yesterday is a matter for the State.  The Minister of State's legal representatives were in court yesterday.  They had a charge sheet which contained three charges.  The charges were not read to the court and the hearing took 45 seconds.</P>
      <P>The man had a long track record.  He was a well known drug addict who used to throw himself on the road in Summerhill in Dublin.  He had previously attacked people.  A man with numerous convictions was allowed to go free and his criminal and medical records were not read to the court.  It was the State's responsibility to prosecute this case and it is the Minister's responsibility, as the agent responsible for the instruments of criminal justice, to answer to the House and to vindicate, validate, defend or acknowledge the circumstances in this case.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has come to the House with one hand as long as the other and refuses to impart any information.  I am not asking her to prejudice the cases that are due to come before the courts in Mullingar or Galway.  Those cases have yet to be determined.  I am asking the Minister of State to outline this man's previous criminal record.  How many offences were involved, when were they prosecuted, how and when were the convictions obtained and what sentences were imposed?  Is it true that a five year prison sentence was imposed on this individual in the recent past?</P>

The State is prosecuting that case and the defendant was given bail but the case must still be brought to a conclusion.  Observers of this matter must appreciate that I cannot say anything that would prejudice the case, particularly <Col N="687" /> in view of the current serious circumstances.

      <P>This person is well known to the Garda Síochána and has a long criminal record.  I commend the gardaí on the manner in which they performed their duties yesterday and I commend the former Minister, Deputy Owen, for providing the gardaí with the air support unit which was crucial in ensuring that the person was arrested even though he had taken a taxi.  With regard to previous convictions, on what date was this individual first brought before the courts?  How many times was he before the courts and with what offences was he charged?  What convictions were imposed?  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the courts and holds court records.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  Most individuals involved in local government &mdash; many Members of the Oireachtas are members of local authorities &mdash; find the planning procedure has changed dramatically in recent years, probably mostly for the good, but much bureaucracy and regulation has been introduced which leaves people who apply for planning permission extremely frustrated.  Those people approach their local public representative who makes representation to the planning authority involved, <Col N="690" /> but the information given is sometimes sparse.  As a public representative, I find the issue of planning one of the most difficult to deal with and on which to get information.  The relationship between those applying for planning permission and the planning authority is sometimes fraught. That does not provide for positive regulation of the planning laws.</P>
      <P>Some years ago when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was Minister for the Environment he introduced a number of EU regulations pertaining to planning, which resulted in vast changes for planning authorities.  Many planning authorities said they did not have the staff or the capabilities to implement those far-reaching regulations, and that has caused much difficulty and frustration. Many of the regulations introduced were of benefit, but Governments should have the potential to change the regulations that cause difficulties.  Just because regulations are inherited from the EU does not mean they operate efficiently.  To make the planning system more consumer friendly, rather than increasing the number of people in certain cases, An Bord Pleanála should deal with the difficulties experienced by planning authorities.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where a person who applied for planning permission had to wait eight weeks for the planning authority to reply.  On the day before the eight weeks were up the planning authority wrote to the applicant to say the townland was misspelt and that the person should readvertise and reapply for planning permission. That is ludicrous and is not what was intended by the regulations.  I cannot understand why the planning authority could not make a phone call or write a letter two days after receiving the application to say that the townland was wrongly spelt.  I am not saying that happens on a regular basis, but small problems such as those cause frustration to applicants.  When a public representative is asked to mediate on such issues it is difficult to explain to a constituent why it takes so long for a planning authority to deal with such a minor issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to planning permission for afforestation. I come from a part of the country where major incentives are given to the agricultural community and financial investors to plant vast areas of land with coniferous trees.  Vast areas of Leitrim and Sligo have been taken over by afforestation. I am not against afforestation, but I am against the unplanned abuse of forestry, particularly in the west.  The Minister, Deputy Molloy, will be aware that this is happening not only in the two counties I represent but throughout the west.  This is an issue that has been neglected by all Governments.  Previously planning permission was needed for afforestation of 200 hectares of land but that figure has been reduced to 70 hectares, which is a move in the right direction.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Yates, on taking that initiative and the Department of the <Col N="691" /> Environment and Local Government for introducing it.</P>
    <P>However, 70 hectares is still a vast quantity of land in rural Ireland and especially in the west where the size of holdings is very small, usually 30 to 40 acres.  We have all seen people move from their rural environment because they are surrounded by forestry.  Those people had no right and could not object to unplanned afforestation. I firmly believe it is a mistake to allow this to happen.  If we do not try to solve the problem and regulate the matter, there will be a vast movement of people from rural to urban areas.  I know the EU is giving vast financial assistance to leave land fallow.  A more planned approach to afforestation should be examined.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise An Bord Pleanála on any decisions it has made.  However, as regards representations made to the board, it is very difficult to get information.  I do not believe public representatives are entitled to sensitive information, but we should be entitled to information which we could give to our constituents to show them progress is being made on their applications. The manner in which An Bord Pleanála deals with requests is secretive.  This Bill should go some way toward countering that rather than appointing an additional two people to the board which will not solve the problem.  Perhaps there is a difficulty with the number of staff or inspectors provided to the board.  It should be more consumer friendly.  If that were the case, there would not be as much difficulty or frustration with planning applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill because it deals with an issue which impacts on the lives of most of us.  As regards the planning function, my colleague, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, said it all when he spoke of it being consumer friendly.  Has the raft of planning regulations and the various Acts of the Oireachtas over the years in the planning area been more to the benefit of lawyers than ordinary people?  How many people understand the planning laws?  Are they phrased in layman's language?  I ask any of my colleagues in the Oireachtas to frame an understanding of what is meant by planning laws.  There is an extract from the commencement order of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, which says it all.  It reads:</P>
      <P>On the 19th day of October, 1992, the remaining provisions of the Act of 1992, except paragraph (g) of section 19(4) as respects paragraph (b) of subsection (6) of the section inserted in the Act of 1976 by the said paragraph (g), shall come into operation.</P>
      <P>How many of us would understand that?  How many ordinary people, if they were to interpret planning law, would understand it?  When we frame legislation in the House, do we understand it or do we frame it with regard to the legal dimension afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Let us consider how planning has evolved over the years.  We try to encourage small industry and business.  In many cases a person wants to set up a business in their garage or in a shed at the back of the house.  It is immediately regarded as a commercial venture so they are pressurised into taking an advance factory or small unit.  Suddenly they find their business is uneconomic and they find it difficult to earn a living, whereas they would probably have eked one out in the small garage or shed.  Neighbours often resist such a small commercial venture taking place next door to them, although it does not impact on them at all.  Many people build a nice bungalow out in the country and they object when someone wants to build alongside them.  They become one of the objectors and join An Taisce with their independent views.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with planning in the industrial sector.  I remember there was only one objection to planning permission for the Tarbert oil refinery in 1983, which never materialised.  Only one person objected to the Raybestos asbestos factory in Cork.  Such a venture would not get out of the traps today.  The Sandoz plant in Cork had to go through a plethora of legal trials.  It went through every legal aspect and the company eventually became frustrated.  Have we gone overboard and lost a sense of balance with regard to the environment so that our concern acts in many cases as a deterrent to potential industry which may set up here?  Deputy Gormley of the Green Party will speak after me and will probably say differently from me.  However, I wonder if the planning area has become a monster in the sense that we have gone overboard, even in this House. There is now a raft of Oireachtas Acts and regulations dealing with the planning area.</P>
    <P>What degree of planning takes place between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Coillte and various bodies, such as the local authorities, when future forestry policy is being decided?  When it is said that up to 18 per cent of the country should be planted with trees, is it realised that the decision will impact on many county councils and local communities?  Are people to be driven out of the places in which they live?  In many cases in my county, rural villages and areas are being depleted because they are surrounded by forestry, yet there is not much planning in that sector.  There are certain restrictions, but it is still possible to proceed with a forest plantation of a considerable size thus probably driving people out of the area.  Perhaps we have gone overboard in providing protection for some areas and neglected others.</P>
    <P>I have often had people come to me having made a planning application only to receive a letter from the local authority within eight weeks requiring further information on the development. It can also be seen from such letters that the period of eight weeks dates from then.  Suddenly people are terrified and frightened and wonder why it was never pointed out to them before that a difficulty existed or additional information <Col N="693" /> was required.  How many people go through the planning process and spend much money framing an application for a house, for example, only to be rejected afterwards because of septic tank considerations, although local authority officials knew that certain areas were very suspect with regard to septic tanks?  Would it not be wiser to forewarn people that planning applications for that kind of development in such areas might run into problems because of previous experience?  People are often put to considerable expense when they might have been better off not putting in a planning application in the first place. The system is not perfect nor is it customer friendly.  There is scope for looking at all of this.</P>
    <P>Appointing extra people to An Bord Pleanála may be a cosmetic exercise and may not set the world on fire.  However, the entire planning issue can be examined.  We have gone overboard in many instances.</P>
    <P>In my county we rarely have section 4s.  They normally abound in those counties with the best tourism products.  Why is this?  My councillor colleagues may not appreciate my saying so but it is because three quarters of the council will decide on a section 4.  There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> involved in councils.  We took a decision that there would be no section 4s.  In other counties it is the case that if a Fianna Fáil person applies they get a Fine Gael person to back them and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is wrong.  We were not going in the right direction in stipulating that three quarters of council members must be in favour of a section 4.  The Minister knows what I am referring to.  Unfortunately, our tourism product is being blighted by section 4s which involve improper planning decisions.  I am not sure that we have addressed this problem.  I have concluded that we have not.</P>

      <P>I understand a review of the planning process is under way.  This is welcome as there is deep frustration and anger among people I represent about the process.  It is seen as inadequate. In some cases enforcement is non-existent and there are many problems.  I will cite some of the problems I have come across in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major applications for planning in Dublin South East &mdash; one is in St. Anne's in Milltown involving 18.6 acres and 476 residential units.  This is a lovely green space which is the lungs of the city.  We have already vigorously fought this development with An Bord Pleanála. It was interesting that one of the arguments used by the planners was that this was a sustainable development.  This argument is being used consistently &mdash; if a development is on the DART people can be transported into the city and so it is sustainable.  I do not believe the argument itself <Col N="694" /> is sustainable.  We are talking about people's quality of life.  These developments diminish that quality of life and sustainability must be about quality of life.  Unfortunately, these arguments are not taken on board by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>A similar development is proposed for Ringsend in which the same argument is being used. This is one of the biggest developments in the city which I will vigorously oppose.  It is proposed by the famous Zoe Developments to which Deputy Higgins has often referred.  This is a huge development comprising 655 residential units. The area is already one of high density but this development will be ten storeys high in the middle of Ringsend.  The quality of people's lives will be affected.  The problem is that when developers are defeated at An Bord Pleanála they simply resubmit the plans.  They have done so in St. Anne's.  They know that they will eventually get what they want.  It may be cut down in size but they will get what they want.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the way in which planning decisions are made.  We know local councillors have very little power.  We can make recommendations at a planning committee but that is about it.  After that the planners make the decision.  I understand how this process evolved.  Sections 4s and rezoning brought the planning process and councillors into disrepute.  However, in some instances we can give power back to councillors. The problem was often that the old trick was played whereby councillors who were not living in the area and not affected by developments made rezoning decisions.  Those councillors who lived in the area could claim they did their best and voted against the application.  We must look at a process which involves councillors in the area.  They are directly accountable to the people. This should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>It was extremely regrettable that the powers of planning and the environment were separated when the EPA was set up.  This was retrogressive but deliberate.  It was seen that environmentalists were holding up developments, particularly in Cork.  The name of the EPA suggests it is an environmental protection agency.  However, as we know it is an industrial licensing authority.  We need to look at this situation and introduce an EPA review Bill.</P>
    <P>Planning decisions often require an environmental impact statement.  These require the involvement of environmental consultants costing about £320 per day.  Communities are often not able to afford that money.  My experience as a Deputy has been that those parts of the community which are well heeled often mount elaborate objections to developments.  They can hire the best lawyers and environmental consultants. However, other parts of the constituency which do not have much money are left to stew and often get the high developments.  That has been the case in Pearse Street and Ringsend where huge developments have taken place.  This is unacceptable.  The impact of the ensuing traffic on people's lives is often not taken into account. <Col N="695" /> Huge developments involving more than 600 car spaces in a confined area will result in a huge increase in traffic volumes.  We are not looking seriously at this issue when examining planning developments.</P>
    <P>We are concentrating on the big developments. However, there is a problem with the planning provisions involving retention of use.  In confined areas we often see that, in order to maximise profits, small developers expand a property by building an extension.  Very often they do not seek planning permission.  They go ahead and build and then seek retention of use.  This happens frequently to the great annoyance of many people in my constituency but very little can be done about it.</P>
    <P>I have been told by those in the enforcement section of Dublin Corporation that when they go to court the judge is not interested.  The enforcement officers have given up the ghost in relation to retention of use and enforcement of conditions. Conditions are often not enforced yet officers will not go to court because judges simply throw out the case.  If we are reviewing planning, this is an area of much concern to many people.</P>
    <P>In the long-term if we are to talk about good planning and the maintenance of the quality of life for people in this city, we have to think about CPOs.  We have them for roads, so why not for parks?  Why can we not preserve the green spaces in our city?  There are some very nice parks in Dublin South East but the institutional lands are being eaten up by developments.  Government has not given this sufficient thought.  If we are to preserve green spaces and quality of life we must look at the way we use and develop land so that we have ecologically sustainable development. That is not happening and I hope it will be addressed in the forthcoming review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: This Bill deals with an increase in the board numbers of An Bord Pleanála and is very narrow in that it addresses that single issue.  I would have welcomed the opportunity, had the Government taken it, of a much wider consideration of the planning issue and addressing some of the issues which have dramatically come to the fore in recent years concerning planning matters.  In particular I would have welcomed proposals for making the planning process more democratic by giving local communities affected by serious decisions more weight through the provision of new structures. In many well publicised cases we have seen autocratic decisions being made by An Bord Pleanála when it was clear that the communities which would be most affected were totally opposed to such decisions.  The proposed Sonas Centre at the Phoenix Park racecourse is a case in point.  That <Col N="696" /> dramatic development on a substantial scale would have had a huge effect on the environment of a built up and highly populated area and severe social effects in the context of the type of gambling proposed.  Despite the massive scale of objections and the rejection of the proposal by the local authority, An Bord Pleanála saw fit to grant permission to the development.  That development would have been foisted on the community were it not for the fact that the Government felt it could not proceed, politically, to licence slot machines and gambling to such an extent.  Many other instances could be cited.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many controversies have arisen because councillors, who have a crucial part in the planning process, instead of representing the community and ordinary people, are driven by big business interests, particularly by developers and those who stand to make a killing from speculation and from building, etc., often irrespective of the consequences, for example, of the type of rezoning decisions put through by councillors in opposition to communities.</P>
      <P>A current controversy which has surfaced in the past few days and which illustrates the need for a more democratic process is the issue relating to mobile phone masts on Garda stations. Because of a deal between a private company and the Garda, an attempt is being made to foist microwave transmitters on many communities without them having any right to participate in the process and stronger transmitters can be installed without consultation with the communities. This is totally unacceptable and is causing huge concern in towns and villages throughout the country.  Quite properly, people are objecting to this.  A related objectionable development is the corporatism by which a private company has a deal with the Garda, one of the key State authorities, to provide mobile phones for senior gardaí.  This closeness between a private company and what is supposed to be a totally independent arm of the State should be opposed.  Communities living beside Garda stations must have a right enshrined in the structures and procedures whereby their voices can be heard.  This is lacking at present and I hope new proposals will be brought forward on this matter.</P>
      <P>The issue of planning is coming increasingly under scrutiny by virtue of the experiences confronting many communities on an annual basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter, which is of vital importance to my constituency, particularly the south of the constituency. The trouble for this area began in the late 1970s and early 1980s when there were major job <Col N="697" /> losses.  From having approximately 12 active industries with a high level of employment, the problem began with the closure of Irish Board Mills Limited with the loss of approximately 150 jobs.  This was followed by the closure of IVI with a similar loss of employment.  The downward trend continued with the closures of Sherwood Medical Limited and Pymah and dramatic reductions in the workforce of Bord na Móna and a number of other industries such as Peerless, Sportswear Limited., Minch Norton and others. In each case the losses were due to economic factors and not the unfortunate workforce.  The workforce available is of the highest calibre.</P>
      <P>The news in relation to Borden Limited is a cause of despair.  I was an employee of Borden for the past 13 years.  The possible loss of a further 60 jobs would decimate south Kildare, particularly Athy.  It would be the fifth industry to close in the area without any replacement being found.  I ask the Minister to make every effort to tease out all avenues in an effort to save the company.  A community cannot sustain such losses.  I cannot sufficiently impress upon the Minister the effect the closure of Borden would have.</P>
      <P>The education system in Athy is excellent with good schools, committed teachers and strong support structures within the schools, all helping to prepare the child to become a student.  Unfortunately there is nothing in the area to complete the cycle by ensuring the student becomes a member of the workforce.  The unemployment figures for the area show no reduction.  Comparison of the 1990 and 1996 figures shows an increase in unemployment for the area which goes against the national trend.  As elected representatives, we cannot permit this to continue.  We must ensure every effort is made to rectify it and that Athy is no longer an unemployment blackspot.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the Minister puts in place a task force of the relevant State agencies and local representatives and organisations, such as trade councils, development associations, the chamber of commerce and the local UDC.  This local input is vital to ensure everything possible is done to put all local information and ideas regarding possible investment in the area at the disposal of the Department and the State agencies.</P>
      <P>I have met the chief executive officer of Forbairt, the regional directors of the IDA Ireland and Forbairt, the Kildare County Manager, the ASK Partnership board of directors and many others in an attempt to further the efforts of this area in obtaining further investment in industry. However, this fragmented method is not achieving short-term results, although I believe these efforts will result in long-term advantages.</P>
      <P>The intervention of the Minister is important. I ask that the Minister establish the task force as a matter of urgency in order to end the decline and to help Athy regain its rightful place as an area of high employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I wish to assure the House that I share his concerns on the future of the Borden factory in Athy.</P>
      <P>I wish to briefly set out, for the information of the House, the background to the difficulties facing the plant.  Borden International produces milk powder and is second to Nestlé, the multinational conglomerate, in this global market.  The company has two facilities in Ireland, situated in Mallow and Athy, with approximately 60 people employed in each plant.</P>
      <P>The Mallow plant purchases milk powder and cans it.  The plant in Athy manufactures metal cans and sells a major proportion of its output to the Mallow facility which, I understand, will be closed as a result of the agreement by Nestlé to acquire Borden International's milk powder interests.  This means that the Athy plant will lose its largest customer, thus jeopardising employment there.</P>
      <P>Forbairt is working closely with Borden and other interests in order to secure the future of the Athy factory and maintain employment to the maximum extent possible.  The Deputy can rest assured that everything possible is being done to safeguard employment at the plant.</P>
      <P>The other two companies mentioned by Deputy Wall have been closed for some time. IDA Ireland continues its efforts to find a replacement industry.  In the case of the former Sherwood Athy plant, there have been a number of recent site visits by interested overseas investors to the facility.</P>
      <P>On the general question of employment in South Kildare and Deputy Wall's suggestion of a task force for that area, I would point out that a considerable amount of work is being done by the industrial development agencies in conjunction with community and local authority representatives in the area to promote the establishment and expansion of industrial projects.  Negotiations are ongoing between IDA Ireland and interested parties in relation to the provision of an advance factory in Athy.  Also, planning permission is currently begin sought for a new privately funded advance factory at Newbridge which, when occupied, will have a positive impact on employment opportunities for the southern region of the county.</P>
      <P>As regards County Kildare generally, I should point out that the county does well in the matter of job creation.  The recent Forfás employment survey shows that in terms of both net change and first time jobs, Kildare had the second best outturn after Dublin.  The continued expansion of major companies located in County Kildare, such as Intel, Hewlett Packard, Wyeth Medica, Modus Media, Oral B and Donnelly Mirrors, indicates a strong growth expectation for 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also of interest to note that although some of the traditional large employers in the food sector in County Kildare have reduced their employment levels, new companies, now leaders in the <Col N="699" /> consumer product market, have been established and have created new employment.</P>
    <P>The development agencies are working closely with industry and local interests to promote industrial development in the South Kildare region through the attraction of new industry and the expansion of existing industry.  In the light of current developments, the agencies are intensifying their efforts to facilitate additional investment, job creation and job maintenance in this region.  Given this ongoing work, I am not convinced that the establishment of a specific task force for the region is required to address the current problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this important matter and I apologise to him and Members of the House for having been unavoidably detained.</P>
      <P>Although this matter involving the dispute at Ryanair and the numbers involved in it may be relatively small, the issues involved are, I believe, of enormous importance.  If not resolved, they have the capacity to inflict significant damage on our industrial relations procedures and to undermine the entire system of social partnership on which so much of the country's recent economic success has been built.  Indeed, the generation of such negative publicity in an otherwise stable industrial environment can only have adverse implications for the ongoing work of IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is shocking that, as we approach the end of the twentieth century, a very successful and profitable Irish company should be refusing to recognise the right of its employees to join, and be represented by, the trade union of their choice. Regrettably, Ryanair's attitude to industrial relations seems to be rooted in the Victorian era and contrary to all the best management practices. The latest development in this dispute &mdash; the refusal of Ryanair to accept an invitation to attend at the Labour Court &mdash; suggests the company is not only prepared to deny workers what most people would regard as a fundamental human right, but is also thumbing its nose at the institutions established by the State to try to resolve industrial relations problems.  This is not a normal industrial relations dispute in which a Government would be expected to maintain a neutral position.  What is involved here is an issue of principle &mdash; the right of workers to join, and be represented by, a trade union if that is their <Col N="700" /> wish.  It is a principle the Government should actively seek to uphold.</P>
    <P>The right to join a trade union is enshrined in the Constitution but this right is rendered virtually meaningless if employers such as Ryanair are permitted to use their power to frustrate the exercise of that right.  The Ryanair case is not directly comparable with international companies located here which generally pay their workers above the odds, in stark contrast to the Ryanair policy.  The treatment of its workers in Ryanair also stands in stark contrast to its treatment of the company's directors who were paid £23.65 million between 1995 and flotation.  Ryanair's chief executive, Mr. O'Leary, who is responsible for the macho stands towards SIPTU, made an immediate killing of £17 million on the flotation.</P>
    <P>Much of this country's recent economic success has occurred as a result of social partnership and one of the positive spin-offs from this has been a significant decline in the number of industrial disputes.  Social partnership will not continue unless it is translated to the workplace.  It seems that a small number of employers, including Ryanair, and a number of multinationals are prepared to put the partnership approach at risk in their desire to see the industrial relations clock turned back.</P>
    <P>When Ryanair was a young company struggling to get off the ground, direct intervention by the State with regard to access to routes contributed enormously to its survival and growth.  The junior partner in this Government often point to Ryanair as the kind of company which emerged as a direct result of the deregulation policy it promoted in the late 1980s.  Now that it is a very successful company making huge profits, it is not unreasonable that the Government should ask it to abide by the industrial relations norms of the State.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that, despite its generally honourable role in social partnership, IBEC should be backing the stance of Ryanair.  It is a short-sighted position because if this dispute is not resolved, it could well reap an industrial relations whirlwind which employers may come to regret.  The position of SIPTU and the Ryanair workers has, on the other hand, been cautious and generally responsible.  Industrial action was only resorted to after a long period when the union was unable to get the company to open negotiations of any kind about the wages and conditions of its members.  When it was felt that industrial action was the only option, that action was of a limited nature.  Plans to escalate action were deferred when the chairperson of the Labour Court, Evelyn Owens, extended an invitation to both parties to come before the court.</P>
    <P>Against this background and the exceptional issues involved, a much more proactive position is required by the Government.  It cannot stand aloof.  Moral and practical pressure must be exerted on the company to come to the negotiating table.  A very strong public Government statement <Col N="701" /> of disapproval at the company's approach would be a start.</P>
    <P>Airline customers should exercise the options open to them to show their disapproval of the company's position by refusing to travel on Ryanair flights while the dispute continues.  Departments are also major users of air transport and they, too, should exercise a similar right of choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this important issue and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it, however briefly, on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I understand approximately 50 ground handling staff employed by Ryanair have joined the SIPTU trade union.  The union wrote to the company before Christmas seeking improved pay rates and working conditions for its members.  The company refused to meet SIPTU to negotiate the issues in dispute.  Its position is that it prefers to deal directly with its staff of 950 on such issues.</P>
      <P>The ground handling staff who are members of SIPTU voted in favour of industrial action which commenced on Friday, 9 January.  I understand some 35, or perhaps fewer, staff are engaged in work stoppages for three hours per shift.  There are conflicting statements from the company and SIPTU as to the effect on the airline's flight schedule.  There are also counter claims concerning the pay rates of ground handling staff employed in other companies and those employed in Ryanair.  Last weekend I encouraged the parties to use the labour relations machinery to overcome differences, even in relation to the facts on pay and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>On Monday the Labour Court invited the company and SIPTU to separate meetings on Friday, 30 January.  Ryanair notified the Labour Court on 28 January that it will not accept the invitation to attend.  I am informed that SIPTU will attend the Labour Court on Friday.  Ryanair's decision not to attend the Labour Court tomorrow is disappointing. It is not in the interest of the parties to this dispute that it should be prolonged.  The invitation by the Labour Court to the parties provided an opportunity for them to state their case to an independent third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have an impressive track record in helping parties to a dispute find a resolution. They provide tactful and helpful mediation.  I was particularly disappointed Ryanair did not see the powerful possibility to solve the basic issues the court could have provided.  In the final analysis, no third party can solve a dispute.  There is no way the parties in a dispute such as this can be forced to accept particular outcomes, recommendations or even a clarification provided by a mediator.  Where there are wide differences between the parties in a dispute on matters of fact, either the parties themselves, or an outside party, should set about establishing the facts.  I do not see that happening in this case.  I want to hear from Ryanair that it and its employees are <Col N="702" /> engaged in a dialogue on a fair and open basis.  I am still convinced that dialogue, especially if mediated by the Labour Court, could assist in arriving at clarification on the grounds for the dispute and could contribute to a solution.</P>
    <P>The issues in this dispute are sensitive and the parties to the dispute are required to reflect carefully on their actions.  It is time for cool heads all round.</P>
    <P>I have been carefully monitoring developments in this dispute and have encouraged the parties to seek a resolution at the earliest opportunity.  I will continue to make whatever contacts are necessary to encourage the parties to reach a settlement.  The State's dispute settlement machinery remains available to them.  I urge the company to reconsider its decision not to attend the Labour Court tomorrow</P>
    <P>The process of social partnership has benefited our economy greatly, particularly in the past ten years.  ICTU and the trade union movement have contributed substantially in an enlightened way to that process.  As a result, the economy and the people have benefited.  The process of partnership should be put into practice in this dispute.  I urge the parties to find a resolution through the process of dialogue and I would like to see evidence of that in the crucial days ahead.</P>

    <P>Páirteanna ruibeair do thionscal na gcárranna atá á dtairgeadh acu agus ó thárla tionscal na ngluaisteán a bheith chomh láidir bríomhar sin faoi láthair níor shamhail éinne go dtiocfadh ráiteas tubaisteach na seachtaine seo caite.  Bhí infheistíocht iomlán de £14 millúin déanta sa chomhlacht agus go dtí seo tuigim go bhfuil deontais beagnach £5 millúin díolta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta leo.  Ní thuigeann duine ar bith dár casadh orm cén chúis atá leis na deacrachtaí a deir an bhainistíocht atá acu.  Tá éileamh láidir ar an táirge.  Tá na hoibrithe oilte, cumasach agus <Col N="703" /> dílis dá gcuid postanna agus don mhonarcha.  Ach mar sin féin scaoiltear suas le 130 chun bóthair.</P>
    <P>Sé an t-aon leithscéal atá ag an chomhlacht ná go bhfuil iomaíocht ghéar ó thíortha in Oirthear na hEorpa, macasamhail Latvia, An Phólainn, an tSeicoslóvaic agus ó thíortha eile mar sin.  Ach nach sílfeadh duine ar bith réasúnta go dtuigfeadh an comhlacht sin agus go n-aithneodh siad na deacrachtaí cúpla bliain ó shin agus iad ag teacht isteach go dtí an ceantar?</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil ceisteanna práinneacha le freagairt ag an chomhlacht.  Cé mhéid monarcha eile atá druidte acu le cúpla bliain?  Tháinig siad amach as Albain cúpla bliain ó shin agus tháinig siad amach as tionscal a bhí acu i mBéal Átha Seanaigh a bhí ag tairgeadh an rud céanna atá á thairgeadh i nGaoth Dobhair i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfa a rá go bhfuil sé mar nós acu dul ó áit go háit ag oscailt agus ag druid monarcha nuair a oireann sin dóibh gan aird a thabhairt ar an chruatan a fhágann siad in a ndiaidh.  Faoi cheann cúpla mí beidh níos mó ná leath de na hoibrithe ligthe chun bealaigh agus gan fhios acu cá bhfaighidh siad post eile.  Daoine óga a bhfurmhór a bhfuil cúramaí teaghlaigh agus freagrachtaí mórgáistí ar go leor acu.</P>
    <P>Tá dualgas orainn uilig gach dícheall a dhéanamh fostaíocht agus obair eile a chur ar fáil dóibh. Mura ndéanfar sin agus mura ndéanfar é gan mhoill is eagal liom nach bhfuil i ndán dóibh ach an bád.  Chomh maith leis sin tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go gcosnófar agus go gcaomhnófar na postanna atá fágtha sa mhonarcha.</P>
    <P>Le blianta anuas bhí Eastát Tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair aitheanta mar an seod ba lionnrí i gcoróin an Údaráis agus na Gaeltachta.  Le trí mhí anuas áfach tá dhá chéad agus dhá scór post caillte ansin &mdash; 60 i BMR i mi Dheireadh Fómhair seo caite; 50 i Europlast roimh an Nollaig agus anois 130 in RMT.  Is mór an buille é sin ní hamháin do na tionscail ach do na hoibrithe atá ag cailleadh a gcuid postanna agus fosta d'ár muinín agus d'ár ndóchas san Eastát féin.</P>
    <P>Tá géarghá le beart a chuirfeadh muinín agus dóchas arais ní hamháin i dtionscal RMT ach san Eastát ar fad.  Is ar an Údarás agus ar an Roinn atá na dualgais sin agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire achan tacaíocht is gá a thabhairt leis na postanna atá fágtha a chosaint agus a chaomhnú agus fostaíocht bhreise a bhunú le déanamh suas ar son an méid atá caillte ansin le cúpla mí anuas.</P>

      <P>Údar diomá dom gurb é seo an dara huair go raibh ar an Teachta McGinley ceist a ardú maidir le monarcha i dTir Chonaill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé fógraithe ag Rubar Mótair Teoranta (RMT) go bhfuiltear chun athstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar ghnó an chomhlachta i nGaoth Dobhair. Is é an cuspóir atá leis an athstruchtúrú sin ná an comhlacht a chur ar ais ar bhonn brabúis tar éis na gcailteanas troma a d'fhulaing sé le roinnt blianta anuas.  Tá i gceist an fhostaíocht a laghdú ó <Col N="704" /> 217 nduine lánaimseartha go 114 dhuine lánaimseartha idir seo agus mí Mheán Fómhair seo chugainn mar chuid den athstruchtúrú sin.  Is cúis mhór dhíomá dom go bhfuil gá leis an laghdú mór sin a dhéanamh san fhostaíocht in RMT (anuas ar dhúnadh Europlast sa cheantar céanna le déanaí) ach is léir go raibh gníomh athcheartaithe riachtanach chun todhchaí an chomhlachta a chosaint.</P>
    <P>Tá cúiseanna ar leith ann do na fadhbanna atá ag an gcomhlacht seo.  Páirteanna rubair don tionscal mótair atá á dtáirgeadh aige agus tá sé neamheacnamúil leanúint ar aghaidh le sraith amháin de na páirteanna sin a tháirgeadh.  Tá an comhlacht ag feidhmiú in earnáil a bhfuil iomaíocht ghéar inti agus tá brúnna breise iomaíochta tagtha chun cinn ó thíortha nua daonlathacha Oirthir na hEorpa.  Ar ndoigh ní móran sóláis é sin don lucht oibre a chaillfidh a gcuid post.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go raibh cainteanna leanúnacha ar siúl idir an tÚdarás agus an comhlacht agus go deimhin leis an máthairchomhlacht sa Ghearmáin le cúpla mí anuas mar ba léir go raibh gá le beartas athcheartaithe chun todhchaí an chomhlachta go ginearálta a bhuanú.</P>
    <P>Is iad na dúshláin atá romhainn mar sin ná:</P>
    <P>&mdash;gach dícheall a dhéanamh chun todhchaí an chomhlachta a bhuanú, na poist a bheidh fágtha a chosaint agus cur leo arís más féidir; agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;leanacht leis na hiarrachtaí chun deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chur ar fáil i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair do na daoine a chaill poist le déanaí, don lucht oibre a chaillfidh poist i rith na bliana seo nuair a scaoilfear leo ó Rubar Mótair agus dóibh siúd atá ar fáil le haghaidh fostaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá an tÚdarás dóchasach go mbeidh an bunús nua trádála &mdash; atá dírithe ar an gcomhlacht a chur ar ais ar bhunús brabúsmhar &mdash; mar dhúsraith do mhéadú fostaíochta arís amach anseo.  Chuige sin tá an tÚdarás i dteagmháil leanúnach leis an máthairchomhlacht agus é mar chuspóir aige an líon is mó is féidir de na poist sa tionscal a shábháil i gcomhréir leis na céimeanna atá riachtanach chun RMT a chur ar ais ar bhonn brabúis.  Ar ndóigh tá mé féin agus mo Roinn-se ar fáil chun cibé cúnamh is féidir a thabhairt d'iarrachtaí an Údaráis.  Tá socraithe agam taisteal go dtí an Ghearmáin go luath in éineacht le Príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis chun bualadh leis na príomhaithe thall ansin d'fhonn a chur ina luí orthu cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an comhlacht seo do cheantar Ghaoth Dobhair.</P>
    <P>Tá cúnamh substaintiúil curtha ar fáil don chomhlacht ag an Stát tríd an Údarás.  Ceadaíodh breis is £6m i ndeontais (a bhfuil breis is £5m den tsuim sin íoctha) agus tógadh monarcha nua dó ar chostas de £2.5m. Ní amháin nár baineadh amach an sprioc fostaíochta de 330 dhuine a bhí i gceist ag an am a ceadaíodh an togra ach tá an fhostaíocht de 217 nduine atá ann faoi láthair le laghdú go dtí 114 dhuine.  Ní fhéadfadh aon duine ach a bheith míshásta agus buartha faoin gcor sin <Col N="705" /> ar an scéal agus caithfear ceachtanna a fhoghlaim uaidh.  Ar an taobh eile den scéal beidh RMT ina mhórfhostóir fós i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill agus is den riachtanas é go leanfaidh an tÚdarás ag oibriú i gcomhar leis chun a thodhchaí a bhuanú agus chun bunús fáis brabúis agus fostaíochta a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Tá dea-scéal ann freisin do Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  Tuigim ón Údarás go mbeidh tograí áirithe atá ceadaithe cheana féin ag teacht chun cinn i rith 1998 le fostaíocht bhreise shuntasach sa treis iontu.  Faoi mar is eol don Teachta, ní foláir, tá togra nua aimsithe ag an Údarás chun dul i mbun trádála i mí Feabhra in áit Europlast Teo agus tuigim go bhfuil sprioc fostaíochta de 29 bpost i gceist.  Chomh maith leis sin tá tograí eile ceadaithe a chuirfidh timpeall 150 post ar fáil i nGaeltacht Ghaoth Dobhair ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol. Is ionann sin is a rá, le cúnamh Dé, beidh na postanna nua a chruthofar níos líonmhaire ná na postanna atá á gcailleadh, rud atá an-thábhachtach don cheantar.  Maidir leis an moladh gur cheart tascfhórsa a bhunú chun tionscail ionad a aimisú do Ghaoth Dobair ní fheicim go mbeadh táirbhe ina leithéide ó tharla go bhfuil an tÚdarás cheana féin ag feidhmiú go héifeachtach leis an droch thionchúr a bheidh ag an dúnadh a mhaolú agus ag féachaint do na poist nua a bheidh ag teacht ar aghaidh sa cheantar i mbliana.  Táim sásta go bhfuil na hacmhainní foirne agus airgeadais is gá ag an Údarás chun deiseanna fostaíochta breise a aimsiú do mhuintir an cheantair. Sa chomhtheacs sin níor mhiste a rá go mbeidh breis is £21 milliún ar fáil don tÚdarás i mbliana trí Vóta mo Roinne le haghaidh caiteachas caipitil. Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith dearfach de, rud ar bith is féidir a dhéanamh déanfar é agus go mórmhór déanfar cinnte de chomh fada agus is féidir go dtabharfar chuile cúnamh do na hoibrithe a chaill a gcuid postanna, cinn nua a fháil. Tá mé taréis béim a chur ar sin sna comhráití a bhí agam le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to raise the issue of legislation on mobile telephone masts with the Taoiseach on many occasions on the Order of Business.  His response up to yesterday has been muted.  In my constituency, Dublin South-East, I have assisted residents in successfully opposing proposals to erect masts in the Sandymount area made by Eircell and Esat Digifone.  I oppose such masts mainly because of the potential health hazards and this is an aspect I wish to address in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a more disquieting aspect to the agreement between Esat Digifone and the Garda Síochána.  It sets an important precedent.  Essentially, those charged with upholding the law have entered into a sponsorship deal with Esat Digifone. According to a spokesman for Esat Digifone this is a &ldquo;win win&rdquo; situation and I am sure it is from Esat Digifone's business perspective. However, from an ethical point of view there are <Col N="706" /> serious questions to be asked.  Will the Garda uniforms made by Dunnes Stores display the St. Bernard logo?  Will certain car companies sponsor the Garda fleet or will the Garda cars display advertising?  How long will it be before Coca-Cola and Nike get in on the act?  In short, are we seeing the commercialisation of the Garda?</P>
    <P>Apparently, senior gardaí will do well out of the deal through the provision of free mobile 'phones and they will be able to communicate free of charge within the system.  A letter from Assistant Commissioner T.P. Fitzgerald of Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park to the chief superintendent of the Laoighis-Offaly district, dated 30 December 1997, contained the following implied threat:</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the Commissioner, under the SMI bottom-up review, will have difficulty recommending the continued existence of a rural station where efforts to make the necessary improvements in the communications system is being thwarted.</P>
    <P>A Garda spokesperson has since denied that this letter was a threat.  It was said that it was sent to divisional officers for information and education purposes only.  The Assistant Commissioner makes a direct reference in his letter to a Garda station in Offaly where the erection of an Esat Digifone mast has been objected to by Mrs. Teresa Direen, the wife of a local garda.  I compliment Mrs. Direen on her stance.  We live in a democracy and she has a right to object to any structure which she believes will cause potential health hazards for her family and her locality. Hers is a prudent approach, as is that of Mr. Kieran McDermott of the Garda Representative Association in Laoighis-Offaly who has pointed out that there is concern among gardaí about the health effects of radio masts.</P>
    <P>More evidence is coming to light of the effects of non-ionising radiation.  There are some who claim that the jury is still out on the issue and if that is the case we should employ the precautionary principle.  As used among environmentalists the precautionary principle is &ldquo;If in doubt, leave it out&rdquo;&mdash; if there is any potential danger we should not proceed.  There is circumstantial evidence to give cause for concern.  An Australian study carried out last year found a doubling of cancers of the lymphoid tissue in mice after exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile 'phones.  A study by Washington State University has shown increased DNA damage to rats exposed to radio frequency microwaves. There are those who argue that such studies cannot be applied to humans.  However, they indicate that we must be cautious.</P>
    <P>The standards of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection are adhered to in this country, but a recent study discredits its standards.  It shows that they are not adequate and do not offer protection.  The study, carried out by Professor Kruger, noted sleep disturbance <Col N="707" /> at levels 100,000 times lower than these standards.</P>
    <P>He should be invited to this country for the conference on 6 March which will consider this very important subject.  It was discussed this morning at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
    <P>We have had much experience on the issue of negligence.  We have seen what happened during the blood transfusion scandal and what has happened on the issue of hearing loss claims by soldiers. We cannot afford to be negligent in this case. I support the Garda Representative Association. It is right to be prudent and its members and their families have a right to object to these masts.  Esat Digifone is seeking to bypass the planning process by piggybacking on the sites in Garda stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachtaí as ucht na ceiste seo a thógáil.  Tá mé anseo ag freagairt thar ceann an Aire Dlí agus Cirt.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform welcomes this opportunity to clear up what would appear to be a degree of misunderstanding about the nature of the deal whereby Esat Digifone has been permitted to use Garda radio masts or sites.  The arrangements with the company is on a fully commercial basis whereby the company will pay to the State the full rental value of the Garda sites it uses.  The arrangement provides the Garda with strategically significant benefits with regard to their communication needs which will lessen, but not remove, the need for a significant Exchequer investment in developing the Garda communication system. The contract with the company obliges it to comply fully with planning requirements and with established health and safety criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement arose from an approach made to the Garda authorities by Esat Digifone in September 1996 with a proposal to share their radio masts in the context of the company's planned mobile telephone network.  The Garda authorities considered the arrangements proposed by the company to be technically feasible and of significant benefit to the Garda in terms of their own plans for the future development of <Col N="708" /> their radio and telecommunications network. Given the strong support for the proposal by the Garda authorities and mindful of the desire to avoid the proliferation of such masts, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to the company complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a contractual agreement was concluded with Esat Digifone in early 1997 under which it is permitted to use up to 450 out of a total of 704 Garda station sites.  In return, the company is paying full commercial rent for access to the sites and providing certain services to the Garda Síochána.  Some of the services available to the Garda are of significant strategic importance to them.  In this regard and in the context of a recently completed detailed proposal concerning the provision of a new Garda radio system, Garda management has indicated that the likely cost of such a system would be of the order of £76 million.  However, arising from the contract with the company, it is estimated these costs could be reduced by up to 25 per cent.  Of this amount, the value of mast replacements to be undertaken by the company would be approximately half, with the remainder being made up by way of access to the company's hilltop sites and the provision of radio links on the network.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware there is concern in some communities about the safety of mobile telephone technology.  He wishes to emphasise that he fully accepts the right of people who may have such concerns to raise their views and to seek explanations and assurances.  He wishes to point out that careful and detailed consideration was given to the Esat Digifone proposal and that the agreement with the company is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment. Should any doubts arise in this regard, it would be a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the relevant planning authorities to consider.</P>
    <P>Arís ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachtaí as ucht na ceiste seo a chur síos.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 February 1998.</P>

      <P>The health and social costs of alcohol abuse are well established and concern about the impact of such abuse led to the development of a national alcohol policy, which was launched in September, 1996.</P>
      <P>The National Alcohol Policy was drawn up after an extensive consultative process and is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption.  Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the action plan sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.  The Government adopted the policy, which is now being implemented.  It will take some time to fully implement the plan, and it will be some years before its impact can be measured.  In the meantime it is unlikely that I will be proposing to Government any action which is not part of the policy.  The wide range of initiatives and measures in the Policy's Action Plan does not include a ban on advertising of alcohol.  I do not, therefore, intend to suggest to Government the introduction of such a ban at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of national cancer screening programmes is a major undertaking which requires careful planning and organisation.  From my Department's perspective, of particular concern is the need to achieve acceptable compliance levels and at the same time to satisfy the necessary quality assurance criteria.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of national breast and cervical cancer screening programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major challenge facing both programmes was the need to establish a named population register which would comply with the data protection requirements.  However, I am pleased to say that following the passage of the Health Provision No. 3 Act 1997 and subsequent correspondence <Col N="710" /> with the Data Protection Commissioner, we are now in a position to proceed with the establishment of registers for the two programmes. Work is well advanced on this issue and it is hoped to have the registers in place by April-May 1998.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the Cancer Action Plan, there have been a number of other important developments.  In relation to breast screening, these include: the establishment of a National Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, to guide the implementation of the National Programme of Screening for Breast Cancer; the establishment of a National Quality Assurance Committee, chaired by Professor Ennis, Consultant Radiologist, Mater Hospital, as a subcommittee of the steering group.  The committee is representative of experts from all the relevant clincial disciplines; the decision to appoint a project director for the programme.  Dr. Jane Buttimer, Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health and Children was appointed as project director for the programme in December 1997 and will take up her duties shortly.</P>
    <P>A key development in recent months was a decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for phase I of the programme. It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  In addition, there will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote-rural areas within the three health boards in phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
    <P>In relation to cervical screening, an advisory committee has been set up to oversee the establishment of a pilot programme.  It is considered necessary to plot the cervical screening programme to identify and resolve any difficulties which may arise.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the lead in time involved in the development of IT systems, the establishment of the population registers and the recruitment of consultant and support staff, I am advised that we should be in a position to start both screening programmes by September 1998.  I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programmes to facilitate the commencement of screening in 1998.  Substantial funding has been made available in 1998 to meet the start up costs for both programmes.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a draft report on the research undertaken by the Department of Sociology, Trinity College Dublin.  The report is a complex one and addresses the factors which contribute to unwanted pregnancy, the factors which lead some women to choose the option of abortion and those which lead other women to continue with their pregnancy.  Some final editing work is currently being undertaken by the Trinity College research team and it is my intention to have the study published as soon as possible after this work has been completed.  The Government decided on 2 December 1997 to establish a Cabinet Committee which will oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task it will be to prepare a Green Paper on the issue of abortion.  This process will involve consideration of the constitutional, legal, medical, moral, social and ethical issues which arise regarding abortion. It would not therefore be appropriate at this stage to exclude any option from consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the substantive recommendations of the Kilkenny incest investigation that relate to health services. The central recommendation, i.e. that the Child Care Act, 1991 be implemented in full, has been achieved.  Since 1993, and up to the end of 1997 £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been <Col N="712" /> invested in developing an infrastructure to support the Act.  Among the other main recommendations of the report relating to the health services and implemented to date are: the introduction of a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and Garda; revised internal health board procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse; revised Medical Council guidelines on medical confidentiality in so far as it relates to child abuse; development of treatment services for children affected by abuse and expansion of community-based preventative and family support services, such as resource centres, homemakers, and community mothers schemes.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining substantive recommendations of the report that come within my Department's area of responsibility, the most important relate to mandatory reporting, revised child abuse guidelines, a national system for setting and monitoring child protection standards and standardised child abuse registers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mandatory Reporting and revised Child Abuse Guidelines</i>
      </P>
      <P>As I explained to the House last year I am adopting a broad approach to the issue of improving the reporting of child abuse.  The mandatory reporting of child abuse is a commitment in the programme for the Millennium which will be introduced in the life of the Government.  I regard it as essential that this be done in a way which will have wide support from the professions who will have to comply with the requirement and which will produce a reporting scheme that is effective, efficient and sensitive to the needs of children.  I also consider that considerable additional investment in our child care services will be required in advance of the introduction of mandatory reporting.  I have already announced my intention of continuing to progress the initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting of child abuse as outlined in &ldquo;Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children&rdquo;. At present I am in the process of establishing a working group to review the 1987 and 1995 child abuse guidelines.</P>
      <P>The above-mentioned working group to review the 1987 and 1995 child abuse guidelines will also examine the current procedures in place for the transfer of records between health boards.</P>
      <P>
        <i>National System for Monitoring Standards</i>
      </P>
      <P>The establishment of a Social Service Inspectorate is a priority for the Government.  The main function of the inspectorate should be to promote and ensure the development of quality standards in the personal social services.  It has been decided to proceed with the establishment of the inspectorate on an administrative basis initially and it will be located within the Department of Health and Children.  Advertisements for positions in the Inspectorate will be placed as soon as detailed arrangements for the establishment of the inspectorate have been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" />
      <i>Child Abuse Register</i>
    </P>
    <P>In relation to the child abuse registers, health boards currently maintain lists of suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines.  Their purpose is to monitor and follow up on reported cases of children at risk and to provide data for research and planning.  When families with children who are considered to be at risk change residence and move to another health board area, the information on the list is passed on to the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation acknowledged current practice in this regard and recommended the standardisation of child abuse registers and the introduction of certain safeguards into the system.  An examination of the current system of child abuse registers will be undertaken in the light of issues that arise in the review of the child abuse guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Kelly Fitzgerald report was a report to the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board and I will ask the Western Health Board to communicate with the Deputy regarding the recommendations that refer directly to that board.  With regard to those recommendations that are relevant to the Department of Health and Children I am arranging to have a detailed note prepared which I will forward to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Madonna House report the Deputy will recall that the report made important recommendations in relation to protecting the welfare of children in residential care and improving standards in the sector generally.  In view of the importance of the report's recommendations, they were published in full as an appendix to the Guide to Good Practice in Children's Residential Centres which was published in conjunction with the Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996.  These regulations, which came into operation on 31 December 1996, were circulated widely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 32 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved and authorised before being placed on the European market.  Foods and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within the scope of the regulation which came into effect in all member states in mid-May 1997.  Prior to this date, there was no legislation on novel foods in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Regulation 258/97 ensures that common rules and procedures in relation to the placing on the market of all novel foods and ingredients apply across all member states of the European Union. These controls are intended to provide protection to consumers.  A moratorium on the marketing of foods which contain genetically modified organisms would not be consistent with this EU legislation.</P>
      <P>Regulation 258/97 also contains provisions for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients. Essentially, there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.  These labelling requirements for novel foods are in addition to the general food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  These labelling provisions apply throughout the European Union.  The member states of the European Union with the European Commission are at present considering the detailed rules for the implementation of these labelling provisions.  I wish to assure the House that in any EU discussions I will press for genetically modified foods to be so labelled to ensure the highest degree of consumer information. Pending resolution of this discussion at EU level, I am aware that voluntary guidelines on the labelling of genetically modified products are being discussed by Irish industry.</P>
      <P>I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who has responsibility for EU legislation on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms, recently asked his Department to prepare a national position paper on this subject.  My Department will be happy to contribute to the food-related aspects of this exercise, which I understand will involve consultation with a wide variety of interests.  In advance of its completion, I will be keeping an open mind on future policy in the field of genetic modification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current policy adopted by the health services in relation to the care of older people as outlined in the Department's 1988 publication The Years Ahead, is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and when this is no longer possible, to ensure they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care.</P>
      <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People, the statutory advisory group set up to advise the Government on all matters affecting older people, recently published a comprehensive review of how this policy is being implemented. The review identified a number of areas where the level of services currently being provided were less than adequate.  Included in this category were certain aspects of the community care programme, and particularly care in the home.  There is clearly a need to improve the level of services provided in the home by nurses, nursing attendants, home helps and by a range of paramedical staff such as physiotherapists and speech therapists. Dependant older people who are able to stay at home should also be supported by good-quality day-care centres.  In addition, carers of older people need to be better supported and respite facilities need to be expanded.  I am endeavouring to boost these services as resources permit and, in this regard, the financial allocations to health boards for 1998 made provision for the opening of additional respite and day care centres and the employment of additional paramedical and nursing staff to support older people in their homes.  Priority has been given in 1998 to developing specialist mental health services for older people, which was one of the shortcomings identified by the council.</P>
      <P>A full review of the home help scheme by a team of independent researchers is well under way and will be completed by early summer. When I have received the report, I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the overall thrust of policy is to provide the necessary supports to enable them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. This year, additional resources have been provided for the development of services such as respite care, day and home supports, including personal assistants.  There has been a substantial investment in the development of services to persons with a mental handicap in recent years.  Particular attention has been paid in developing services <Col N="716" /> to the provision of support services for persons with a mental handicap living at home with their families so that individuals can continue to live in the community for as long as possible. In addition to the provision of new day services, additional respite care facilities have been put in place and the home support services, which were initiated in 1992, have been enhanced and expanded.  The home support services are intended to provide assistance to persons with a mental handicap and their families in a flexible manner and are designed to meet their individual circumstances.  It is proposed to continue to expand and enhance both the respite care and the home support services for persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <P>In the private medical insurance market, balance billing arises where insurers and service providers are unable to agree full reimbursement arrangements for the provision of services by the latter to the former's subscribers or members.  The parties endeavour to make such arrangements through normal commercial negotiations, with providers <Col N="717" /> seeking to obtain what they regard as an appropriate financial return for their services and insurers seeking to achieve what they regard as best value for money in order to contain increases in claims expenditure and, consequently, in premium costs generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years, a nutrition health promotion framework for action has been implemented by my Department to imrove the nutritional status of the Irish population and help reduce the incidence of diet related disease.  This has involved developments at community level, in schools, the workplace and health care facilities and has led to the establishment of community dietician posts, schools programmes, and healthy eating programmes in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's healthy eating policy <Col N="723" /> involves the ongoing promotion of the healthy eating guidelines which seek to encourage Irish people to eat a wide variety of foods in line with current recommendations.  This is achieved through ongoing healthy eating initiatives like National Healthy Eating Week, which focuses on a different theme each year.  The policy also embraces continuing nutrition education for health professionals and expanding community based healthy eating initiatives for lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The focus of the 1996 National Healthy Eating Week campaign was on eating more fruit and vegetables.  The current target consumption rates are four helpings of fruit and vegetables per day. An evaluation of that campaign showed that it resulted in an increased uptake of fruit and vegetable consumption.  Overall 92 per cent of those surveyed said that they eat at least one portion of vegetables per day and the average number of portions of fruit and vegetables, including fruit juice, eaten on a normal day is three.</P>
    <P>There are strong demand for the magazine issued by the Health Promotion Unit &ldquo;Eat more Fruit and Vegetable&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Food Pyramid&rdquo; poster is widely circulated.  Both of these highly regarded publications continue to inform public opinion regarding optimum fruit and vegetable intake.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently undertaking a national health and lifestyle survey.  This comprehensive survey will be broadly based, cross sectoral in relation to social class and will give data upon which outcomes and focuses of future campaigns can be measured and targeted.  This survey will also inform policy in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I have approved the establishment of a national disease surveillance unit.  The unit will, initially be established on a non-statutory basis for an interim period not exceeding three years.  During this period the unit will operate under the aegis of the Eastern Health Board following which it will be established on a statutory basis.  The management board under which the unit will operate has been appointed.  The first meeting of the board will be convened shortly to arrange the recruitment of the unit's director.</P>
      <P>The national disease surveillance unit will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease.  Initially it will be responsible for the surveillance of communicable diseases e.g. meningitis, tuberculosis, food-borne diseases and MRSA.</P>

      <P>I met senior management of the Eastern Health Board last year to discuss the delays in carrying out assessments of couples who wished to adopt children from abroad.  I am pleased to inform the House that arising from the additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998 the board has proposed, in its 1998 service plan, the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.  The service plan is being examined at present by my Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, services at St. Ita's Hospital are administered by the Eastern Health Board.  The board's current development plan in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provides for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with a reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service of St. Ita's.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm that I paid a visit to St. Ita's on 28 November, 1997 to view for myself the facilities and services provided at the hospital.  I have also met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the development of St. Ita's and the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of the campus.  Following my visit to the hospital, the management agreed to submit proposals to me in respect of the most urgent needs for the development of mental health facilities.  I will have these proposals given priority attention as soon as they have been finalised by the Eastern Health Board.  Plans in respect of the development of mental handicap services have already been received and are currently <Col N="726" /> being considered by my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the board are fully committed to the implementation of the overall development programme which will continue in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 is being funded as part of the ongoing process of the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Under the Regulations, pre-school providers were obliged to notify their local health board, by 30 June, 1997.  Health boards have established inspection teams and have started to inspect facilities on a phased basis. All pre-school services should be inspected by mid 1999 and inspections will take place on at least an annual basis hereafter.</P>
      <P>An additional £5 million was approved in 1997 for the development of child care services including the work in progress on the provisions of the inspection service provided for in the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations.  An additional £8 million has been approved in 1998 to strengthen child care services.  This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 in regard to pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. Child minders looking after less than three children were exempted from the provisions of Part VII of the Act in order to avoid interfering with arrangements made by working parents with a relative or neighbour, to look after their children for them.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  In the interim, a working group on the implementation of the regulations has been established by my Department.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Expert Group on Child Care, established under Partnership 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector, is currently examining the possible regulation of child minders in the home.  The expert <Col N="727" /> group, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is expected to issue its report in December 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C compensation tribunal has received 1,785 claims to date; 598 claims have been determined.  Of the remaining cases to be determined, 229 have been allocated hearing dates.  A further 347 cases are ready for hearing and most of these will be heard this year.  The remaining cases are not ready for hearing as all the necessary documentation has not yet been submitted to the tribunal.  The Deputy will be aware that a second division of the tribunal commenced hearings in July last year.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I will shortly be appointing four additional members to the tribunal which will increase the volume of cases determined by the tribunal and thus reduce the waiting period for hearings.</P>
      <P>In addition, pursuant to section 8 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, I made arrangements to provide for the settlement of claims in respect of general and special damages by a claimant.  The arrangements will operate as informally as possible and in a manner which ensures that settlement offers are made as early as possible.  These arrangements are specifically designed for persons who are seeking to have their compensation claims resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 53, 76, 88, 138 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>On taking office, I gave a personal commitment to review the recommendations of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group.  Today, after a little more than six months in office, I was pleased to announce today a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease.</P>
      <P>Cardiovascular disease, the term used to describe the associated diseases of the heart and circulatory system, is a major cause of premature mortality &mdash; persons under 65 &mdash; in Ireland, accounting for almost one-third of all premature deaths.  In 1996, 1,787 Irish people under 65 died from cardiovascular disease.  The mortality rate from ischaemic heart disease in the under 65 age group is approximately twice the EU average.  In addition to those who die prematurely from cardiovascular disease, many others suffer ill-health and a reduction in their quality of life.</P>
      <P>The information available to me on the incidence of heart disease and demographic trends suggests that cardiovascular disease will continue to present a major challenge in the years ahead. It is clear that if the target of the health strategy to reduce the death rate from cardiovascular disease in the under 65 age group by 30 per cent before 2005 is to be achieved, an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of the disease is an absolute requirement.  The development of a strategy for cardiovascular health is central to the achievement of this target.  Investment in cardiac treatment must be matched by an equivalent investment in improved prevention and primary care facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> To tackle this major public health problem, I have announced today a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at achieving such an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  The proposals are built around three key initiatives as follows: the establishment of a national strategy to improve cardiovascular health; the provision of additional public cardiac surgery facilities for adults and children to tackle the large backlog of approximately 1,650 patients awaiting surgery and to guarantee public hospital patients access to cardiac surgery within an average waiting period of six months of being placed on the waiting list, and the development of a heart/lung transplant programme for patients with cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Before I outline the details of the above proposals which I mentioned, I would like to commend the Mater Hospital for its sterling work over the years as the national cardiac unit and I would like to confirm that it will maintain its position as the national cardiac surgery unit and a centre of excellence for cardiovascular surgery.  It will retain its responsibility for treating the most complex surgical cases, including transplants and congenital heart conditions.  In line with this, it will be encouraged and supported in playing a more active leadership role in the ongoing organisation and development of all aspects of cardiac surgery care at the other centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I intend to appoint a cardiac health strategy group which will develop an integrated strategy on cardiovascular health by the middle of 1998. The membership of the group will include a cardiologist, a GP and a public health specialist.  The strategy is expected to cover preventive medical, surgical and rehabilitation services, health promotion and education initiatives to tackle risk factors, organisation and evaluation of services and ongoing research into the causes and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the overriding objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists.  From the latest information available, there were 1586 patients &mdash; adults and children &mdash; on the public cardiac surgery waiting list at the end of September 1997; 1,237 of these patients were awaiting by-pass surgery and the average waiting time for this procedure is two years.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the unacceptable waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels would be in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG.  This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent.  In addition, I intend to put in place additional cardiology <Col N="731" /> facilities at Cork University Hospital to augment the existing cardiac facilities there.</P>
    <P>The current situation whereby 70 per cent of children awaiting cardiac surgery have been waiting for longer than six months is unacceptable. Consequently, I am proposing to develop additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children.  This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to implement the Government's commitment to develop a heart and lung transplant service on a phased basis as follows: (i) by working to secure the best possible access to existing facilities in the UK for Irish patients. Alongside this, we will be improving the pre-operative and post-operative support for transplant candidates and also helping to ease the burden on those who have to travel abroad for surgery, as well as their carers; (ii) the establishment of a formal &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; link between a centre of excellence abroad and the Irish hospitals who will care for heart/lung transplant patients.  The Mater Hospital, with its expertise in heart transplantion, will be the designated surgical site for the heart/lung transplant programme in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, which is currently the national centre for cystic fibrosis; and (iii) It is proposed to commence lung and heart/lung transplant surgery as soon as the skills and resources in this country can offer a transplant programme which guarantees results which are at a minimum on a par with those achieved internationally.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the proposals which I have announced today will help to tackle the huge problem of cardiovascular disease in this country and specifically the issue of premature death from the disease.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 148 together.  I recently published the report of the methadone treatment services review group.  The group's report examines the protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and recommends the appropriate <Col N="732" /> controls which should be put in place to allow for the expansion of methadone treatment.</P>
      <P>The report makes a number of specific recommendations in relation to controlling the availability of methadone as follows: regulations should be introduced under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, which would require that the prescription and supply of methadone should be restricted to official prescription forms specifically designed for that purpose; treatment for opiate misuse should be provided in the drug misuser's own local area, wherever possible; there should be limits on the number of patients attending an individual doctor or pharmacy; general practitioners and pharmacists involved in prescribing and dispensing methadone should obtain relevant training and support.</P>
      <P>A working group has been established with membership drawn from my Department, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Eastern Health Board to drive the implementation of this report and I am confident that its implementation will result in strict control on the prescribing of methadone in the treatment of opiate misuse.</P>

    <P>**These figures do not include a sum of £1 million allocated to the local area task forces in 1997 arising from the ministerial task force reports on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  A further £2.3 million ia available to the Eastern Health Board in 1998 arising from once off expenditure of this amount in 1997.  This £2.3 million will allow for the provision of additional services in 1998.  In addition the board is also currently considering the funding which will be required to provide services on top of those being funded from this £2.3 million.  The board will be in discussion with my Department about the resources which will be necessary to meet this following their consideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>Personal assistance services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development, <i>inter alia</i>, of personal assistance services.  On foot of the report, an additional £3.688 million was provided last year for these services, of which £226,000 was allocated to personal assistance services.  A further £3 million has been allocated this year for the development of the services.  Priorities for the allocation of this funding will be decided by health boards in consultation with the co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.  Personal assistance services is one of the priority areas to be considered as part of this process.</P>
      <P>An advisory group on personal assistance services set up by one of my predecessors explored the option of establishing an independent living fund as a means of funding personal assistance services for people with disabilities but considered that it would be too cumbersome to administer.</P>

    <P>The concluding observations of the committee were received by the Department of Foreign Affairs on Friday last, 23 January, and forwarded that afternoon to my Department.  However, the official record of the committee's hearing has not yet been received.  When this record is to hand, I will write to the Deputy with a detailed response to his queries.  The Deputy will appreciate that other Departments will also be involved <Col N="734" /> in implementing commitments under the convention.</P>
    <P>The principal commitments made at the recent hearings of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on behalf of the Government in so far as the responsibilities of this Department are concerned were clarification of my responsibilities in relation to child care issues and this issue is being addressed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently been appointed as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When the details of the delegation of functions in regard to these two Departments have been finalised, I will be assisted in my new responsibilities by a cross-departmental team.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was indicated to the committee that a social services inspectorate would be established and this is my top priority for 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 48, 68 and 152 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I am committed to establishing a tribunal of inquiry into HIV and hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products.  I reject the suggestion that there has been any unreasonable delay in progressing this matter.  Over the last few months, I have devoted a great deal of time and attention to matters relating to the blood supply and blood safety.  Among the measures that I have set in place are: (i) approval of arrangements for the supply of recombinant Factor VIII from early this year and for the supply of recombinant Factor IX when it becomes commercially available in the interests of enhanced safety for people with haemophilia; (ii) establishment of the hepatitis C compensation tribunal on a statutory basis and the establishment of the reparation fund to allow claimants to obtain an additional 20 per cent of their award in lieu of the tribunal assessing aggravated and exemplary damages; (iii) settlement arrangements to give claimants to the hepatitis C compensation tribunal the option of settling their claims without having to make a personal appearance before the tribunal; (iv) introducing arrangements for the making of payments from the reparation fund in respect of persons who have died since accepting an award of general and/or special damages from the compensation tribunal; and (v) initiating a major review of the primary and secondary <Col N="736" /> health care services for persons with hepatitis C to ensure that the services are effectively meeting the needs of those affected.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society in the autumn, I gave an assurance that the society would be consulted in relation to the preparation of terms of reference for the next tribunal.  Discussions have been taking place between representatives of the society and officials of my Department with a view to clarifying in detail the matters that the society wishes to have investigated.</P>
    <P>A number of legal and other matters need to be resolved before the terms of reference for the next tribunal can be finalised and submitted to the Government for approval.  At this stage, it would appear that the next tribunal will inquire into events as far back as 1973 which are relevant to the infection of persons with haemophilia with HIV or hepatitis C, will address complex issues about the selection, manufacture and application of clotting factor concentrates imported for use in Irish hospitals or manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The tribunal will also address the circumstances of the HIV infection of the Kilkenny health worker who contracted HIV from a blood component in 1985 prior to the introduction of HIV screening.  My Department is corresponding with the solicitors involved in relation to the matters arising from this case which should be investigated by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>As soon as the various issues have been agreed with the relevant parties, my Department will request the Attorney General's Office to prepare terms of reference.  On approval by Government, I will bring the terms of reference to the Dáil and Seanad by way of motion to establish the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the tribunal will be established in April, will commence public hearings in June and will report in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health service employment has grown significantly since 1990.  For example, between 1990 and 1996 the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in the public health service funded directly by my Department increased from 24,732 to 27,264 &mdash; an increase of 2,532 or 10.2 per cent.  However, a number of boards have traditionally had difficulties in recruitment of certain grades of staff, which may vary from place to <Col N="737" /> place.  In the current economic climate, opportunities in the private sector can result in high levels of competition for some grades of professional staff.</P>
      <P>In relation to future manpower needs of the sector and particularly recruitment and retention rates, there are a number of current initiatives. For example, as the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on Nursing chaired by Ms Justice Mella Carroll, which recently published its interim report, is looking at these matters and will issue its recommendations in its final report. Issues relating to the availability of nurses will be viewed in light of that report.</P>
      <P>In the cases of the paramedic grades, the Deputy will be aware that, in April 1997, the Labour Court issued its findings on a pay claim made by nine paramedical professions including social workers, occupational therapists, and speech and langauge therapists.  The court also recommended the setting up of an expert group to examine and report on several issues including those of recruitment, retention, training and education requirements for each of the professions.  This expert group has recently been set up and will report on its findings in due course.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy will be also be aware that the training of additional health service grades, in many cases, requires the making available of an increased number of third level university places and this is a matter in the first instance for the Higher Education Authority.  The recommendations of the reviews which I have mentioned will be brought to the authority's attention.</P>

      <P>The General Medical Services &mdash; GMS &mdash; scheme provides a treatment and curative service for eligible persons, i.e., medical card holders.  The position is that cervical smear testing is available under the GMS scheme where it is required in the context of an individual patient's medical examination.  However, cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the GMS as a screening service for medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee recommended a national cervical screening programme for women aged 25-60 years at five year intervals.  This programme will first be piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board to identify and resolve any difficulties which may become apparent.  Cervical screening will be provided free of charge to women involved in the pilot scheme and to all women on <Col N="738" /> the introduction of the national screening programme. However, pending the introduction of the national programme, the question of providing cervical screening as part of GMS scheme for women with medical cards in the relevant age category is currently under consideration within the Department.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 21 June 1998 has been set by the board of the new hospital as being the opening date for services at Tallaght.  The people of Tallaght and the hospital's catchment population have been patient in their wait for this fine facility and I do not expect that they will be asked to wait beyond 21 June.</P>
      <P>I am assured that by 21 June the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital will have moved to Tallaght and, with the exception of 76 beds for specific programmes, the Meath Hospital will also have moved to Tallaght by that date.  It is intended that the acute psychiatric facilities currently provided at St. Loman's Hospital will transfer to the new hospital at Tallaght before 21 June.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that last year the Department agreed to the hospital's proposals to develop private and semi-private facilities on site providing up to 77 additional beds.  The development of these facilities is a matter for the board of the hospital which will own and manage them as an integral element of the total hospital.  It is understood that these beds will not be available until next year.  It is for this reason that the 76 beds which I mentioned above will be retained at the Meath Hospital.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the complexity of the exercise of transferring the services, patients and staff from the base hospitals, I have had repeated assurances from the hospital that progress towards the opening date is satisfactory and on course.  I do not anticipate any delay beyond June 21.  The hospital's decision to open on 21 June has been and will continue to be fully supported by the Department together with the staff of the base hospitals and the trade unions, the Eastern Health Board and other hospitals such as St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, enables any dependant to make a claim for compensation to the tribunal where a person dies as a result of having contracted hepatitis C or where hepatitis C was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) of the Act provides that an award of the tribunal to a claimant shall be made on the same basis as an award of the High Court calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort and any relevant statutory provisions, including Part IV of the Civil Liability Act.  In accordance with this provision, where a claimant dies before his or her case for damages is determined, the amounts recoverable by a dependant may not include damages for any pain or suffering or personal injury or for loss or diminution of expectation of life or happiness, as these matters are uniquely connected with the deceased.</P>
      <P>Under section 11 of the Act, any claimant who has already accepted an award from the Tribunal may apply for a payment for an additional 20 per cent from the reparation fund in lieu of the tribunal assessing aggravated or exemplary damages. In recent months I received a number of submissions from the representative groups in relation to claimants who died after accepting an award of the tribunal, but before the establishment of the reparation fund.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45, 80 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House last year I am adopting a broad approach to the issue of improving the reporting of child abuse.  The mandatory reporting of child abuse is a commitment in the programme for the millennium which will be introduced in the life of the Government.  I regard it as essential that this be done in a way which will have wide support from the professions who will have to comply with the requirement and which will produce a reporting scheme that is effective, efficient and sensitive to the needs of children in this country.  I also consider that considerable additional investment in our child care services will be required in advance of the introduction of mandatory reporting.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my intention of continuing to progress the initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting of child abuse as outlined in Putting Children First &mdash; Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Children.  At present I am in the process of establishing a working group to review the 1987 and 1995 child abuse guidelines. I consider this to be a crucial first step in creating an environment which will help to facilitate the reporting of child abuse.  We have seen enormous changes in regard to the level of awareness of child abuse in the last ten years and a considerable expansion of services to protect vulnerable children.  Our knowledge of this complex area has increased and the time is now opportune to review these guidelines.</P>
      <P>The working group will have an independent chairperson and will include representatives of the following agencies: Department of Health and Children; Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Department of Education and Science; Health boards; Garda Síochána; Children's Rights Alliance/voluntary sector; Irish College of General Practitioners; Irish Association of Social Workers; Resident Managers Association; Impact; and the INTO.</P>
      <P>I will be announcing the membership of the group and its terms of reference next week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 49 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board recorded a total of 1,061 new cases of prostate cancer in 1994 and 1,084 in 1995, the latest year for which complete information is available.  It is difficult to estimate the true incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of prostate cancer because of the nature of the disease.</P>
      <P>Many prostate cancers are not fatal and do not cause symptoms during the patient's lifetime.  In these circumstances the cancer is only identified incidentally when the patient has surgery for benign prostatic disease.  As the number of men having surgery for benign disease increases, so too will the detection of prostate cancer.  This gives rise to an increase in the number of prostate cancers detected but does not necessarily mean that the true incidence of prostate cancer is increasing.</P>
      <P>While there has been an upward trend in deaths from prostate cancer, this may be due to more comprehensive diagnosis and investigation, together with increased longevity among men in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board has funded research into prostate cancer, including therapeutic research, in recent years.  Funding of £80,000 has been provided to the Health Research Board under the national cancer strategy for a separate programme of clinical research into all forms of cancer, with particular emphasis on multi-institutional and multi-discriplinary research.  The Health Research Board is currently evaluating applications in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to mass screening programmes for prostate cancer and bowel cancer, I am keeping <Col N="743" /> the medical evidence regarding their effectiveness under review.  While advances are continually being made in the detection and treatment of these diseases, the expert advice available to me is that effective techniques have yet to be developed which would make the introduction of mass screening programmes possible.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy stresses the importance of adequate advice and support for patients who have been diagnosed as having any form of cancer.  While the term &lsquo;counselling&rsquo; may have a number of different meanings, ranging from general advice to formal counselling sessions, the philosophy underlying the strategy is that patients and their families should have adequate and clear information about the nature of their disease, the treatments available for it and any other details that they wish to have explained.  The services provided by hospitals to patients with cancer are currently the focus of attention by the regional directors of cancer services, who are drawing up cancer plans for their regions at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 79, 84, 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to bring forward a Bill setting up the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to honour the committment given in the Action Programme for the Millennium.  The authority will be independent and science-based and will take over the functions relating to food safety currently discharged by other State agencies and Departments.  I outlined the proposed content of the Bill to the Government before the end of last year and it is my intention to introduce it to the Oireachtas during the current session.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for food safety is currently divided amongst several Departments and agencies and is carried out by a wide range of disciplines. Clearly, detailed consultation with the representatives concerned will be required before transfers to the new body can be effected.  An interdepartmental committee has been established to co-ordinate the transfer of the relevant functions to the SFAI and this committee has already met on a number of occasions.  In the meantime, in order to ensure continuity of the best possible service to the consumer, it is anticipated that the FSAI will discharge its functions in the first instance by way of contractual arrangements with existing agencies.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the rapid exchange of information on food alerts and I am satisfied that the systems currently in place work well.  The question of the transfer of this function to the FSAI is one which may be considered in the longer term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>My Department collects information on children in care by means of an annual census.  The latest data for which information is available is 31 December 1996.  Details in this regard are set out in the following table.  Figures for 1997 are being collated by the health boards at present and are not yet available.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of assessments, I would point out that health boards provide a range of child care and family support services in accordance with their statutory obligation to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  An intervention by a health board with a child occurs within the context of a structured care planning process which includes assessment of the needs of the child, the family situation and child protection issues.</P>
      <P>When as part of this process, a health board decides that a child cannot, for one reason or another, remain in his or her family, the board will make alternative arrangements for his or her care.  This usually takes the form of foster or residential care.  As such a decision occurs as part of a care plan, the question of a waiting list for such health board assessments does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occasionally, situations can arise where a child is admitted to care on an emergency basis prior to assessment.  When a child is admitted to foster care in this manner the assessment process followed is that which is laid down in The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 which states that the health <Col N="747" /> board should carry out an assessment of the child's circumstances as soon as possible.  When a child is admitted to residential care in this manner, an assessment is an integral part of the service provided.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, he has had with the Department of Justice in relation to concerns about inadequate drug treatment services in prisons and the lack of continuity for those prisoners who were on treatment programmes prior to entering prison; and the proposals, if any, for addressing this major gap in drug treatment services.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services for drug misusers in prison is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the first instance.  At present the Eastern Health Board's consultant psychiatrists with responsibility for drug misuse provide sessions in Mountjoy prison. These consultants have been in discussion with officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including the director of prison medical services and the governor of Mountjoy prison, with a view to extending and improving the drug treatment services provided to prisoners including, where appropriate, methadone maintenance.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that concrete developments in this regard have been hampered by ongoing overcrowding in the prison.  A special treatment programme is provided to prisoners who are HIV positive or who have AIDS.  A drug-free unit was also introduced into the prison in June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second ministerial task force report on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, which was published in May 1997 recommended the establishment of an independent expert group &mdash; containing international expertise &mdash; to assess how treatment services inside and outside prison interact and to make recommendations for the improved co-ordination/integration of those services for drug misusers coming into contact with the criminal justice system.  The membership and <Col N="748" /> terms of reference of this group are being considered by the interdepartmental policy group on drugs and the group will shortly report on the matter to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Mater Hospital that hearts offered for transplantation may be rejected for one or more of the following reasons: The hospital may not have a suitable recipient of the correct blood group or the donor and recipient may not match.  There are generally accepted age limits for heart donors &mdash; 40 years in the case of males and 45 years for females.  In addition a discrepancy of 20 per cent between the weight of the donor and the recipient would generally rule the heart out of consideration.  Heart transplantation differs from lung and kidney transplantation in that the donated organs must be used within four hours of explantation whereas with the kidney or liver 12 to 24 hours may be adequate.  It has happened on occasions that transport difficulties have arisen which has rendered it necessary to turn down an organ donation.</P>
      <P>I am informed that on occasions the intensive care unit and cubicles may be full and there may be no beds to accept proper donation.  On one occasion last year the cardiac transplant unit was closed for routine maintenance work and the hospital went off call.  During that time three hearts were offered, one of which was used in the UK and two of which were deemed to be medically unsuitable.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures announced by me today as part of the strategy on cardiovascular health will lead to an enhancement of cardiac care facilities nationally, including the transplantation programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 87, 130 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, the Eastern Health Board developed a refugee medical centre as an integral part of the refugee unit on the campus of St. James's Hospital.  The centre provides screening for refugees-asylum seekers presenting at the centre of both tuberculosis and hepatitis B and updating immunisations where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has special arrangements with six local general practitioners who provide interim medical services for refugees/ asylum seekers on arrival until such time as they are provided with a medical card and a choice of doctor and chemist.  Special payment arrangements are made with the six doctors concerned and in fact one of the doctors utilises facilities in the refugee medical centre which the Eastern Health Board fully supports.  Staff in the screening service work very closely with the general practitioners.</P>
      <P>On the provision of a centre to provide specifically for the needs of refugee victims of torture, I understand there are differing views among specialists in this field on the need for the establishment of such a centre.  However, there is agreement on the need to develop a psychological/ counselling service for refugees which would be associated with the health screening service outlined above with referral to the mental health services where appropriate.  In this connection, I have made additional resources available to the Eastern Health Board this year to enable such a service to be established.</P>

      <P>At present there are no hard data on the number of heroin addicts in Dublin.  In order to address this issue, the Eastern Health Board commissioned a research study in 1997 into drug misuse in Dublin.  This is a capture-recapture study to estimate the prevalence of opiate misuse in the Dublin area.  The study is being carried out by Dr. Catherine Comiskey, at the department of applied science, Regional Technical College, Tallaght and the results of this study will be published in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The study will give prevalence figures for drug users in the Dublin area, including those not currently on waiting lists and will provide information to the health board on the number of persons in each community care area who are misusing drugs. This information will be useful to the health board and other agencies providing services to prevent and treat drug misuse, in providing adequate resources to address the drug misuse problem in the respective areas of this city.</P>

There are, therefore, at present sufficient blood stocks available at hospitals and the Blood Transfusion Service Board to meet hospital requirements.</P>
      <P>Over the Christmas period the BTSB experienced difficulty in securing adequate supplies of blood, particularly O negative.  In response, a major national appeal for donors was launched by the BTSB in an effort to improve blood stock levels.  Additional donor clinics were also provided to facilitate donors.  These measures were successful and between 8 and 23 January the total number of donations was 9,433, including 2,810 rhesus negative units.

    <P>There were 33 deaths from bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, reported in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> As part of my Department's response to the rise in the number of cases of meningitis in recent years, the working group on bacterial meningitis was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of the deputy chief medical officer of the Department of Health.  Its remit was &ldquo;to examine the incidence of bacterial meningitis and related conditions, and to make such recommendations as may be required to strengthen the surveillance and control of these conditions.&rdquo; The working group produced its report in January 1997 and made detailed recommendations relating to improved procedures for the diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of meningitis.  These are being implemented by the health boards and other agencies concerned.  The working group has continued in existence to monitor the situation and to provide advice on the surveillance and control of meningitis as required.  I have asked the working group to meet again shortly to consider whether there are any further measures or procedures required in the light of recent experience.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken a number of steps to raise awareness of meningitis.  The health promotion unit has produced a revised leaflet for the information of the public generally and a leaflet for general practitioners.  The health promotion unit also made arrangements recently for public information on meningitis to be carried on the RTÉ Aertel teletext service.  In November 1997 an updated press facts document was issued by my Department to the national media.  My Department has also provided financial assistance to the Meningitis Research Foundation to enable an information and education officer to be employed for a three year period.  The foundation carries out valuable work in ensuring a high level of public awareness about meningitis and there is co-operation between the health boards and the foundation in relation to public talks and local awareness campaigns.</P>
    <P>In November 1997 the chief medical officer of my Department wrote on my behalf to the director of public health in each health board, requesting that they take all necessary measures to ensure the highest possible awareness in relation to bacterial meningitis, principally meningococcal meningitis, among professionals, parents and the public generally.  The directors were asked to circulate the updated press facts document to the provincial media.</P>

      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment and diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years.</P>
      <P>A minority of persons with autism do require specialised facilities.  Additional specific services for persons with autism have been provided in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which now provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's policy document on services for persons with autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental hndicap and autism in their regions.  Additional funding amounting to £225,000 in 1994, £300,000 in 1995 and £500,000 in 1997 was made available for the development of services specifically for persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 for services for persons with a mental handicap and autism.  This includes £7 million which was announced in the budget for the development of new residential, respite and day care places and £3.75 million in the Estimates to meet identified needs in existing services.  Capital funding of £5.25 million is also being provided in 1998 to begin the implementation of a £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in An Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residential and day services for persons with a mental handicap, <Col N="755" /> including those with autism, over the period concerned.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the ongoing development of these services as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the severe distress that can be caused for those who lose their medical cards or whose applications are rejected as being marginally over the financial eligibility limits; and his views on the merit of introducing medical cards giving partial or limited entitlements to people in this category.</Quest>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The number of eligibility categories for entitlement to health services was reduced from three to two as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991.  This followed the detailed analysis of the eligibility system by the Commission on Health Funding and its recommendation of measures to simplify the system and make it more equitable.  In particular, the commission found that there were major problems and inequities inherent in allocating non-medical card holders to more than one eligibility category on income grounds.  These problems were removed when the new eligibility system came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A system of partial or limited entitlement for non-medical card holders would presumably have to be based on income and would thus reintroduce these problems.  In addition, it would make the system far more complex than at present and could greatly increase administrative costs because of the increased number of persons to be means tested.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable <Col N="756" /> to provide these services for themselves and their dependants without hardship.</P>

    <P>Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993, it has focused upon those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times have caused the greatest difficulty.  These areas include cardiac surgery, ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the numbers waiting for treatment in public hospitals, including the specialties mentioned by the Deputy.  With this in mind, I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998.  This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  It represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding made available last year for waiting list work.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have reviewed the arrangements for application of waiting list funding and I have recently taken the following initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the system:</P>
    <P>Where applicable, agencies have been notified in their determination of net expenditure <Col N="757" /> for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.</P>
    <P>Each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action, if necessary, as the year proceeds.</P>
    <P>Agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention.</P>
    <P>Where agencies have not already done so, they have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>
    <P>I am confident that taken together these measures offer the best means of reducing both waiting lists and waiting times.  This will be to the benefit of all patients, particularly medical card holders, who depend on the services provided in public hospitals.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board is the primary vehicle for conducting health research in Ireland. It is not currently engaged in funding any research in this area.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the National Rehabilitation Board published the Report of Epidemiology of Childhood Hearing Impairment in South-East Ireland.  The report states that 8 per cent of the 6,000 children surveyed required audiology assessment, half of whom had significant hearing problems.</P>
      <P>My Department does have access to international studies in the area of hearing loss.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards provide a speech and language therapy service to the community, including school-children.  Sometimes, where numbers justify it, a health board will provide a speech and language therapy class in a particular school. However, the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which was published in October 1993, recommended that speech therapists working full-time in schools should be funded by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Speech and language therapy services in all areas are in need of development.  Health boards regard this as a priority and 31 additional posts of speech and language therapist have been created in the boards in the last four years.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities are being put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for the development of these services in 1998.  The question of allocating funds for the provision of additional speech and language therapist posts will be considered by each health board in consultation with the local co-ordinating committee.</P>
      <P>The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998 will be £8.4 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.</P>

      <P>There is no on-going routine testing of pregnant women for HIV.  However, women wishing to have a HIV test are appropriately counselled and tested and results furnished to them.</P>
      <P>A programme of anonymous unlinked testing for HIV, as recommended by the surveillance sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, has been carried out in maternity hospitals and units throughout the country since 1992.  Results for the four year period from 1992 to 1996 show that of the total of 222,687 tests which were carried out, 37 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.017 per cent or one in 6,019.</P>
      <P>Because of the recent advancements in the effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and the resulting improvement in health outcomes for both mothers and babies, the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its subcommittees have been examining the issue of routine ante-natal testing for HIV in pregnant women.  This will be progressed further at the next meeting of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, which will take place in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Regarding hepatitis C, I am informed that apart from those who contracted hepatitis C through infected blood or blood products and apart from intravenous drug misusers among whom there is a high incidence of the disease and who are tested for the virus in drug treatment clinics, there is no evidence to suggest that the prevalence of hepatitis C in this country is any higher than in other comparable countries.</P>
    <P>As with HIV, any pregnant woman who requests a test for hepatitis C is tested and furnished with the results of this test.  To conduct a national programme of ante-natal screening for hepatitis C would be of little benefit as there is no constructive intervention which can be used, such as vaccination, and there exists no satisfactory cure for hepatitis C. Accordingly, there are no proposals at present to test pregnant women for hepatitis C. My Department is, however, examining a proposal to undertake a pilot project involving the screening of expectant mothers for hepatitis B and C. The outcome of such a study would give useful information on the prevalence of these viruses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland on 21 October 1997 to discuss the association's pre-budget submission on service requirements for 1998.  I outlined to the association at that time my plans for 1998, which were subsequently delivered in the budget and Estimates for 1998, and in my Department's capital programme for 1998 to 2001.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 for services for persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £7 million which was included in the budget for the development of new residential, respite and day care places and £3.75 million in the Estimates to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capacity of existing facilities to absorb the additional places in the coming years and to provide the specialist services for disturbed clients is now limited.  A programme of building is essential to deliver the volume and quality of services required.  Capital funding of £5.25 million is also being provided in 1998 to begin the implementation of a £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in <Col N="762" /> An Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this funding will make a significant impact to reduce the number of people with a mental handicap who are awaiting day, residential or respite services.  The Government is committed to the ongoing development of these services as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the complaints by the public that the lack of oral hygiene is being used as an excuse not to treat patients in relation to orthodontic treatment provided by the health boards; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that some patients, during their time on the waiting lists, have experienced serious gum infections in view of the fact that they have been unable to clean their teeth due to overcrowding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment on both medical needs criteria and on dental fitness in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department for the provision of secondary care orthodontic treatment and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/handicap.</P>
      <P>In relation to the dental health status of the patient, the guidelines state that &ldquo;patients should be free from untreated dental caries with all lesions satisfactorily restored and they should be free from active gingivitis and/or peridontitis&rdquo;. The guidelines also provide that prior to commencing appliance therapy all patients and parents should be assessed to ensure their understanding of the need to comply with the instructions of the orthodontist and to co-operate fully in preventive measures for the entire period of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that there is great disappointment should a patient be refused orthodontic treatment due to a low level of oral hygiene when treatment is due to be carried out.  Accordingly, my Department has advised health boards that patients on waiting lists and their parents should be routinely circulated with a standard letter advising them of the necessity to maintain their oral health to the highest possible standard while awaiting treatment and highlighting the possibility of the refusal of treatment if oral hygiene is not of the highest standard and the reasons the highest standards of oral hygiene are required before orthodontic treatment is commenced.  Teeth overcrowding <Col N="763" /> is not an obstacle to maintaining a high standard of oral hygiene.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that these guidelines are being misused by health boards as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that fluoride, as it occurs normally in nature in this country or in its use as a public health measure to improve oral health, has any adverse effect on human enzyme systems.  A paper presented at a World Scientific Congress in October 1997 reported that there was no adverse effect on human enzyme systems in a population living in an area with naturally fluoridated water at four times the optimal level.</P>
      <P>World health authorities agreed that lead emissions in the environment can be a hazard to human health and that fluoride used as a public health measure is safe for human health.</P>
      <P>Metabolism of fluoride involves the absorption of approximately 75 per cent to 90 per cent from the alimentary tract.  Approximately 50 per cent of the dose absorbed is excreted in urine and the rest is associated with calcified tissues in teeth and bone.  The lifetime accumulation of fluoride ion in bone over several generations in communities with naturally fluoridated water in the United States has had no adverse health consequences.</P>

    <P>CSO estimates</P>
    <P>I am very encouraged by these CSO estimates which show an 18 per cent increase in total North-South trade in 1997 compared to 1996.  At this rate, North-South trade will be worth more than £1.6 billion for the whole of last year &mdash; up more than 50 per cent in the past five years.  There are now more than 2,000 companies, North and <Col N="765" /> South, with commercial contacts.  In recent years in particular, the business community, North and South, has provided strong and courageous leadership in pointing to the economic price of conflict and instability and in urging a generous and pragmatic approach to reconciliation and comprehensive talks.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I remain fully committed to ensuring that cross-Border co-operation on economic matters is fully developed in the lifetime of this Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, will shortly visit his counterpart in Northern Ireland to discuss ideas on further enhancing cross-Border trade. Deputy Kitt will also be involved in An Bord Tráchtála's trade promotion programme as part of their Ireland market strategy and officials of my Department will be fully engaged in the policy issues related to increasing cross-Border trade and investment.</P>
    <P>The nature, role and functions of North-South structures are matters currently under discussion within the talks process and it would not be appropriate to comment on them in detail at this time.  I have no doubt, however, that any new structures emerging as part of a comprehensive settlement would facilitate increased North-South trade.  Furthermore, the putting in place of an agreement across the three strands, and the resulting consolidation of peace on the island, would in themselves generate an impetus for increased commercial and economic activity.  I consider that this peace dividend could itself in turn be a guarantor of the sustainable peace which is the common objective of all parties engaged in the talks process.</P>
    <P>A total of £104 million was provided by the Exchequer to An Bord Tráchtála for the marketing of Irish goods and services in the three year period 1995-97.  It is a matter for the board of An Bord Tráchtála, in accordance with section 6(1) of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991, to determine, within the overall grant allocation, expenditure in individual markets, including any expenditure on the development of cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>While the Ballinacarra, Kilmaine, area is situated in the Corrib-Headford river catchment area it was not included in the Corrib-Headford catchment drainage scheme carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, between 1967 and 1973 as the cost would not be justified on economic grounds.  The commissioners' responsibilities for this scheme are now confined by statute to the maintenance of the scheduled works.</P>
      <P>In July 1990 the Office of Public Works was commissioned by Mayo County Council to undertake an investigation of the flooding problem at Ballinacarra, Kilmaine, and to suggest to the council what remedial action should be taken to relieve the flooding.  The commissioners subsequently undertook a detailed survey of the area and a report and design of a scheme were forwarded to the council in December 1990.  This report indicated that the Commissioners of Public Works were prepared to complete the works on behalf of Mayo County Council on an agency basis.  Nothing further has been heard since from the council in the matter.</P>
      <P>It would not be the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works to make grants available to local authorities for drainage works.

      <P>Business taxation reliefs introduced and extended over recent years have been primarily targeted at small to medium-sized privately and often family owned trading companies, including businesses <Col N="770" /> carried on in the exercise of a trade or profession. These reliefs are designed to recognise the endeavours of those who have built up small to medium-sized enterprises, to encourage the future development of the small business sector and to counter liquidity problems that arise on transfer.</P>
      <P>Those reliefs specifically targeted at reducing the burden of taxation on the transfer of businesses include capital acquisitions tax business relief and capital gains tax retirement relief.</P>
      <P>Capital acquisitions tax business relief allows the taxable value of business assets to be reduced by 90 per cent in assessing inheritance and gift tax liabilities.  The relief is available for property consisting of a business or an interest in a business and is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses.  The rationale for its introduction in 1994 and improvement over the subsequent years was to facilitate the transfer of family owned businesses to the next generation. Under the provisions of this relief, each child can receive, by gift or inheritance, business assets up to the value of IR£1,855,500 from his/her parents free of capital acquisitions tax, or a family business worth over £5,566,500 can be divided among three children on inheritance without a capital acquisitions tax liability.</P>
      <P>Capital gains tax retirement relief is available to persons over 55 years of age on the disposal of business assets, including shares in family companies, and amounts to a whole or partial exemption from capital gains tax.  This is an important relief in so far as the lifetime transfer of a family business is concerned, where the potential capital gains tax liability might otherwise be substantial. The relief is restricted to aggregate disposals of up to £250,000 where the transferee is not a child of the transferor with partial relief for disposal above that amount.  However, there is no such limit in the case of disposals to a child.  No capital gains tax arises on assets transferred by inheritance. This relief complements the capital acquisitions tax business relief on transfers which reduces or eliminates tax payable by the recipient.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the European Commission made recommendations in respect of the transfer of small and medium-sized enterprises, with the aim of combating business failures due to inadequate preparation or organisation of the transfer.  Last year, as part of its evaluation of progress achieved in implementing these recommendations, the Commission produced a table summarising the environment for transfers of business in each of the member states.  Of the 15 member states, Ireland and the UK are the only countries which provide for a 100 per cent capital gains tax exemption for transfers of businesses within a family.  Ireland is only one of five member states that provides measures facilitating the transfer of businesses to a third party and is one of only three that provides roll-over relief for businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I remind the Deputy that it is the responsibility of business owners to make themselves <Col N="771" /> aware of the legislative environment in which they operate and to plan for the future. Both of these reliefs ease significantly the transfer of businesses to the next generation and in the circumstances I do not propose to introduce any further measures.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in reducing the rate of unemployment in Ireland in recent years.  With a present rate of about 10 per cent, we are below the EU average rate and very substantially below the rate of some 15 per cent that obtained here as recently as 1993.</P>
      <P>However, the present rate of about 10 per cent is still unacceptably high.  The Government is determined to continue with those policies that are effective, and to introduce new policies, as necessary, to bring the rate down further as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>A principal thrust of policy will be to address the main structural problem, that of long-term unemployment.  Persons unemployed for over one year comprise over half of the total unemployed.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are already a number of major schemes focused on encouraging the long-term unemployed back to work, most notably the community employment and the back to work allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>In my recent budget, I announced a further two part initiative for the long-term unemployed, to operate from 6 April this year.  The first part is a special tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period.</P>
      <P>The second part of the initiative is a double tax deduction for wages for employers who employ a long-term unemployed person.  This double deduction can last for a period of up to three years provided the former long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.  Participants in this initiative will retain their secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>As regards the future, my Government colleagues and I are determined to ensure that the long-term unemployed will continue to be a focus of policy.  We will be reviewing on a continuing basis what further measures might be most effective in encouraging the long-term unemployed to take up the jobs that are becoming increasingly available in our country as a result of our strong economic growth.</P>

      <P>The question at issue as far as my Department was concerned was the upgrading of a senior post in the revenue solicitor's office concerned with prosecutions for tax fraud.  The Revenue Commissioners do not maintain that the prosecution process had been hampered because there were not enough solicitors in the office.  The solution agreed involved the upgrading sought and the redeployment into the office of an extra post within Revenue's staff ceiling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or subcontractors.</P>
      <P>The C45 system, known as relevant contracts tax applies only to payments to self-employed subcontractors.  Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.  It would be imprudent to consider abolishing the system, which serves a useful purpose in ensuring tax compliance in the industries to which it refers i.e. construction, forestry and meat processing.</P>
      <P>In this context Revenue has issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a subcontractor.  Principal contractors and subcontractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
      <P>When the C45 system is applied incorrectly to payment of wages to employees, the employer remains liable for the PAYE/PRSI and levies which should have been deducted from the employee's wages and for the employer's PRSI contribution.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently engaged in a special project aimed at detecting cases in which the C45 system is being used incorrectly in relation to payments to employees.  Where an employment is considered to exist and PAYE/PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal is being advised to put matters on a proper footing.  When this is not done, the principal will become liable for the PAYE/PRSI and levies.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regularly conduct joint investigations under the joint investigation programme to ensure that those engaged as employees fully comply with the tax system and to ensure that employers are not facilitating &ldquo;working and signing&rdquo; arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood the the UK Inland Revenue undertook a similar operation some time ago. However, no part of the C45 system as it operates in the UK is being abolished but the system is being confined to the type of payments to which it correctly refers i.e. payments to self-employed <Col N="774" /> subcontractors.  Legislative changes in the UK Finance Act, 1995, which have not yet come into effect, restrict the categories of subcontractors who will be able to receive payments without having tax deducted from the payment.  Self-employed subcontractors who no longer qualify for an exemption certificate, equivalent to the C2 in this country, will receive payments subject to deduction of tax, i.e. C45 type tax.  There is no indication on the part of the UK authorities that they intend to apply PAYE to self-employed subcontractors in the construction industry in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax evasion involving offshore tax havens is a worldwide problem.  The liberalisation and globalisation of capital movements, the increase in the number of tax havens &mdash; there are now more than 40 &mdash; and the development of electronic commerce and sophisticated communications technology means that funds can be transferred to a wide range of offshore financial institutions at the stroke of a keyboard.  By definition, the extent of the problem is impossible to determine.  Efforts are being made at OECD and EU level to adopt a collective approach towards tackling this problem &mdash; unilateral action by any one country, while it may make it more difficult for its residents to use offshore havens, is unlikely to be wholly effective and, depending on the action taken, may have serious adverse effects for the economy or financial system of the country concerned.</P>
      <P>The difficulties faced by the Revenue Commissioners in seeking to deal with offshore tax fraud by Irish residents must be looked at in this context.  Revenue's jurisdiction does not extend to places such as the Cayman Islands or the Isle of Man and these havens will not enter into tax treaties which provide for exchange of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Moriarty Tribunal is required by its terms of reference to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary or expedient &ldquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax laws should be made to achieve this end&rdquo;.  Following the publication of the McCracken report I also asked the officials in my Department and the Revenue Commissioners to review existing powers and to come back to me with proposals if they considered that existing powers needed to be augmented.  If any <Col N="775" /> additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, then appropriate proposals will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Central Bank, the House is already aware that I had asked the Governor to advise me if the board of the Central Bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I placed the contents of the Governor's reply on the record of the House when responding to a parliamentary question from Deputy Rabbitte on 19 November 1997. In that letter, the Governor confirmed that the board is satisfied with its legal powers; that the board keeps under review the bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision; that the board endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.  He also confirmed that the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the bank.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and the financial services sector generally. I await the tribunal's report on this matter and will, of course, give careful consideration to any recommendation it might make in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the Central Bank is subject to a very strict confidentiality regime, provision is made for the disclosure of information as required by a court in connection with criminal proceedings.  In addition, the bank, under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, may disclose to the Garda, where it has reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.  Further, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the Garda a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering or certain related offences; money laundering embraces tax evasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>There has been no delay in publishing details of arrangements for this year's intake of student nurses to the nursing registration/diploma programmes. The 1996 and 1997 competitions for places on the programmes were advertised in the months of March and April respectively.  This year the competitions for the general nursing and psychiatric programmes will be advertised on 19 February.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week I announced details of the application and selection process for this year's competitions in order to give students and their parents, guidance counsellors, schools of nursing, third level institutions and other interested parties advance notice of the arrangements.  I have also arranged for batches of application forms and information booklets to be sent to school guidance counsellors before the advertisement for the competitions is published.  In addition, the various schools of nursing have been asked to nominate contact persons who will be available to liaise with schools in relation to student nurse recruitment and to assist in the organisation of career talks for students.  These initiatives are designed to stimulate interest among school leavers in nursing as a career and to make them aware of the procedures for entry to training.</P>
      <P>The application and selection processes for both the general nursing and psychiatric nursing programmes will be administered by the Local Appointments Commission on behalf of the Nursing Applications Centre.  Applicants for these two programmes will undergo a written assessment test of two to three hours duration on 27 or 30 June 1998.  Those placed highest will be called for interview.  The interviews will be held during the final week of July and the first two weeks of August 1998.  The first round of offers of places to successful applicants will be issued within one week of the publication of the results of the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application and selection process for places on the 1998 mental handicap nursing registration/diploma programme will be handled by the Mental Handicap Nursing Applications Centre.  This centre has been in existence since 1991 and operates under the auspices of the Federation of Voluntary Bodies providing Services <Col N="777" /> for People with a Mental Handicap.  This particular competition will be advertised on 19 April 1998.  The detailed arrangements will be publicised in advance of that date.</P>
    <P>I presume Deputy Gilmore is referring to the one year full-time degree course which University College Galway is offering to students who have successfully completed the first general nursing registration/diploma programme which was introduced in 1994.</P>
    <P>The position is that successful completion by a student of the three year nursing registration/diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she becomes eligible for employment as a nurse.  Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees.  I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses nor have I any function in relation to abolition of, or exemptions from, the fees charged by third level institutions in respect of them.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing in its interim report has identified a number of issues relating to pre-registration nursing education and training, which it is expected to address in its final report.  I consider that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the deliberations of the commission before contemplating any changes in the present arrangements, which are in compliance with the rules of An Bord Altranais and the relevant EU Directives.</P>

      <P>The new hospital at Tallaght will be a major acute hospital serving Tallaght, Clondalkin, Firhouse, Rathfarnham, Terenure, Templeogue, west Wicklow and south Kildare with a catchment population of approximately 250,000.</P>
      <P>The services currently provided at the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital are being transferred to this new hospital together with acute psychiatric services transferring from St. Loman's Hospital.</P>
      <P>Maternity services in Dublin are provided by the Coombe Women's Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the initiative of my Department the three Dublin maternity hospitals established a strategic review group in 1996.  The group, with the assistance <Col N="778" /> of an external consultant, has recently completed its strategic review which looks, <i>inter alia,</i> at issues relating to the delivery of maternity services in Dublin and the linkages with acute general hospitals across the city.  The emphasis in the group's report is on the provision of integrated gynaecology services utilising the maternity services and facilities provided by the existing maternity hospitals.</P>
    <P>Each of the maternity hospitals has an established set of links with the acute general hospitals. In the case of the new hospital at Tallaght, the linkage is with the Coombe Women's Hospital.</P>

      <P>My Department is approved for EU funding under the Community Support Framework for: training for people with disabilities as part of the Operational Programme for Human Resources 1994 to 1999 &mdash; EU funding comes from two sources, the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund; the Tallaght Hospital project &mdash; EU funding comes from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Training for people with Disabilities</i></P>
      <P>ESF funding totalling 149.7 mecu over the lifetime of the operational programme is available for the vocational training operations for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board is the national implementing authority for training for people with disabilities measure under the operational programme.  It co-ordinates the agencies' claims, monitors the programmes and disburses funds among the agencies.</P>
      <P>The Capital Programme for Vocational Training Centres Operational Programme provides for a capital allocation of 22.5 mecu from the European Regional Development Fund for vocational training centres for the period 1994-99. The capital programme has been drawn up regionally through co-ordinating committees chaired by each health board in consultation with training agencies to fully represent the immediate priorities for capital developments in the vocational training field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards and the NRB, as contracting agents for this funding within the operational programme, are responsible for the implementation of EU Directives on public procurement in the areas of works, supplies and services.  My Department, <Col N="779" /> as a matter of routine, advises health agencies in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the mid-term review decision on EU Structural Funding support, the Community Support Framework monitoring committee called for the examination by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the lead Department for the operational programme, of the scope for implementing change in pursuit of greater cost recovery, reduced aid rates, increased tendering for services and for more competition in the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>This and related qualitative issues were brought to the attention of the monitoring committee of the operational programme at its last meeting in October 1997.  It was agreed at that meeting that the qualitative issues would be followed up at future monitoring committee and co-ordinating committee meetings.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs will examine reports that increasing numbers of young people in certain areas in the State are smoking heroin and becoming addicted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22281/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no definitive figures for the total number of young people who are smoking heroin. However, the Health Research Board's report on treated misuse in Ireland in 1996 shows that, of the 4,865 cases treated for drug misuse, 642 young people in the 13-19 year old age bracket were treated for smoking heroin and 99 per cent of these were from the Eastern Health Board area. The Health Research Board's report shows that the primary drug of misuse in 79 per cent of cases being treated was an opiate, while the second highest percentage of cases treated was for cannabis at 12 per cent.  It must be remembered that these figures represent treated cases only and the number of people actually misusing these drugs would exceed these.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that there has been an increase in smoking the primary drug of misuse, from a figure of 54 per cent of those in the 15-19 year old bracket in 1995 to 65 per cent in 1996. There was a decrease in the numbers injecting drugs.  These figures may indicate that the public health message regarding the links between HIV and intravenous drug misuse is being heeded by drug misusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> I share the Deputy's concern, however, that those who commence smoking heroin run the risk of progressing to using the drug intravenously, thereby increasing the likelihood of becoming addicted.</P>
    <P>In order to address the problem of young heroin smokers the Eastern Health Board has put young people's programmes in place in its addiction centres at Baggot Street, City Clinic in Amiens Street and Aisling Clinic in Ballyfermot. There are currently 95 participants in total on these programmes.  Plans are in progress to develop another programme in Ballymun within the next few months and further expansion of the programmes is anticipated during the year, following the employment of four family therapists.</P>

      <P>The 2,276 reports of confirmed child abuse in 1995 are cases which are confirmed to the satisfaction of the health boards in pursuance of their statutory role to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  It would not always be possible or appropriate to initiate criminal proceedings in each of these cases.</P>
      <P>New procedures governing the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda were introduced in April 1995.  These procedures amend the 1987 child abuse guidelines and under them the health boards and the Garda are required to notify suspected cases of child abuse to each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to change the basis of entitlement to health services in Ireland to provide free general practitioner medical services to all. Approximately 35 per cent of the population hold medical cards under the general medical services scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons, who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, those whose income exceeds the guidelines may qualify for a medical card if their health board considers that they are unable to provide necessary medical care for themselves or their family.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to everyone without reference to their means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the finite resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to <Col N="782" /> above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department has made the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the review of the general medical services scheme that took place in 1992, and agreement reached in relation thereto with the Irish Medical Organisation in which all parties formally committed themselves to the achievement of responsible and cost-effective prescribing, the general practice development fund was established in 1993 with a value of £12.5 million and renewed annually since then.  In 1997, the inflator-adjusted fund for that year was £13.95 million.</P>
      <P>The fund is an integral feature of the State's commitment to the development of general practice and is used to promote developments in line with the blueprint document <i>The Future of General Practice in Ireland.</i>  The agreement referred to above provided for the general allocation of the fund and in 1997 the distribution, in line with that agreement, was as follows: first, £4,65 million in respect of the provision of realistic rostering and out of hours arrangements; second, £4 million to assist towards practice maintenance, equipment and development; third, £1.6 million in grant aid to facilitate the employment of practice secretaries and or nurses; and fourth £3.7 million for specific general practice developments, principally the ongoing funding of general practice units in all the individual health boards and such other developmental projects as were determined by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to be desirable either locally, regionally or nationally.  Moneys under the fund were also made available in 1997 to St. James's Hospital for the establishment of a national centre for pharmaco-economics and the Mater Hospital for the national development of the healthlink GP electronic messaging service. Funding for specific projects was made in the light of submissions made by health boards in respect of general practice projects either under way or contemplated by them.</P>
      <P>Payments for the fund under the first three headings were made directly to general practitioners pro rata to their GMS panel sizes. Moneys under the fourth heading were made available directly to health boards or the other body concerned.  It might be noted that this last component of the overall fund is the discretionary element of the fund which has come to be referred to, by some, as the GP development fund, notwithstanding the other elements in the total fund.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply to Question No. 294 of 16 December 1997.</P>
      <P>The updated position since then is as follows: Lord Belmore was appointed to the Board of the National Gallery of Ireland on 2 January 1998, Ms Anne Tannahill resigned from the RTÉ Authority on 30 December 1997 and Mr. John Gray and Mr. Barry Murphy have since been reappointed to the board of the National Library of Ireland, Council of Trustees.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to my reply of 16 December 1997, I have been informed that the players representative on the board of the National Theatre Society, Máire Ní Ghráinne, had been replaced by Niall O'Brien since 2 October 1997.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that I have no function in relation to the latter appointment.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that with regard to An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the date of expiry of appointments given in my reply to Question No. 294 of 16 December 1997 is not fixed.  Under the provisions of the Arts Acts a new council may be appointed at any time from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the vast majority of the boards under the aegis of my Department are to be found in the relevant establishing legislation and in the memoranda and articles of association in the case of bodies incorporated under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment I have met on a formal or informal basis with the majority of the boards and agencies which come under the aegis of my Department.  I am satisfied with the reports of progress furnished to me by those bodies.  Naturally, my Department is in constant touch with them to clarify any issues of concern.</P>
      <P>Some of my policy initiatives may lead to the establishment of new boards, for example, a music board.  I have no plans at present to reduce the number of boards etc.  under the aegis of my Department other than changes arising from the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, which provides for the establishment of autonomous boards for the National Museum and National Library.</P>

      <P>The National Museum is divided into four divisions as follows: Irish antiquities, folklife, natural history and art and industry.</P>
      <P>The Irish antiquities division of the Museum is the repository for archaeological objects.  Highlights in this collection collected in the past three years include a Viking decorated lead-weight, a Viking silver bracelet, a bronze cannon from a Spanish Armada ship, Trinidad Valencera, and a Late Bronze Age bracelet in gold from Mooghaun, County Clare.  The number of objects acquired since 1995 are as follows: 1995: 2,013 (as a result of the provisions contained in the National Monuments Act, 1994); 1996: 221; 1997:70.</P>
      <P>The folklife divisions collection describes the people of Ireland's domestic and intimate history from c. 1800 to c. 1950.  While there are no particular highlights, each one being unique, the collection includes artisan tools, furniture, settle beds, and clothing used by ordinary people.  The division acquired approximately 300 items in each of the years 1995 to 1997 inclusive.  Also in 1997 the division acquired the contents of a museum in Shrule, County Mayo, which closed down during that year.</P>
      <P>The natural history division holds the geological, zoological, and entomological archives of the people of Ireland.  Examples include 269 slides of aphids from England, Irish centipedes and millipedes, cave bear bones excavated at Armagh and a collection of birds eggs from St. Declan's School, Waterford.  The number of objects acquired since 1995 are as follows: 1995: 68 lots; 1996: 55 lots; 1997: 62 lots.  Lot describes a collection which can mean one single specimen or up to 10,000 specimens (as in the case of the Washington insect collection which contains c.10,000 specimens).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The art and industrial division holds the national historical and decorative arts collections. <Col N="819" /> The aim of the Division is to document the social, economic, military and political history of Ireland and, in the decorative arts, to relate Ireland's development in social, artistic, etc., matters to that in Europe, particularly from about 1700 AD. A breakdown of the acquisitions by the division are listed hereunder.</P>

      <P>Development of the National Botanic Gardens is being undertaken in accordance with the aims and objectives set out in the management plan published in 1992.  As <Col N="820" /> the Deputy is no doubt aware, much has been accomplished to date including the magnificent restoration of the curvilinear range, which has won a number of major architectural awards, the most prestigious being the Europa Nostra Medal presented last year.  In addition two important buildings &mdash; the director's and curator's residences &mdash; have been refurbished, the purpose designed Herbarium/Library was completed last year and replacement of propagation glasshouses is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>The proposed next phase of works for 1998-2000 involves the creation of new visitor, restaurant and educational facilities.  The proposals encompass a lecture/performance hall, restaurant and tearooms, visitor information and parking facilities.  To pave the way for the project and replace the existing inadequate facility, a new lecture hall is being provided for the Teagasc College of Amenity Horticulture.</P>
      <P>Plans for the restoration of the great palm house are also in hand.</P>
      <P>The staff complement at the National Botanic Gardens is currently 58, made up as follows:</P>

    <P>Consultant architects have carried out an initial report on Sligo courthouse and preliminary plans were drawn up.

    <P>Sligo County Council, who act as my Department's agents in relation to this project, have been drafting the advertisement and I understand that it will be submitted by them for inclusion in the official journal early next week.

The information requested by the Deputy in relation to number of applicants and places available by institution for the academic years 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 is as follows.</P>
      <P>The current quota for 800 for admissions to the Higher Diploma in Education was set on the basis of a recommendation by the Higher Education Authority.  The HEA's advice was based on recommendations of a working group composed of representatives of the universities, my Department and the authority.  The working group, under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, has been reconvened to undertake an in-depth review of future needs for second-level teachers.  This review is focusing both on total needs and on needs by subject grouping, where feasible.  The working group is examining all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks.</P>
      <P>The quota for admissions to the Higher Diploma in Education in future years will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the working group.</P>

      <P>The deliberations referred to by the Deputy are at an advanced stage following a detailed review of the Naas area carried out by the planning section of my Department.  At first level, this process includes ongoing consultations and meetings with representatives of existing primary schools in Naas.  A further meeting with this group is due to be held on 3 February next.</P>
      <P>With regard to second level schools, an extension has been approved for St. Mary's College. The project has progressed to detailed design stage and a submission in that regard is awaited from the school.  Approval has also been given for the provision of an extension to Naas CBS.  This project is now in the early stages of design.  An application for additional places at the vocational school is under consideration, also.</P>
      <P>The question of the availability of funding will depend on my Department's other commitments and priorities.  However, I am well aware of the situation in Naas and I again assure the Deputy that every effort will be made by my Department to resolve the accommodation difficulties in a timely manner.</P>

Indeed, I understand that the school has advised my Inspectorate that it no longer wishes to be considered for such classes.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue its efforts to put arrangements in place to meet the educational needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>I understand that the school in question has applied to my Department for the appointment of a resource teacher.  However, no application has been received from the school for the establishment of a special class.</P>
      <P>In March 1977, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997/98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of the surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and include the allocation of 26 resource teacher posts with effect from September, 1997.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional resource teacher posts to primary schools.  However, I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of Bunninadden national school and other schools in the south Sligo area will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also wish to note that the three children with Down's syndrome enrolled in the school will benefit from the services of a visiting teacher from this week on.</P>

      <P>The correspondence to which the Deputy refers requested the appointment of a second teacher to a primary school in County Sligo.  Currently the school in question is a one teacher school with an enrolment of 13 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, my predecessor agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year in consultation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>Since there are no teaching posts available for allocation in the current school year, I am at present examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitment to one teacher schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the prevalence of dyspraxia among children participating in the education system.</P>
      <P>Dyspraxia is a condition which affects a child's ability to carry out motor/sensory tasks.  A child affected by the condition may have a combination of problems in varying degrees.  In some case, children with dyspraxia may also have oral difficulties which delays speech and may require intensive speech therapy.</P>
      <P>No specific guidelines have been issued to schools in relation to dyspraxia.  However, the condition will manifest itself to class teachers in the difficulties which such children will encounter in performing voluntary movements with precision and co-ordination.  Such difficulties are likely to be particularly evident in areas such as handwriting; arts and crafts; and physical education. Where such difficulties do arise, the class teacher can highlight the problem so that the necessary remedial action can be taken.  The advice and guidance of my Department's inspectorate is available to schools in any such situations. A wide range of special support services is available to children with special needs, including children with dyspraxia.  In addition to the range of special schools and special classes dedicated to children with more serious conditions, children participating in the education system on an integrated basis are supported by the remedial, resource and visiting teacher services.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available for the purchase of specialised equipment for children with special education needs, including children with dyspraxia. I understand that at least one such child has been assisted under this arrangement.</P>
      <P>The precise nature of the required response in any individual case will of course depend on the needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case or cases in mind, he may wish to provide details to my Department so that the matter can be investigated further.</P>
